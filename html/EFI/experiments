					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Please post your ideas for experiment designs here. You can make them as detailed (i.e. narrative/description, factors, outcomes, etc. as required for the first peer assessment) or as simple as you like. In developing the course, we have sometimes struggled with providing realistic examples of experiments from a wide range of disciplines or areas of study. So your contributions will help us improve a great deal for the next offering of the course. Thanks to you! </p>

<ul>
<li>Testing whether Caffeine has a significant positive effect on how awake a person is</li>
</ul>
<p>In a group of test persons each one after another gets a cup of orange juice. With a chance of 50% the cup contains also 
200mg of Caffeine (a Caffeine pill which was crashed and mixed into it). They get askes by a survey how awake they feel on a scale from one to ten. They get asked again after 1 hour.</p>
<p>Factors: - Caffeine yes or no</p>
<p>Possible outcomes: - Rise of subjective feeling of being awake in the "placebo" as well as the testgroup. Possibly the test 
group, which really got the Caffeine, will score significantly higher on average.</p>
<p>Things to consider:
- Test persons must be aware that they may drink orange juice with coffein in it and be ok with that (possible allergies!)
- People with bad health (especially heart diseases) should be excluded (questionnairy before the test run).
- The probands should be sitting, not smoking, drinking eating or doing any kind of physical exercise in order to not influence the results. Maybe they could be, for example, watching a movie.</p>
