<p>We're going to take a look at how we should interpret results that confirm or disconfirm
our predictions and whether we should confirm or reject our hypothesis accordingly.</p>
<p>Let's consider the hypothesis that all mothers-in-law are horrible. I formulated this
hypothesis based on personal observations.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis I came up with a research setup. I selected to measure
horribleness using a rating scale with the options likable, neutral and horrible. I also
decided to collect data from ten colleagues in my department.</p>
<p>With the research setup in place, I formulated the following prediction:
If the hypothesis 'all mothers-in-law are horrible' is true then all ten colleagues should
choose the category 'horrible' to describe their mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Ok, let's look at <strong>confirmation</strong> first. Suppose all ten colleagues rated their mother-in-law
as horrible. The prediction is confirmed, but this doesn't mean the hypothesis has been
proven!</p>
<p>It's easily conceivable that we will be proven wrong in the future. If we were to repeat
the study we might find a person that simply adores their mother-in-law.</p>
<p>The point is that confirmation is never conclusive. The only thing we can say is that our
hypothesis is <strong>provisionally supported</strong>. The more support from different studies, the
more credence we afford a hypothesis, but we can never prove it.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that: No scientific empirical statement can ever be proven once and for
all. The best we can do is produce overwhelming support for a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Ok, now let's turn to <strong>disconfirmation</strong>. Suppose only eight out of ten colleagues rate
their mother-in-law as horrible and two actually rate her as neutral. Obviously in this
case our prediction turned out to be false.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, empirical findings that contradict the hypothesis should lead to its
rejection. If our hypothesis states that all swans are white and we then find black swans
in Australia, we can very conclusively reject our hypothesis.</p>
<p>In practice however, especially in the social sciences, there are often plausible
alternative explanations for our failure to confirm. These are in fact so easy to find that
we rarely reject the hypothesis outright.</p>
<p>In many cases these explanations have to do with methodological issues. The research
design or the measurement instrument wasn't appropriate, maybe relevant background
variables weren't controlled for; etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p>Coming back to our mother-in-law example: I could have made a procedural error
while collecting responses from the two colleagues who rated their mother-in-law as
neutral.</p>
<p>Maybe I forgot to tell them their responses were confidential, making them
uncomfortable to choose the most negative category.</p>
<p>If there are plausible methodological explanations for the failure to confirm we preserve
the hypothesis and instead choose to reject the auxiliary, implicit assumptions
concerning the research design and the measurement. We investigate the original
hypothesis again, only with a better research setup.</p>
<p>Sometimes results do give rise to a <strong>modification</strong> of the hypothesis. Suppose that the
eight colleagues who did have horrible mothers-in-law were all women and the other
two were men. Perhaps all mothers-in-law are indeed horrible, but only to their
daughters-in-law!</p>
<p>If we alter the hypothesis slightly by adding additional clauses (it only applies to
daughters-in-law), then strictly speaking we are rejecting the original hypothesis, sort
of.</p>
<p>Of course the new hypothesis is essentially the same as the original one, just not as
general and therefore not as strong.</p>
<p>An outright rejection or radical adjustment of a hypothesis is actually very rare in the
social sciences. Progress is made in very small increments not giant leaps.</p>
