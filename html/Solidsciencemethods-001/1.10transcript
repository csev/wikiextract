<p>Of course the ultimate, general goal of science is to gain knowledge. But we can
distinguish more specific <strong>goals</strong>. These goals differ in terms of the <em>type of knowledge</em> we want to obtain and for what <em>purpose</em> we want to obtain it.</p>
<p><strong>Universalistic</strong> research tries to provide explanations that apply generally. For example, we could hypothesize that playing violent computer games leads to aggressive
behavior. The specific game, or the type of person playing it, is not relevant here,
because we assume the relation between violent game play and aggression holds for
any violent game, be it GTA, Call of Duty, any other game. We also assume the
relation holds for men and women, of any age, in any cultural setting.</p>
<p>Universalistic research aims to describe or explain phenomena that apply to all people
or all groups, or societies.</p>
<p>The scientific method can also be used for <strong>Particularistic</strong> research purposes.
Particularistic research is aimed at describing or explaining a phenomenon that occurs
in a specific setting or concerns a specific group.</p>
<p>For example, we could investigate the change in the number of Dutch teenagers
hospitalized for alcohol poisoning just after the legal drinking age was first raised from 16 to 18 years in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The point here is to investigate the size of an effect for a specific group in a specific location, during a very specific time. We wouldn't necessarily expect to find the same effect in a different country or in ten years time, if the drinking age was changed again.</p>
<p>Ok, so the goal of research can either be universalistic or particularistic. Or in less
fancy terms: aimed at obtaining general versus specific knowledge. A very closely
related and largely overlapping distinction is between <strong>fundamental</strong> and <strong>applied</strong>
research.</p>
<p><strong>Applied research</strong> is directly aimed at solving a problem. It develops or applies
knowledge in order to improve "the human condition".</p>
<p>Suppose we want to help depressed people and we think that depression is caused by
loneliness. We could create a program that aims to lower depression by making people
less lonely. We could give lonely depressed people a cat to take care of and investigate if their feelings of depression actually go down now that theyâ€™re no longer lonely.</p>
<p>Applied research can be contrasted with <strong>fundamental research</strong>. In fundamental
research, the aim is to obtain knowledge just "for the sake of knowing"; the only
purpose of fundamental research is to further our understanding of the world around us,
nothing more. It doesn't have an immediate application; it doesn't directly solve a problem.</p>
