<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Welcome_to_This_Astrobiology_and_the_Search_for_Extraterrestrial_Life_Course.">Welcome to This <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/astrobio-001/lecture/index">Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life Course</a>.</span></h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Course_Logistics">Course Logistics</span></h2>
<p>Course logistics - Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life</p>
<p>Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life is made up of five weeks of study.</p>
<p>Each week is broadly divided into two segments which cover a particular topic. For example, in week 1 the first segment is an introduction to astrobiology and life and segment two is an introduction to the origin of life. So the whole week is about an introduction to life and the origin of life. In week 2 the first segment deals with conditions on the early Earth and evidence for life and the second segment is about major events in the evolution of life on the Earth, so week 2 is about the rise of life.</p>
<p>Each segment has one to four lectures associated with it. The lectures are available on our course website and the associated powerpoint slides can also be downloaded from the site. In some cases there are associated papers and other information you might find useful.</p>
<p>In each segment there is a quiz to test your knowledge. This means there are two quizzes per week (one for each 'segment'), except for week 1 where there are three quizzes (an extra short one is in that week).</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_assessment_of_the_course_that_leads_to_the_certificate_is_based_on_the_results_of_the_quizzes._This_is_how_it_works:">The assessment of the course that leads to the certificate is based on the results of the quizzes. This is how it works:</span></h3>
<p>You get three attempts at each quiz if you require it. There is no deduction for trying the quiz twice, but on the third attempt you get 80% of your total mark by default. Your maximum score is used of the attempts you made on the quiz. You can complete the quizzes at any time during the week in which they are relevant.</p>
<p>You also get the chance to do the quiz for one week after the end of the week in which they are relevant (so you could do Week 1 quizzes until the end of Week 2), but you get a flat 20% reduction for submitting after the week deadline and then a 5% deduction on your mark for every day after the end of the week in which the quiz is associated. So we'd recommend doing the quiz during the relevant week. You'll also find this a better learning experience as you can focus during each week on the material at hand, rather than trying to handle two week's information at once.</p>
<p>At the end of the course you'll need to get greater than 65% average mark on all your quizzes combined to pass the course. Greater than 85% constitutes a 'distinction'.</p>
<p>The quizzes are a mix of two types of questions: 1) radio buttons in which you select one of the answers on offer; 2) check box questions. In check box questions you may need to select more than one answer on offer and you get a mark deduction for incorrectly checked boxes.</p>
<p>We hope this information is useful.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Syllabus">Syllabus</span></h2>
<p>The summarized syllabus for the course:</p>
<p>Week 1: What is life and what are the definitions of life? What do we know about the origin of life and what are the current hypotheses for how it originated on the Earth?</p>
<p>Week 2: What was the environment of early Earth like when life first emerged and what do we know about life on the earliest Earth? How did life evolve to cope with survival in extreme environments? What have been the major evolutionary transitions of life on the Earth?</p>
<p>Week 3: What are the prospects for life on other planetary bodies in our Solar System and how do we go about searching for it? What conditions are required for a planet to be habitable?</p>
<p>Week 4: How do we search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars and how would we detect life on them?</p>
<p>Week 5: What are the possibilities for intelligent life elsewhere? How would we deal with contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence and what would be the impact on society? Who would represent Earth? </p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="About_Us_-_The_Teachers">About Us - The Teachers</span></h2>
<p>This course has been put together by three enthusiastic astrobiologists at the UK Centre for Astrobiology (UKCA): Charles Cockell, Jesse Harrison and Casey Bryce.</p>
<p>Here is some information about us:</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Charles_Cockell">Charles Cockell</span></h3>
<p>is Professor of Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh. He received his doctorate at the University of Oxford and was a National Research Council Associate at the NASA Ames Research Centre. He was a visiting scholar at Stanford University and the University of Arizona. Cockell is currently Director of the UK Centre for Astrobiology and his research interests focus on how microbes survive in extreme environments, including volcanic and impact crater environments. Cockell is a Senior Editor of the journal, Astrobiology. His popular science books include ‘Impossible Extinction’ (Cambridge University Press), which explores the tenacity of microbes on the Earth, and ‘Space on Earth’ (Macmillan) which looks at the links between environmentalism and space exploration. He is Chair of the Earth and Space Foundation, a non-profit organisation he established in 1994. He was the first Chair of the Astrobiology Society of Britain.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Jesse_Harrison">Jesse Harrison</span></h3>
<p>joined the UK Centre for Astrobiology (UKCA) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in June 2012. His research focuses on microbial growth and preservation under combinations of several physical and chemical extremes. He also has broad research interests in microbial ecology, environmental microbiology and biodiversity. Prior to joining the UKCA, Jesse completed his Ph.D. at the University of Sheffield and in collaboration with the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. His doctorate research project focused on the detection and bacterial colonization of microplastic debris in marine sediments.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Casey_Bryce">Casey Bryce</span></h3>
<p>is a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. She gained her undergraduate degree in Earth Sciences from the University of Glasgow in 2011. She has a keen interest in the geology of the Earth and other planets in the solar system, especially the unravelling of Earth’s earliest history through the rock record and the influence of biology on geology through time. Her current research is involved with investigating the way in which microbes alter and are altered by the rocks around them.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Suggested_Reading">Suggested Reading</span></h2>
<p>There are many books on astrobiology. These books are not required for the course and they are not used specifically with the lectures. These are just some of our suggestions for books that might be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction by Kevin W. Plaxco and Michael Gross.</strong>
A good basic introduction to Astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology by W. Sullivan and J. Baross. Cambridge University Press.</strong>
A little pricey, but quite comprehensive survey of astrobiology</p>
<p><strong>An Introduction to Astrobiology by D. A. Rothery, I. Gilmour and M.A. Sephton. Open University</strong>
A good summary of many topics in astrobiology.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_instructors_have_also_written_astrobiology-related_books.2C_which_you_are_not_required_to_read.21">Your instructors have also written astrobiology-related books, which you are not required to read!</span></h2>

<p>A book about the remarkable tenacity of microbes on the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>An Introduction to the Earth-Life System by CS Cockell, R Corfield, N. Edwards, N. Harris.</strong></p>
<p>A text book about the co-evolution of life and planet Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Space on Earth: Saving Our World by Seeking Others by C S Cockell.</strong></p>
