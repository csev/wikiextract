<p><strong>Page 376</strong> In several places in the problem descriptions for 9.11.13 and 9.11.14, a caret symbol is used to represent the solution vector, as in "find a vector ^ that minimizes $$\| A\verb.^.-b\|$$.  Some symbol, perhaps $${v}$$ is required to represent the vector variable.</p>
<p><strong>Page 397</strong> A minus sign is missing in the exponent in the following line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, we can multiply by $$\mathcal{F}^{-1}$$ by first multiplying by $$W(e^{2\pi\mathbf{i}/n},n)$$...</li>
</ul>
<p>The expression using $$W$$ should instead be $$W(e^{-2\pi\mathbf{i}/n},n)$$, with a negative exponent.</p>
<p><strong>Page 398</strong> The FFT explanation could be improved by mentioning one more key equation, i.e. $$\omega^k = -\omega^{k+\frac{n}{2}}$$.  We could further explain that this is because $$\omega^{k+\frac{n}{2}} = \omega^k\cdot\omega^{\frac{n}{2}}$$ and $$\omega^{\frac{n}{2}} = e^{\frac{2\pi\mathbf{i}}{n}\cdot{\frac{n}{2}}} = e^{\pi\mathbf{i}} = -1$$ due to Euler's equation.  Without this explanation the reader (like me) might be baffled by the line <code>[f0[j]-w**j*f1[j] for j in range(n//2)]</code> in the <code>FFT()</code> Python function.</p>
<p><strong>Page 400</strong> In example 10.7.3 there is a bit of unescaped LaTeX: "$$= 1 + 1 + cdots + 1$$"</p>
<p><strong>Page 402</strong> Near the bottom of the page, there is a typo where $$\omega^{2\cdot j} \quad \omega^{3\cdot j}$$ appear adjacent to each other instead of vertically aligned.</p>
<p>The matrix shown should be $$\begin{bmatrix} \omega^{0\cdot j} &#92;&#92; \omega^{1\cdot j} &#92;&#92; \omega^{2\cdot j} &#92;&#92; \omega^{3\cdot j} \end{bmatrix}$$ instead of $$\begin{bmatrix} \omega^{0\cdot j} &#92;&#92; \omega^{1\cdot j} &#92;&#92; \omega^{2\cdot j} \quad \omega^{3\cdot j} \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p><strong>Page 410</strong> On the third line on the page, <code>getkeys(dlist, k)</code> is inconsistent with section 10.9.7 on page 407.  The function should be referred to as <code>dictlist_helper(D_list, k)</code> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Page 412</strong> Task 10.9.15 through 10.9.18.  In order to successfully compress images, 2 additional coding changes are needed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the function <code>forward_no_normalization()</code> needs to be augmented to pad the input vector with zeroes to make the length a power of 2, i.e. pad to the length $$2^{(int(log(len(v)-1, 2))+1)}$$.</li>
<li>Secondly, we need to add a helper function <code>image_round()</code> that will take the image (list of list of floats) returned from the 2-dimensional backward wavelet transform and round each float to an integer.  If we don't do this, the routine <code>image.image2display()</code> fails, because the image module assumes in the function <code>isgray()</code> that only images with integer-valued pixels are grayscale images.  When it sees float values, <code>image2display()</code> tries to process the input list-of-lists as a color image and throws a runtime error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Page 424</strong> In example 11.3.4, the second right singular vector is $$[.63, -.78]$$, not $$[.63, 78]$$ as written.</p>
<p><strong>Page 427</strong> Lemma 11.3.11: Let $$[{w}&#95;1, \ldots, {w}&#95;k]$$ be an orthonormal vector basis...</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to be consistent with the rest of the text, the above line and the remainder of the lemma definition should use $$[{v}&#95;1, \ldots, {v}&#95;k]$$ as the orthonormal vector basis rather than $$[{w}&#95;1, \ldots, {w}&#95;k]$$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Page 433</strong> 3 corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equation (11.19) is incorrect.  The norm of $$AVw$$ should not be squared, i.e. the equation should say "$$\| AVw \| \geq \sigma^2&#95;k + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r$$" instead of "$$\| AVw \|^2 \geq \sigma^2&#95;k + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r$$"</li>
<li>Equation (11.20) should use $$\sigma&#95;k$$ instead of $$\sigma$$.  The complete equation should be:<br />
$$\frac{\| AVw \|}{\| Vw \|} \geq \frac{\sigma^2&#95;k + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r}{\sqrt{\sigma^2&#95;k + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r}} = \sqrt{\sigma^2&#95;k + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r}$$<br />
...and not:<br />
$$\frac{\| AVw \|}{\| Vw \|} \geq \frac{\sigma^2 + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r}} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \beta^2&#95;{k+1} + \ldots + \beta^2&#95;r}$$</li>
<li>On the line following equation (11.20), the last $$Vw$$ on the line should use normal math font rather than calligraphic because it represents here a matrix and not a vector space, i.e. it should read "...normalizing $$Vw$$, i.e. $$v = \frac{1}{\| Vw \|}Vw$$." and not "...normalizing $$Vw$$, i.e. $$v = \frac{1}{\| Vw \|}\mathcal{V}w$$."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Page 436</strong> Task 11.6.5 has:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Input:</em> A vector , and a matrix $${M}$$ ...</li>
<li><em>Output:</em> The square of the norm of the projection of  into the space...</li>
</ul>
<p>On both lines the symbol $${x}$$ is missing.  So the text for input should read "A vector $${x}$$, and a matrix $${M}$$...", and for output "The square of the norm of the projection of $${x}$$ into the space...".  The same type of error needs to be corrected in tasks 11.6.4, 11.6.6, and 11.6.10.</p>
<p><strong>Page 443</strong> One suggested addition and one correction.
<ul><li> The symbol $$\Lambda$$ is used without prior introduction.  The explanation would be easier to follow with some additional text before discussing $$A^t$$:  </p>
</li></ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $$\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} &amp; \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} &#92;&#92; 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}$$<br />
  $$\qquad \Lambda = S^{-1}AS$$<br />
  $$\qquad S\Lambda S^{-1} = (SS^{-1})A(S^{-1}S) = A$$<br />
  $$\qquad A^t = \underbrace{A \cdotp A \cdots A}$$<br />
  $$\qquad \ldots$$</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The last matrix in the Proof box lower down on the page has not been rendered correctly, because its two elements are shown adjacent to each other instead of one below the other.  The relevant line should be:<br />
$$\qquad = \begin{bmatrix} s&#95;{11}c&#95;1\lambda&#95;1^t + s&#95;{12}c&#95;2\lambda&#95;2^t &#92;&#92; s&#95;{21}c&#95;1\lambda&#95;1^t + s&#95;{22}c&#95;2\lambda&#95;2^t \end{bmatrix}$$<br />
...instead of:<br />

</ul>
<p><strong>Page 445</strong> Two corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typo in the first paragraph: "seen diagonalization one before" should be "seen diagonalization <em>once</em> before".</li>
<li>There is a missing variable $$e&#95;1$$ in Example 12.3.3.  The text should read "$$Ae&#95;1 = \lambda&#95;1e&#95;1, \ldots, Ae&#95;n = \lambda&#95;ne&#95;n$$" instead of "$$Ae&#95;1 = \lambda&#95;1, \ldots, Ae&#95;n = \lambda&#95;ne&#95;n$$" </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Page 446</strong> Typo on line 7 where $$v$$ is used instead of $$u$$.  The relevant sentence should be "Let $$u$$ be a non-zero vector in the null space." instead of "Let $$v$$ be a non-zero vector in the null space."</p>
<p><strong>Page 447</strong> Typo in the initial sentence of example 12.3.11, which should read "...because $$A$$ is upper triangular." and not "...because $$U$$ is upper triangular".</p>
<p><strong>Page 448</strong> Near the middle of the page, see the sentence "Let $$\lambda&#95;1, \ldots, \lambda&#95;n$$ be the diagonal elements of $$\Lambda$$, which are the eigenvalues of $$A$$, and let $$v&#95;1, \ldots, v&#95;n$$ be the corresponding eigenvectors..."<br />
<ul><li> For consistency with the subsequent text, one possible correction would be to refer to the eigenvectors as $$u&#95;1, \ldots, u&#95;n$$ rather than $$v&#95;1, \ldots, v&#95;n$$.
</li><li> But since $$u^{(0)}$$ and $$u^{(t)}$$ have already been used for the representation of the $$x$$ vectors in terms of the eigenvector basis, a better correction would be to leave the above text in place and change the equations on the rest of the page (everything leading up to equation 12.5) to refer to the eigenvectors as $$v&#95;1, \ldots, v&#95;n$$.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Page 451</strong> Just after the Proof box, "Combing Lemma 12.6.2 with..." should be "<em>Combining</em> Lemma 12.6.2 with..."</p>
<p><strong>Page 459</strong> Last line, the single vertical bar to the left of $$a&#95;2$$ should be a double vertical bar, i.e. "...two sides, so $$\|a&#95;1\| |a&#95;2\|$$" should instead be "...two sides, so $$\|a&#95;1\| \|a&#95;2\|$$" </p>
<p><strong>Page 466</strong> In the second sentence in the Proof box, the word "be" is repeated: "These $$n + 1$$ vectors belong to $$\mathbb{C}^n$$, so they must <strong>be be</strong> linearly dependent."</p>
<p><strong>Page 467</strong> Two corrections:
<ul><li> Just after equation 12.17, $$\lambda$$ should be used instead of $$\alpha$$, i.e. "for some complex numbers $$\beta, \alpha&#95;1, \alpha&#95;2, \ldots, \alpha&#95;k$$ where $$\beta \neq 0$$." should be corrected to $$\beta, \lambda&#95;1, \lambda&#95;2, \ldots, \lambda&#95;k$$ where $$\beta \neq 0$$."
</li><li> Last line, "Now we prove Theorem 12.6.9" should be "Now we prove theorem <em>12.6.4</em>"</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>page 481</strong>: in 13.1 line -5: in found in should be found in</p>
<p><strong>Page 482</strong> Some typos:</p>
<ul>
<li>"George Danzig wrote his dissertion..." should be "George <em>Dantzig</em> wrote his <em>dissertation</em>..."</li>
<li>"...his algorithm it, the simplex algorithm" should be "...his algorithm <em>for</em> it, the simplex algorithm"</li>
</ul>
