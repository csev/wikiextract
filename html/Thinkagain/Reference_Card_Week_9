<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Paradox_of_vagueness">Paradox of vagueness</span></h1>
<p>A paradox is an argument that seems valid, whose premises seem true yet whose conclusion seems false.</p>
<code><pre>Walter is not bald  
You cannot turn a non-bald person into a bald person by removing 1 hair  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------  
.: No matter how many hairs Walter loses, he will still not be bald  
</pre></code>
<p>The reason of this paradox is because the definition of "bald" is vague. A person with one single hair can indeed be considered bald. If you define precisely what "bald" means, the paradox disappears.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fallacies_of_vagueness">Fallacies of vagueness</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual slippery slope argument: same as a paradox of vagueness except that the vague term is a matter of degree (e.g. habitable / inhabitable) rather than a true/false state</li>
<li>Causal slippery slope argument: the premise that shows the slippery slope ("if you pass a restrictive bill, then another even more restrictive bill will be passed") is not true</li>
<li>Fairness slippery slope argument: use fairness as the vague term.</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fallacies_of_ambiguity">Fallacies of ambiguity</span></h1>
<p>Fallacies of ambiguity (aka of equivocation) rely on two types of ambiguities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic ambiguity: when a single word can have several meanings</li>
<li>Syntactic ambiguity: ambiguity of the grammar in the whole phrase of sentence</li>
</ul>
