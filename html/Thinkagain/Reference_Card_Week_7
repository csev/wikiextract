<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Causal_Reasoning">Causal Reasoning</span></h1>
<p>This type of inductive argument tries to explain a given outcome. It is based on generalizations (One event causes another event) that only work in a certain range of circumstances.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sufficient_.2F_Necessary_conditions">Sufficient / Necessary conditions</span></h2>
<code><pre>F is a SUFFICIENT condition for G =  
  IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES  
  whenever event F happens, an event G also happens  
  anything that has feature F also has feature G  
  f ⊃ g
  F =&gt; G (in math)

F is a NECESSARY condition for G =  
  IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES  
  whenever event F does not happen, an event G also does not happen  
  anything that does not have feature F does not have feature G either  
  ~f ⊃ ~g  
  F &lt;= G (in math)
</pre></code>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_conditions">Kinds of conditions</span></h2>
<p>Conceptual: feature F is necessary for feature G<br />
Causal: event F is sufficient for event G<br />
Moral: torturing for fun is sufficient for doing wrong</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sufficient_Condition_Tests">Sufficient Condition Tests</span></h2>
<p>Negative sufficient condition test: X is NOT a sufficient condition of Y if there is any case where X is present and Y is absent</p>
<p>Positive test: we have good reason to believe X is a sufficient condition of Y if all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have not found any case where X is present and Y absent (i.e. no negative sufficient condition)</li>
<li>We have tested a wide variety of cases, including cases where X is present and cases where Y is absent</li>
<li>If there are any other feature that are never present where Y is absent, then we have tested cases where those other features are absent but X is present (i.e. no competing hypothesis)</li>
<li>We have tested enough cases of various kinds that likely to include a case where X is present and Y is absent IF there is any such case ("enough cases" depends on a lot of factors and common knowledge)</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Necessary_Condition_Tests">Necessary Condition Tests</span></h2>
<p>Negative necessary Condition Tests: X is not a necessary condition of Y if there is any case where X is absent and Y is present.</p>
<p>Positive necessary Condition Tests: we have good reason to believe X is a necessary condition of Y if all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have not found any case where X is absent and Y is present (i.e. no negative necessary condition)</li>
<li>We have tested a wide variety of cases, included where X is absent and cases where Y is present</li>
<li>If there are any other feature that are never absent where Y is present, then we have tested cases where those other feature are present but X is absent</li>
<li>We have tested enough cases of various kinds that likely to include a case where X is absent and Y is present IF there is any such case</li>

<p>Some tests are not just black &amp; white, and come in degrees.</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="X_and_Y_are_positively_correlated_when:">X and Y are positively correlated when:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>the degree of X increases as the degree of Y increases, and</li>
<li>the degree of X decreases as the degree of Y decreases</li>
</ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="X_and_Y_are_negatively_correlated_when:">X and Y are negatively correlated when:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>the degree of X increases as the degree of Y decreases, and</li>
<li>the degree of X decreases as the degree of Y increases</li>
</ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="If_A_and_B_are_correlated.2C_is_it_because:">If A and B are correlated, is it because:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>A causes B</li>
<li>B causes A</li>
<li>C causes both A and B</li>
<li>the correlation accidental?</li>
</ul>
<p>Several tools can be used to help determine what helps what: time (if A causes B, then A has to happen before B), changing A and see if B changes (if it does, then A causes B).</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Common_fallacies">Common fallacies</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Confusing an accidental correlation with causation</li>
<li>Confusing cause with effect (believing A causes B when it's the other way around)</li>
</ul>
