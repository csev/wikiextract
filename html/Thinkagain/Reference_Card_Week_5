<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Categorical_logic">Categorical logic</span></h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Categorical_Propositions">Categorical Propositions</span></h2>
<p>There are four types, or forms, of propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Universal affirmative: "All A are B."  </li>
<li>E: Universal negative: "No A are B."  </li>
<li>I: Particular affirmative: "Some A are B."  </li>
<li>O: Particular negative: "Some A are not B."</li>
<li>The universal forms are said to lack existential commitment. This means they do not imply the existence of the subject category: "All A are B" does not imply any A exists.  </li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Examples">Examples</span></h3>
<p>"All squares are rectangles, all rectangles have parallel sides =&gt; All squares have parallel sides" can be turned into "All squirrels are mammals, all mammals are animals =&gt; All squirrels are animals"</p>
<p>Or more generally "all F are G, all G are H =&gt; all F are H", F, G, H being categories</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Diagramming_Categorical_Propositions">Diagramming Categorical Propositions</span></h3>
<p>A Venn Diagram can be used to represent categories and their relationships. In the above example, there would be a circle F, inside a larger circle G, which is itself inside a larger circle H. More generally, three overlapping circles F, G and H can be used to represent such relationships:</p>
<p>Each categorical proposition can also be represented in a Venn diagram.  In this case, two overlapping circles F and G can be used to represent the relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: All F are G (it does NOT mean there is any F): the part of the F circle not inside of G is shaded out</li>
<li>E: No F are G: the intersection of the F and G circles is shaded out</li>
<li>I: Some F are G: the intersection of the F and G circles has an X  </li>
<li>O: Some F are not G: the part of the F circle which is not inside the G circle has an X  </li>
</ul>
<p>Contradictory Propositions:
- "Some F are G" is the negation of "No F are G".<br />
- "Some F are not G" is the negation of "All F are G".<br />
- For contradictory propositions, one and only one must be true.   </p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Syllogisms">Syllogisms</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Syllogisms have the form of  A/E/I/O + A/E/I/O =&gt; A/E/I/O</li>
<li>They have a subject term, a middle term and a predicate term.</li>
</ul>
<p>They can be represented using Venn diagrams with 3 circles. Go through each line and either shade out each section which doesn't apply or put an X in the areas that apply (when an area is divided in two, put the X on the border).</p>
