<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_spot_an_argument.3F">How to spot an argument?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Certain words indicate that some sentences are intended as reasons for other sentences: "therefore", "thus", "hence", etc. In such cases, you cannot switch the sentences around the word (e.g. "therefore") without changing the meaning, whereas you can switches sentences around words such as "and"</li>
<li>These words are called argument markers

<ul>
<li>"therefore" or "thus" are conclusion markers because what comes after is the conclusion</li>
<li>"Because" or "and the reason why" are a premise or reason markers because what comes after is the reason/premise</li>
<li>Some words can only be argument markers in certain context. "Since" can be a reason marker ("I am good at sports since I am tall") but not always ("I am up since 7:00"). A good test is to see if you can substitute the word with another argument marker. But sometimes it can not even be clear.</li>
<li>"If" is seldom an argument marker</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Standard_Form">Standard Form</span></h2>
<p>Some sentences use a different order but mean the same thing. Other time, changing the argument marker can change the meaning. In order to compare arguments, we can put them in standard form:</p>
<code><pre>(1) premise  
(2) premise  
etc.  
------------  
.: (3)conclusion (from 1-2)
</pre></code>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Argument_Justification">Argument Justification</span></h2>
<p>For an argument to be valid, the premises need to be accepted as true</p>
<p>Problem of the skeptical regress: if any premise must be backed up by an argument, there is no end in. There are three main options out of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>unjustified premise</li>
<li>circular structure of arguments (e.g. self-justified argument)</li>
<li>infinite chain of arguments, but they're unverifiable</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, those three ways would allow to prove just about anything.</p>
<p>In everyday life, we cannot know everything for certain nor have the time to verify everything, so we solve the skeptical regress problem by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuring: accept the premise without much explanation (It shouldn't be used when nobody's contesting the claim)

<ul>
<li>Authoritative (citing an authoritative opinion). Works as long as the audience trusts the authority (beware of "[anonymous] sources familiar to the matter")</li>
<li>Reflexive ("I believe that", "I feel sure that"). Can be used as a bad way.</li>
<li>Abusive: belittles people who disagree with you ("nonsense!", "nobody but a fool would think that", "It's just common sense that"). Be careful of subtle abuses like assurances that move the attention away from the actual premise, or subtle switches from dropping the assurance to make it a fact</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Guarding: making the premises weaker so it's harder to object them ("I believe X might happen" rather than "X will happen"). But if the premise is too weak the argument won't hold.

<ul>
<li>Guarding by extent: weakening beyond what would otherwise be expected (e.g. changing "all" with "most", "many" or "some")</li>
<li>Probability: changing from "it's certain" to "It's likely", "there's a chance", "it might"</li>
<li>Mental: changing "I know" to "I believe", "Tend to believe" or "Inclined to believe"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discounting: citing a possible objection in order to counter it

<ul>
<li>Discounting terms such as "but" or "although" assert two claims, contrasts them and emphasize one of the claims. Substituting sentences around a discounting word changes the meaning of the argument</li>
<li>Straw people discounting trick: cite several objections but only discount the easy ones, so people forget the other. This trick can be combined with another trick such as guarding.</li>
<li>Rule of thumb: think about the objections the arguer is NOT considering</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, base the arguments on some assumptions that you share with your audience. So the most important thing is to FIND SHARED ASSUMPTIONS.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Evaluative_Language">Evaluative Language</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>We always need to make an evaluation at some point ("X is good")</li>
<li>Expressing preferences ("I like X") is different than making an evaluation ("It's wrong to X")</li>
<li>Calling something "good" in an argument relies on a standard that doesn't get specified, making the claim more defensible since our standards cannot be questions if they are not represented</li>
<li>We don't always have to agree what the standards are. Several people might agree to the same argument because they have different standards (e.g. they'll find that X is good for different reasons)</li>
<li>Evaluation can occur a lot of different levels:

<ul>
<li>General level, that can applied to pretty much everything (good/bad, should/shouldn't, right/wrong, etc.)</li>
<li>Specific level, that can only applied to a certain type of things (beautiful/ugly, cruel/brave)</li>
<li>You need to define the specific evaluative words in terms of the more general ones (X is cruel means X is bad). What makes words evaluative is their connection to what is good or bad, should or shouldn't, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some words are contextually evaluative. They are not necessarily good or bad, and are only evaluative in some contexts (e.g. the word "liberal" might be good or bad depending on the context)</li>
<li>Language will be considered evaluative only when it is only and literally evaluative</li>
<li>Combining several evaluative words (good or bad) can give unexpected results. "Pretty darn good" (2 good words + 1 bad word) is stronger than good (1 good word) which is stronger than "pretty good" (2 good words)</li>
<li>Think about the standards you are applying and the audience's when you make evaluation</li>
<li>Slanting is using some evaluative terms with no reason (saying "X is an idiot" with no reason)</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Close_Analysis">Close Analysis</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Close Analysis allows to see how are the types of words interplay. Using the following notation when looking at a written argument:

<ul>
<li>Reason Marker -&gt; R</li>
<li>Conclusion Marker -&gt; C</li>
<li>Assuring Term -&gt; A</li>
<li>Guarding Term -&gt; G</li>
<li>Discounting Term -&gt; D</li>
<li>Positive Evaluative Term -&gt; E+</li>
<li>Negative Evaluative Term -&gt; E-</li>
<li>Neutral / Nothing -&gt; N</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Best way to learn how to use Close Analysis: PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, best with good arguments</li>
</ul>
