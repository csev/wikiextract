<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_an_argument.3F">What is an argument?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Arguments are not fights. You cannot win an argument just by yelling at someone, nor by abusing someone, calling them nasty names or complaining</li>
<li>An argument is a process (set of premises) intended to give a reason for the conclusion</li>
<li>It can be intended to establish a given proposition, but in other cases the goal is to understand the proposition (why it's true)</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_of_an_argument">Definition of an argument</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>a series of sentences, statements or propositions </li>
<li>where some are the premises </li>
<li>and one is the conclusion </li>
<li>where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion </li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_arguments_used_for.3F">What are arguments used for?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Persuasion: changing people's belief. Good or bad reasons may be used </li>
<li>Justification: give reason to believe something. Only good reasons should be used </li>
<li><p>Explanation: understanding why a conclusion is true (which is already agreed upon) by fitting in a known pattern. There are several types of explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Causal: A happened because B happened (the train emitted a loud noise because the conductor pulled the lever) </li>
<li>Teleogical: what was the goal? (the train emitted a loud noise to warn people) </li>
<li>Formal: looks at the shape or form of the thing to be explained (the train emitted a loud noise because the whistle has the right shape) </li>
<li>Material: explanation from a physical point of view (the train whistle blew because of the properties of air) </li>
</ul>
<p>Several forms: general principles + initial conditions -&gt; phenomenon to be explained </p></li>
<li>note that general principles + initial conditions is NOT always a prediction </li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Language is crucial to arguments</li>
<li>Language is 1) important 2) conventional 3) representational and 4) social. </li>
<li>Interestingly, we can use a language without knowing all its rules (like pronunciation)</li>
<li>To understand the meaning of a word or a sentence, we need to understand its use</li>
<li>Language has several levels:

<ul>
<li>Linguistic level (meaningful utterance which has a meaning) </li>
<li>Speech act level (e.g. advising, arguing). A speech act occurs even if the intended effect does not occur: that is, even if the audience does not care about or heed the words. Note that some speech acts can have real impact, such as when a Minister pronounces a couple married. A speech act is defined by passing the "Thereby test" (if I say, "I &#95;&#95;&#95;," in the appropriate circumstances, then I thereby ___)</li>
<li>Conversational act level (e.g. persuasion).

<ul>
<li>a speech act is often associated with a particular effect (the conversational act). Apologizing asks for forgiveness, asking a question begs for an answer.</li>
<li>the conversational act does not occur when the effect does not occur</li>
<li>when cooperating, people should follow the conversational maxims: quantity (don't say to much or too little), quality (say the truth), relevance, manner (be brief, orderly, avoid obscurity or ambiguitiy). Dishonnest people will often break those maxims</li>
<li>conversational implication is an implication on the assumption someone is cooperative (saying "you can have pie" implies "you cannot have ice cream"). When someone is not cooperative it can be lying by omission. It is NOT a logical implication ("I have a sister" -&gt; "she's female")</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>conversational implication can be denied by an explicit fact ("you can also have ice cream")</li>
</ul>
