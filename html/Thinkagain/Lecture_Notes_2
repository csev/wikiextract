<li>How can we tell when an argument is being given?

<ul>
<li>Certain sentences are intended as reasons for other sentences.</li>
<li>We can tell the person's intentions by which words they choose.</li>
<li>Certain words indicate that some sentences are reasons for others. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
[1] I am tall, **and** I am good at sports.
[2] I am tall, **so** I am good at sports.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><code>[1]</code> The first sentence can be switched around and continue to have the same meaning.</li>
<li><code>[2]</code> The second sentence cannot be switched around and have the same meaning:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[2a] I am tall, **so** I am good at sports. 
[2b] I am good at sports, **so** I am tall.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>With <strong>and</strong>, you're simply stating the two facts and that they're both true.</li>
<li><p>With <strong>so</strong>, you're indicating that one of them is a reason for the other. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>[2a]</code> The <em>reason</em> why you're good at sports is that you're tall. </li>
<li><code>[2b]</code> The fact that you're good at sports is some kind of <em>evidence</em> that you must be tall.</li>
<li><code>[2b]</code> is a bad argument, but it <em>is</em> an argument.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Argument markers</strong> are words that mark or indicate the presence of an argument.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion markers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>so</em>, <em>therefore</em>, <em>thus</em>, <em>accordingly</em></li>
<li>The sentence after them is a <em>conclusion</em>.</li>
<li>The other sentence is a premise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reason or premise markers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>because</em>, <em>for</em>, <em>as</em>, <em>for the reason that</em>, <em>and the reason why</em>, <em>since</em></li>
<li>The sentence after them is a <em>reason</em> or a <em>premise</em>.</li>
<li>The other sentence is the conclusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conclusion markers and reason markers indicate that an argument is present, but only in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't just look at the word and figure out whether it's an argument marker or not. Think about its <strong>role</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, you can't just look for the word <strong>since</strong> and always mark it as an argument marker.</li>
<li>Think about what the word <strong>since</strong> is doing in that <strong>context</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
[3] I am good at sports **since** I am tall.
[4] The Sun has been up **since** seven o'clock this morning.
[5] It's been raining **since** my vacation began.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><code>[3]</code> <em>since</em> <strong>is</strong> a reason marker - you're presenting the fact that you're tall as a reason why you're good at sports.</li>
<li><code>[4]</code> <em>since</em> <strong>is not</strong> a reason marker - it doesn't indicate any kind of rational relation, only a temporal one.</li>
<li><p><code>[5]</code> You're <strong>not</strong> saying "It has been raining <strong>because</strong> my vacation began." Another temporal relation.</p></li>
<li><p>The same holds true for conclusion markers - they can indicate something entirely different.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre>
[6] You don't need to eat **so** much. 
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>[6]</code> <em>So</em> doesn't indicate that <em>much</em> is a reason for anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a particular word is being used as an argument marker or not:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre>
[7a] The liberal party has been dropping in the polls **since** the conservative party held their convention.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>They <em>might</em> be saying something like:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[7b] The liberal party has been dropping in the polls **at all times after** the conservative party held their convention.
[7c] The liberal party has been dropping in the polls **because** the conservative party held their convention.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p>How can you tell whether this person is claiming</p>
<ul>
<li>simply a temporal progression or</li>
<li>some kind of reason for the drop in the polls?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>One trick that is very useful is to try to <strong>substitute</strong> a different word.</p></li>
<li>If their claim means the same if they had used <em>because</em>, then you're claiming there's a <strong>rational relation</strong>.</li>
<li>If you can't substitute <em>because</em> for <em>since</em>, then the word <em>since</em> is not being used as an argument marker. </li>
<li><p>Sometimes that's just not going to be clear. Many people speak very loosely.</p></li>
<li><p>A good test is whether you can substitute another argument marker for the term that's unclear.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can, than that shows that the word, in this context, is being used to show that</p>
<ul>
<li>Something is a premise that gives a reason for something else, which is the conclusion.</li>
<li>That there's an argument being given in that passage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>if</strong> is sometimes linked with the word <strong>then</strong> in an <strong>if then clause</strong>, also known as a <strong>conditional</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If</strong> might seem like an argument marker because it's often used in arguments.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre>
[8a] **If** I am rich enough, **then** I can buy a baseball team.
[8b] I am rich enough. **So**, I can buy a baseball team.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Together, <code>[8a]</code> and <code>[8b]</code> present an argument.</li>
<li><p><code>[8a]</code> by itself, however, is <strong>not</strong> an argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not saying that I am rich enough...</li>
<li>... And it's not saying that I can buy a baseball team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The word if by itself does not indicate an argument. It sets a pattern for an argument.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre>
[9a] if (ANTECEDENT) then (CONDITION)
[9b] (the one thing) therefore (the other)
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>[9a]</code> <strong>is not</strong> an argument. <code>[9a]</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>[9b]</code> <strong>is</strong> an argument.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>if</strong> is not an argument marker even though it is important for some arguments.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_2-2:_Standard_Form">Lecture 2-2: Standard Form</span></h2>

[1b] I teach classes because I am a professor.
[1c] I teach classes, so I am a professor.

<ul>
<li>The premises are <em>intended</em> to be reasons for the conclusion. 

<ul>
<li>Intentions are nice, but success is better!</li>
<li>What we need to figure out is when the person <em>succeeds</em> in giving premises that really are reasons for the conclusion. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
(1) There is at least one bacterium on Mars.

</pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the premises justify you in believing the conclusion? </p>
<ul>
<li>If the premise is true, the conclusion has got to be true.</li>
<li>If you are justified in believing the premise, then you are also justified in believing the conclusion.</li>
<li>If there's no reason to believe the premise, then you're not justified in believing that premise.</li>
<li>If you're not justified in believing the premise, then how can that premise make you justified in believing the conclusion? </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>An argument cannot justify you in believing that the conclusion is true unless you are justified in believing that the premises are true. </p></li>
<li><p>In order for the premises to be justified, they have to be backed up by an argument.</p>

<li>But the argument has premises of its own that have to be backed up by another argument. And so on:</li>

<li><p>This is known as <strong>The Problem of the Skeptical Regress</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You regress back to one argument after another after enough and this regress might never end.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There seems to be only three ways to get around the problem of the skeptical regress.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a premise that is unjustified, which doesn't need an argument to back it up.</li>
<li>Use an argument with a circular structure, where claim 1 =&gt; claim 2 =&gt; ... =&gt; claim 1.</li>
<li>Use an infinite chain of arguments - every claim has an argument to back it up.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>With unjustified premises, you could make up, and prove, anything, even things which are obviously false.</li>
<li>With circular arguments, you could also prove anything. Consider the smallest circle (claim 1 =&gt; claim 1) below.

<ul>
<li>If you didn't know whether there was life on Mars to begin with, you wouldn't know whether the premise was true.</li>
<li>If you don't know the conclusion, you can't know the premise, since the premise <em>is</em> the conclusion.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
(1) There's life on Mars.
---------------------------
∴ (2) There's life on Mars.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>An infinite chain of arguments would allow you to prove there's life on Mars.

<ul>
<li>If the premise has no independent justification, then neither will the infinite chain:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>

There are at least three bacteria on Mars.
------------------------------------------
∴ There are at least two bacteria on Mars.

∴ There's a least one bacterium on Mars.

∴ There's life on Mars.

<ul>
<li><p>If these three possible solutions don't work, then it's hard to see how one would get around <em>skeptical regress</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's hard to see how any kind of argument could ever justify us in believing anything.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are various tricks for dealing with the skeptical regress problem.</p></li>
<li><p>One trick is to start from assumptions that everybody shares.</p>
<ul>
<li>One such assumption would be that you want a car that is <em>reliable</em>.</li>
<li>If you want reliability, and I want reliability, that's a reason to buy a car that is reliable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But, how do you know that a particular make of car is reliable?</p>
<ol>
<li>Assure the audience or appeal to an authority ("Consumer Reports has done a study...").</li>
<li>Discount or respond to possible objections ("Maybe Consumer Reports has been wrong sometimes, but this time...").</li>
<li>Guard your claim ("Consumer Reports might be, or are probably, right...")</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Find shared assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assumptions about the <strong>premises</strong> of your arguments. </li>
<li>Assumptions about <strong>authorities</strong> that supposedly support your premises.</li>
<li>Assumptions that you share with your audience in order to get the argument going.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Finding shared assumptions can be tricky, because it all depends on the context.</p>
<ul>
<li>With an audience that shares a lot of your assumptions, arguments will be relatively easy.</li>
<li>With an audience that doesn't share any of your assumptions, arguments will be impossible.</li>
<li>Lots of disagreement will cause your premises to be questioned, denied, or rejected by the audience.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<pre>
I assure you that smoking is bad for your health.

<ul>

<li>I might have some <em>reason</em> for believing that, but I don't say it.</li>
<li>I'm trying to get you to accept my premise without actually citing evidence.</li>
<li>Other examples: <em>It's obvious</em>, <em>Everybody knows</em>, <em>Certainly</em>, <em>Clearly</em>.</li>
<li>If a reason is not actually given, then that reason cannot be questioned.</li>
<li><p>If I don't give the reason, I've cut off your attack on the reason that I would give.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authoritative assurances</strong> cite an authority.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The <em>surgeon general</em> has shown that smoking is bad for your health."</li>
<li>Works only if the audience shares the assumption that the authority is trustworthy.</li>
<li>Even the best authorities sometimes do studies that aren't very careful and might even be wrong.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflexive assurances</strong> talks about yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I believe that</em>, <em>I know that</em>, <em>I am certain that</em>, <em>I feel sure that</em>.</li>
<li>People don't want to question what other people <em>feel</em> sure about. It's often impolite.</li>
<li><em>Thought about it for years</em> or <em>under careful consideration</em> doesn't make it right.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Abusive assurances</strong> are a little more subtle.</p>
<ul>
<li>The arguer gets you to accept what he believes by abusing you.</li>
<li>If you deny the argument, you're saying you lack common sense. Or are a dummy.</li>
<li><em>Nobody but a fool would think that</em>, <em>Everybody knows</em>, <em>You'd have to be stupid</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>appeal to common sense</strong>: <em>It's just common sense that...</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>These types of assurances are all used on common speech to stop the skeptical regress problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do we need any of these assurances in the first place?</p>
<ul>
<li>We've got limited time. You can't check every study, issue, or authorities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Benefits of assurances:</p>
<ol>
<li>They save you time.</li>
<li>They help you avoid the skeptic regress.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Tricks with assurances:</p>
<ol>
<li>Citations of untrustworthy authorities.</li>
<li>Distractions (<em>That's obvious</em>, <em>It's certain</em>, <em>I'm sure</em>)</li>
<li>Dropping assurances (<em>He says</em> =&gt; <em>It is reported</em> =&gt; <em>Sources have said</em> =&gt; <em>There are</em> ...)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We want an assurance when:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone might question the claim.</li>
<li>The audience accepts the authority.</li>
<li>It would be too much trouble to cite all of the evidence.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Assurances are not appropriate when:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one would question the claim anyway.</li>
<li>The authority is not trustworthy.</li>
<li>You are easily able to give the full explanation.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>The objector would never have used the unguarded term <em>all</em> but <em>most</em> or <em>many</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Think about the objections that the arguer is <strong>not</strong> considering.</p></li>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_2-7:_Evaluation">Lecture 2-7: Evaluation</span></h2>
<pre>
You ought to support my healthcare plan because it would be good for the country.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>What is the word <em>good</em> doing here?

<ul>
<li>Some will say it's just a way of expressing your emotions.</li>
<li>So, the politician is saying "Yay!" for his health care plan.</li>
<li>But "Yay, Duke!" is cheering for the team even if they're <em>not good</em>.</li>
<li>And it doesn't make any sense to say "But, why?" in response to "Yay, Duke!"</li>
<li>"Yay for my health care plan" is very different than saying it's a good plan.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
I don't like fish, so we shouldn't have fish for dinner.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Not liking fish doesn't really require a <em>reason</em> behind not liking it.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It's immoral / It's wrong / You ought not to eat fish</em> is a different story.</li>
<li>The speaker now needs to explain what's immoral about eating fish.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Expressing Preferences ≠ Making An Evaluation.</p></li>
<li><p>One way of to capture this feature of evaluative language is to interpret as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Good</em> -&gt; meets the standards; <em>Bad</em> -&gt; violates the standards.</li>
<li>The standards of a good painting are different than those of a good investment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The trick is, when we call something <em>good</em>, we don't specify what the standards are.</p>
<ul>
<li>We leave that up to the context to specify what kind of standards.</li>
<li>It's like <em>assuring</em> - you have some reason, but you don't specify the reason.</li>
<li>The claim is more defensible: standards can't be questioned if they're not presented.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
We ought to turn left here.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p>We don't have to agree on what the standards are.</p>
<ul>
<li>#1: "turn left here" because it's a quicker way to our destination.</li>
<li>#2: "turn left here" because it's a more beautiful and scenic view.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Less objections if people can apply their own standards to the meaning of <em>good</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation is another way to avoid the skeptic regress.</p></li>
<li><p>Different levels of evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>General: <em>Good or Bad</em>, <em>Ought or Ought Not</em>, <em>Should or Should Not</em>, <em>Right or Wrong</em>.</li>
<li>Specific: <em>Beautiful or Ugly</em>, <em>Cruel or Kind</em>, <em>Brave or Cowardly</em>, <em>Comfortable or Uncomfortable</em>.</li>
<li>Defining a more specific evaluative word often requires using general evaluative words.</li>
<li>A <em>bargain</em> is something with a <em>good price</em> and a good price is a <em>low price</em>.</li>
<li>What makes these words evaluative is their connection to what is good or bad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Contextually evaluative</em> words are not defined by <em>good</em> are <em>bad</em>...</p>
<ul>
<li>...and are only evaluative in certain contexts.</li>
<li>A conservative politician might criticize her opponent by saying:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre>
His policies are too liberal.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><p>She intends <em>liberal</em> as a criticism, but the word itself isn't <em>bad</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The opponent might say "Yes, it's liberal. I'm proud to be a liberal!"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We will call language "evaluative" only when it is openly and literally evaluative.</p>
<ul>
<li>It gets defined in words like <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em>, and not when it's merely contextually evaluative.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Combining positive and negative evaluative words can be tricky:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Good</em> means <em>good</em>. But <em>pretty good</em> is not as good as <em>good</em>.</li>
<li>And adding a negative, <em>pretty darn good</em>, means it's <em>very good</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Another tricky word is "too":</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This food is spicy</em> is <em>good</em>.</li>
<li><em>This food is too spicy</em> is <em>bad</em>.</li>
<li>Too is a negative evaluative word because it makes a positive or neutral word become bad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Slanting</strong> is using evaluative terms without having reasons for doing so.</p>
<ul>
<li>People typically slant when they don't have any reason for their evaluation.</li>
<li>Good indication that that's where their argument is probably weak.</li>
</ul></li>
