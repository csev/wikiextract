</ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Security_Mindset">Security Mindset</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Look for ways that things can go wrong</li>
<li>Adversary = criminal, bad guy</li>
<li>Adversarial failures = adversary successfully sabatoging something</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Think like an attacker</strong>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li> Understand how to circumvent security
</li><li> How can the system break?
</li><li> What is the weakest link? easist to attack?
</li><li> Identify false assumptions
</li><li> Think outside the box of system designer</p>
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p><strong>Think like a defender</strong><br />
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li> security policy 
</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li> What is being protected?
</li><li> What properties are being enforced?</p>
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p><strong>Threat model</strong>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li> Who are the attackers? capabilities? motives?
</li><li> What kind of attack?</p>
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>

<p><strong>Countermeasures</strong>
<ul><li> Costs vs. benefits
</li><li> Technical vs. nontechnical</p>
</li></ul>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ssecurity_requirements_for_voting">Ssecurity requirements for voting</span></h4>
<p><strong>1. Integrity</strong>
<ul><li> Outcome is the same as voter intent
</li><li> Votes are cast as intended
</li><li> Votes are counted as cast</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>2. Ballot secrecy</strong>
<ul><li> Weak: no one can figure out how a person voted
</li><li> Strong: no one can reveal how he/she voted → prevent vote buying, coercion</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>3. Voter authentication</strong>
<ul><li> Only authorized voters vote
</li><li> Each voter can only vote once</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>4. Voter enfranchisement</strong>
<ul><li> All authorized voters have the opportunity to vote</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>5. Availability</strong>
<ul><li> Election system is able to accept all votes and produce results in a timely manner</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Other concerns</strong>
<ul><li> cost effectiveness
</li><li> availability
</li><li> convenience
</li><li> intelligibility</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Noteworthy for decision-making:</strong>
<em>Tensions exist between some security requirements such as between Integrity and Ballot Secrecy, Voter authentication and enfranchisement.</em>
<em>These tensions require trade-offs which ultimately result in what security/technology to embark on to protect ballots.</em></p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="It_is_believed_these_trade-offs_are_the_underlying_considerations_for_whatever_technologies_have_been_used_at_different_times_in_voting_history."><em>It is believed these trade-offs are the underlying considerations for whatever technologies have been used at different times in voting history.</em></span></h2>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_We_Got_Here">How We Got Here</span></h2>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Living_Voice">The Living Voice</span></h4>
<p>Voice Voting:<br />
<em>viva voce</em> = living voice in Latin</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong><br />
<ul><li> Voter walks up to polling place<br />
</li><li> Election judge swears in voter on the Bible<br />
</li><li> Voter calls out his name loudly → authorization<br />
</li><li> Voter calls out candidate he is voting for<br />
</li><li> Clerks write down voters name and vote<br />
</li><li> Observers could also record votes as they are called out  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Problems:</strong><br />
<ul><li> No ballot secrecy<br />
</li><li> Candidate could be within listening distance of vote<br />
</li><li> Voter intimidation/coercion possible<br />
</li><li> Vote buying possible  </p>
</li></ul>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_Paper_Ballots">Early Paper Ballots</span></h4>
<p>Replaced voice voting<br />
France &amp; England wrote ballot voting into constitution and charters<br />
Earliest known use in ancient Greece (used balls, tokens)<br />
Ballot boxes were usually locked<br />
Voters put paper ballot in slot on box<br />
Officials counted votes publicly; if counting later, might seal the box  </p>
<p><strong>Security Mechanisms during counting:</strong>
Reader of ballot does not have a writing implement<br />
Observers from different parties, levels of government</p>
<p><strong>Security Issues:</strong>
<ul><li> Procedural: if not followed precisely could exclude the observers in the back
</li><li> Readers could announce any name
</li><li> Ballot boxes could be rigged – false botton and false side
</li><li> Glass boxes were introduced to prevent this
</li><li> Faulty lock</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Acme voting machine
    1st machine – had gears, crank
    Voter inserted ballot, turned crank → bell to signal vote entered, counter protected against box stuffing, same # of ballots as votes</p>
<p>Cardboard ballot box:
    disposable</p>
<p>Metal ballot box:
    more secure than cardboard
    metal tab for attaching padlocks</p>
<p><strong>Design of Ballots:</strong>
<ul><li> Early ballots → voter wrote in names
</li><li> Would be easier for voters to have names already on ballots
</li><li> Some had one name printed &amp; room for other names to be written in
</li><li> Possible for voters to write in the spaces between listed names
</li><li> Party tickets
</li><li> Nonstandard designs → voter confusion</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Security Issues:</strong><br />
Multiple voting<br />
<ul><li> Multiple ballots printed on same ticket<br />
</li><li> Voter responsible for tearing them off<br />
</li><li> Different colors used for different party tickets<br />
</li><li> Weak protections  </p>
</li></ul>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Australian_Ballot">The Australian Ballot</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Pre-printed ballot → uniformity</li>
<li>Provided by the government, not the voter or parties</li>
<li>Voting booth → secrecy</li>
<li><p>Voter registration  </p></li>
<li><p>Additional costs
<dl><dd><ul><li><ul><li> Had to decide in advance who goes on the ballot<br />
</li><li> Printing ballots
</li><li> More advanced preparation<br />
</li><li> Storage of booths between elections<br />
</li><li> Additional complexity: advanced planning, printing  </p></li>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Issues:</strong><br />
<ul><li> Counting bosses and political corruption: Boss Tweed &amp; Tamany Hall
</li><li> Counters made extra marks on ballots with hidden pencil/lead (short pencil artist)
</li><li> Marks could also be erased
</li><li> Extraneous marks would disqualify a vote (identifying marks/names/multiple votes) </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Chain Voting:</strong><br />
<ul><li> Person waits outside polling place and says he wants to buy ballots
</li><li> Has a pre-filled out ballot
</li><li> Voter takes the ballot to the voting booth
</li><li> Voter picks a new ballot &amp; goes to booth with it
</li><li> Puts pre-filled out ballot in box &amp; gives blank ballot to criminal
</li><li> Criminal uses blank ballot with another person
</li><li>Could prevent using a detachable serial number on ballot to make sure voter returns the same ballot</p>
</li></ul>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanical_Voting_Machines">Mechanical Voting Machines</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Industrial Revolution influenced invention of mechanical voting machines – late 1800s-early 1900s</li>
<li>Claims: complete secrecy, tamper proof</li>
<li>Mechanism to prevent multiple voting</li>
<li>Inside machine, locked: counter mechanism to count votes as they were cast</li>
<li>Could vote for individual candidates or a party</li>
<li>Lever to close &amp; open the curtain; lever would cast the votes and clear the board</li>
<li>Was in view of an official to ensure correct procedure done</li>
<li>Eliminated most of the problems of voice voting, paper ballots, chain voting, etc</li>
<li>Security issues:<br />
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li><ul><li> No record that voter voted; nothing for voter to see
</li><li> Mechanical failure due to multiple parts, gears, etc
</li><li> Counter could stop incrementing if tab broke off
</li><li> Sabotage to machine → difficult to distinguish if mechanical or sabatoge
</li><li> Fraud: jam pencil lead into gears  </li>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Punched_Card_Voting:">Punched Card Voting:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Holes punched out of a card with a stylus and read by a computer</li>
<li>Nothing printed on cards → secrecy</li>
<li>Security issues:
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li><ul><li> No good way for the voter to see the vote being counted correctly
</li><li> Easy to misalign cards
</li><li> Florida 2000 presidential election: some voters voted for 2 candidates
</li><li> Votes were discounted
</li><li> Chad (paper punched out): can cause many problems
</li><li> Can block another hole being punched
</li><li> Holes might not be punched all the way
</li><li> Could be maliciously tampered with during counting
</li><li> Punch cards are no longer used → computer voting systems introduced</li>
