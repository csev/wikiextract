3.3 Diversity of Student Sources: An analysis of secondary schools <br />
As of 2002, there have been over 7,000 secondary schools that have provided students to Suzhou University. As of 1999, there have been over 6,000 secondary schools that have provided students to Peking University. However, the secondary schools that have sent students to these two universities amount to only a small fraction of the massive number of secondary schools in China. At the same time, a small minority of secondary schools send the majority of students to these two universities, and the vast majority of these schools have only sent one student over a period of 50 years. Having such a high degree of concentration of student sources is a common characteristic of both of these universities. <br /> <br />
Table 2 illustrates the source secondary schools for both universities and the ratio of students they send. The data from Peking University shows that, since 1949, 7.39% of Peking University undergraduates have come from the top 5 secondary schools, and these five secondary schools only represent 0.08% of all the secondary schools that have sent students to PKU. The top 3.08% of source secondary schools (200 schools) have provided 41.1% of all PKU students. The top 5% of secondary schools have provided 50%, and the top 20% of secondary schools have provided close to 80% of all PKU students. Out of all of the approximately 6,500 source secondary schools, there exists a great difference between each secondary school's ability to send students to PKU as well the number of students that each school actually sent to PKU. Suzhou University's situation is similar. <br /></p>
