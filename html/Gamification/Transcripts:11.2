					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>One criticism of gamification is that it's ineffective because it only uses the surface mechanics and other elements from games and thus, should be called pointification. A second criticism is that gamification is potentially too effective that it can be used to get people to do things that aren't necessarily in their interest. And that criticism goes by the name of exploitationware. I've already shown you some examples in this vein and the concept of play board or coerced play. For example, the leader board for the housekeeping staff at some of the Disneyland hotels, where the employees felt like the gamification techniques were not encouraging and motivating them. In fact, they were controlling them and forcing them to compete more aggressively just to keep up. That's an example of gamification being used in a way that potentially is exploitative as opposed to supportive of the employees. The term exploitationware was coined by Ian Boogost, who's a noted game designer and researcher at Georgia Tech University, in a post that appeared on on his personal blog and also on the game industry blog Gamasutra, Here's the URL to the personal blog version of it. And, he essentially made two arguments. One was that gamification if, people like, like Margaret Robertson say, it's an inadvertent con, it's accidentally misleading people about the nature of games. Bogost says, no, actually, it's an intentional con. Gamification is a way to try to make people think that their job doesn't suck, even when it does. So gamification, he says, is inherently a technique that can be used as a way to confuse people and to make them ignore the real conditions of their workplace as opposed to focusing on the actual compensation and meaningfulness and rewarding aspects of the job. The broader point though that Bogost makes in calling gamification exploitationware is that it fundamentally undermines the nature of economic and social exchange between workers and their employers. In his argumenent goes like this. He says, gamifificaiton proposes to replace real incentives with fictational ones. So in other words, if the idea is we can motivate people with shiny badges and points, and all of these virtual techniques that lead to no tangible material rewards, then companies will start do do that instead of rewarding and incentivizing their employees with things like money, or better working conditions, or more job responsibility. And his argument is that essentially, this undermines the bargain between both sides, because the workers are still giving up their effort and their productivity, but what they're getting in return is something that is ultimately empty. Maybe for a little bit, they feel like it's something motivating, but really what the company is doing is again, an intentional con, is saying, instead of giving you something that we know is valuable to you and which is costly to us to give, we're going to give you something that we think of as virtually free to basically trick you into thinking that you're getting a reward that's meaningful. And so, that's the argument about exploitationware and it's one that is worth taking into account. Bogost does have a point and, in fact, there are examples we can see, including some of the ones that I've given you in the course, where gamification is not necessarily something that's done to make workers beter off. But here, as with many other examples of gamification, the real question is how are the tools being used? The same context can be used in exploitative ways or in ways that are healthy for workers. For example, in the call center space, there are examples of gamification that are about manipulation, that are about companies wanting to track, ever mor closely, what workers are doing in order to manage the min ways that don't help the workers at all. They treat them as commodities and that probably are not ultimately healthy for the companies themselves because they're so short term focused. And at the same time, there are examples in the call center world of gamification systems that encourage people as call center operators, to learn and to fell more engagement and more meaning in their work. So, the problem, i think, is not gamification, per se, the problem is use of gamification, either inadvertently without an awareness that there can be a divergence between the players interest and at least a short term version of the system designers interest. Or deliberately as a trick, as a shortcut to force people to do something. Tis is something that's dangerous, that's harmful. And that gamification designers need to be careful to avoid. But it's something that can happen easily if you're not careful. Bogost, himself designed a wonderful proof of the ease of reaching this conclusion with something he created called Cow Clicker. And the Cow Clicker was something that Bogost created on a lark. It was partly a way to make fun of social games like the Zynga games, that are so driven by virtual goods and virtual currency, and these appointment dynamics of trying ot get people to feel like they're crops are going to rot so they have to come back right away. And so, what Bogost did was he created something like one of these social games called Cow Clicker, that had no point whatsoever. The mechanic of the games was, you have to click on a cow. That's it. You click on a cow, you click on the cow again, you click on the cow again. But, there are all different kinds of cows. The cows are virtual goods. So, there are some cows that are more rare. There are some cows that you unlock by clicking a lot, or clicking at certain times. And the game is designed to show at least to Bogost, the fundamental emptiness of these kinds of systems that rely purely on these engagement loops. And it turns out what happened was 500,000 people started playing this game, which again, had no point whatsoever than to show how silly this idea was. People were actually doing it, people where clicking on the cows time and time and time again. And ultimately there were people topping the leaderboard with vast amounts of the games virtual currency which could be accumulated if they had clicked hundreds of thousands of times on these cows. So clearly, people do surprising things. Things that, may at first glance make no sense, if they are drawn in by these kinds of habit forming engagement based system. That's part of what can make them useful, but it is also what makes them dangerous. So in designing gamification, the first step in the process, the first step in the gamification design framework that I gave you, is to focus on the business objectives. What's the purpose here? What's the purpose of encouraging people to take some action? How does it really tie to a deep important business or other goal? And the second thing is who are the players. It's critical to focus on the people who were involved in the game and not treat them just as automatons that are forced or suckered into participating in, in this activity, which doesn't really benefit them. So, exploitation are like pointisifaction are legitimate criticism, is one that's successful and thoughtful gamification designers need to take into account and is one that should be part of your thinking whenever you try to understand how to apply these techniques that I've talked about to a problem that you've defined.
