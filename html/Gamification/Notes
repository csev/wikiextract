<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_gamification.3F">What is gamification?</span></h2>
<code><pre> The use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts.
</pre></code>
<p>No point in gamifying unless it is effective.</p>
<p>Gamification is great for motivation - fun is powerful</p>
<p>Practical categories:
<ul><li>External (for example, consumer engagement)
</li><li>Internal (for example, office incentives)
</li><li>Behavior change (for example, fitocracy.com)
</li><li>Can you think of others?</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Gamification is also about 'normalising' new attitudinal values and behaviors, like MiniMonos does in enabling kids to be environmentalists when playing their game. </p>
<p>A definition by Michael Wu, Ph.D.:</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, gamification is the use of game mechanics to drive game-like engagement and actions. The logic is dead simple. People love to play games. But in everyday life, we are often presented with activities we hate, whether it is boring chores or stressful works. Gamification is the process of introducing game mechanics into these abhorred activities to make them more game-like (i.e. fun, rewarding, desirable, etc.), so that people would want to proactively take part in these tasks.</p>

<code><pre> pre-lusory goal, constitutive rules, lusory attitude

 &quot;voluntary overcoming of unnecesary obstacles&quot;

 &quot;A game is a series of meaningful choices&quot;
</pre></code>
<p>Some examples of game elements:
<ul><li>Points
</li><li>Resources
</li><li>Levels
</li><li>Quests
</li><li>Avatars
</li><li>Social graph (a graph of relationships with other users, for example, friends on Facebook)
</li><li>Leader board</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Some examples of successful game "categories":
<ul><li>Sandbox - Minecraft
</li><li>Building - SimCity, Civilization series
</li><li>Social Building = Sims, Farmville
</li><li>MMO's - World of Warcraft
</li><li>Puzzle - Portal, Angry Birds</p>

</ul>
<p>Very interesting work being done to empower learners to create their own "learning record store." Not a huge leap to see how this might feed into a gamified "eduquest" and result in parsable (vetted?) badging or progession points equating to degree requirement satisfaction.</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Games_and_Play">Games and Play</span></h3>
<p>Roger Callois suggested the dichotomy of 
    Paidia (play)&lt;-----&gt; Ludus (game)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Play is the aimless expenditure of exuberant energy." - Friedrich Schiller</li>
<li>"Play is whatever is done spontaneously and for its own sake." - George Santayana</li>
<li>"Play creates a zone of proximal development of the child. In play a child always behaves beyond his average age." - Lev Vygotsky</li>
<li><p>"Play is a free movement within a more rigid structure." - Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman</p></li>
<li><p>"A game is a closed, formal system that engages players in a structured conflict and resolves in an unequal outcome." - Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, Steven Hoffman</p></li>
<li>"A game is a series of meaningful choices" - Sid Meier</li>
<li>"A game is a domain of contrived contingency that generates interpretable outcomes." - Thomas Mallaby</li>
<li>"A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude." - Jesse Schell</li>
</ul>
<p>In a game, there is freedom to go along different paths to the goal (from start to finish).</p>
<p>To connect philosophical view of games and other views:
<ul><li> emphasize voluntariness
</li><li> games have learning or problem solving
</li><li> game design is a balance of structure and exploration</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Video_Games">Video Games</span></h3>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_Gamify.3F">Why Gamify?</span></h3>
<p>Lessons from Dodgeball:
<ul><li> Early mobile app to check in and see if friends were nearby
</li><li> Chicken-egg problem: if no one was checked in nearby, it wasn't very interesting to check in yourself (engagement gap).  Also, no sense of progression, wasn't that social, and didn't incent you to make it a habit.
</li><li> Bought by Google in 2005.
</li><li> Dodgeball founders Dennis Crowley and Alex Rainert left Google in 2007
</li><li> In 2009, Dennis Crowley started Foursquare with Naveen Selvadurai.<br />
</li><li> FourSquare: introduced Badges, status (mayor)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>[<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeball"><em>(service)</a>]
[<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare"></em>(social_networking)</a>]</p>
<p>Aspects of Dodgeball
<ul><li> Engagement gap - the more people use it, the bigger fun it is
</li><li> Choices - lack of variety (you check-in or don't)
</li><li> Progression - checking-in the hundreth time is like checking-in the first time
</li><li> Social - Dodgeball involved relationships with friends
</li><li> Habit - "If you have to think each time: 'Oh, I better get out my phone and go and check-in,' you're not going to do it all that much."</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Thinking_Like_a_Game_Designer">Thinking Like a Game Designer</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Tell yourself: I AM a game designer, which is distinct from being a game designer (req. training) and from being a gamer</li>
<li>Think of participants as PLAYERS (customers, community, employees, target population). Players PLAY (they are the center of the game, have autonomy, meaningful choices with consequences)</li>
<li>Goal: get them and keep them playing</li>
<li>about the state of mind</li>
<li>as game designer, you think about components, instead of thinking like a gamer</li>
<li>paying attention to the structure and the framework, not the experience</li>
<li>think about the people involved as “players”
 players are the center of the game
 players feel a sense of autonomy
 players play</li>
<li>the relationship is between the designer and the player</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Design_rules">Design rules</span></h3>
<p>Player journey:
<ul><li> Onboarding: getting a player to play; getting the player into the game as quickly as possible
</li><li> Scaffolding: keeping the player playing; provides the training, helps the player overcome some of the obstacles which might otherwise get the player stuck; an introductory task (how to do something, a deep learning process)
</li><li> Pathways to mastery (acquired and achieved a real skill)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Plants v. Zombies level one:
<ul><li> Guides: here's what you should do
</li><li> Highlighting: focus on an area for guidance
</li><li> Feedback: get a reward, defeat an enemy
</li><li> Limited options: dumb-downed
</li><li> Limited zombies: one zombie
</li><li> Pretty darn hard to fail (rewards you with level completion)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The importance of Balance: not too, hard, easy, overwhelming, underwhelming
<ul><li> if it's too uneven for participants, then it's not fun
</li><li> this is very tricky</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Create an experience
<ul><li> Example of music site that created a club atmosphere, with DJs, and music rating system</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Psychology_and_Motivation_.28I.29_-_Concepts_of_Gamification">Psychology and Motivation (I) - Concepts of Gamification</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Motivational_Design">Motivational Design</span></h3>
<p>Example: In 2011 MLB introduced these player badges for every time you finish watching a video on their web site.  What's the point?
Dodgers fan club was interested in them, they were not intended but later became obsessed with these badges (reminiscent of baseball cards)
There is no answer to motivation; it's complicated because people are complicated.  </p>
<p>Example: Apple Inc's retail store experience: they wanted you to linger, hang out, and browse, because purchasing a computer is a lifestyle change.  </p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviorism">Behaviorism</span></h3>
<p>Behaviorism: externally what people are doing on the outside (i.e. emotions, feelings, consciousness)
Classical conditioning: stimulus entails a response
<ul><li> Example: Pavlov's dog and the bell for food
</li></ul>
Operant conditioning: stimulus and response go in a feedback loop until the person learns (sees the consequences and becomes aware)
<ul><li> Example: BF Skinners boxes</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Behavioral Economics: let's look at what people do (vs why)
<ul><li> Example: person walks on the street and sees $100 what do they do?</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Learning from behaviorism:
<ul><li> Observation
</li><li> Feedback loop
</li><li> Reinforcement</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviorism_and_Gamification">Behaviorism and Gamification</span></h3>
<p>Conditioning through consequences:
<ul><li> Example: Zynga Farmville had crops and they wither if not taken care of, so there was an appointment mechanic (people drawn to check in)
</li></ul>
Reinforcement through rewards:
<ul><li> The dopamine system deals with pleasure and learning, more associated with the activity of getting the reward than the reward itself.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reward_structures">Reward structures</span></h3>
<p>What can be incentivized? Give player meaningful choices.
Cognitive evaluation theory: What kind of rewards are there?

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_of_behaviourism">Limits of behaviourism</span></h3>
<p>Behaviourism describes what people do in certain circumstances (for example, they like lotteries). This is limited: it does not make us understand WHY they like lotteries. Clearly there is something to be said about that, but that is out of the scope of behaviourism. For gamification the behaviourist approach can be limited: the gamer should be central in thinking about gamification, but behaviourism considers the gamer as a black box.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dangers_of_behaviourism">Dangers of behaviourism</span></h3>
<p>Problems:
<ul><li>Manipulation. May be problematic to get a player addicted in order to achieve goal that is not in his/her best interest (eg. slot machines).
</li><li>Hedonic treadmill. When people get used to rewards, the consequetive lack of rewards may lower motivations. Tied into the dopamine reward system in the brain. If you figure out what the reward system is, the game becomes less interesting (because rewards are expected).  Remember the example of the monkey--when the tone was played before the spray of grape juice (the reward), the monkeys' dopamine response came with the tone, not the actual grape juice.
</li><li>Overemphasis on status. Not everyone is motivated by status all the time.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Extrinsic_and_intrinsic_motivation">Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</span></h3>
<p>Cognitivism: "opening the black box" (as opposed to behaviourism).
Intrinsic rewards: do stuff for its own sake
Extrinsic rewards: do stuff for other reasons than the thing itself
SAPS framework: 4 kinds of extrinsic rewards:
<ul><li>Status
</li><li>Access. Special access to something new (moderaters only, unlocking new content).
</li><li>Power
</li><li>Stuff
</li></ul>
Badges can be both intrinsically and extrinsically motivating</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_rewards_demotivate">How rewards demotivate</span></h3>
<p>Over-justification: Extrinsic rewards may lead a gamer to think that it's all about the rewards, making him 'forget' his initial intrinsic motivation. 
Examples: 
<ul><li>drawing: studies have shown that when kids are told to draw a picture without a reward being mentioned, they do fine and work hard on their drawing. However, when you tell them that they will get a prize for drawing a picture, they don't work as hard on it.
</li><li>day care centre pickup: When a day-care enacted a fine for parents picking their kids up late, the number of late parents increased. This was because the guilt of picking their kids up late was replaced with a feeling of justification because they had paid for the privilege of picking them up late. [Note: The book Freakonomics discusses this in great length.]
</li><li>blood donation, teacher salaries
</li></ul>
Over-justification effects occur for tasks that were interesting enough to begin with (i.e. people were already intrinsically motivated). 
Over-justification occurs more often when the rewards were tangible. Less for unexpected awards. Performance-contingent rewards can go both ways: if the reward is only informational, then no problem; if the reward is desirable, a real reward, then the problem may occur. </p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Self-determination_theory">Self-determination theory</span></h3>
<p>Amotivation (not motivated) vs intrinsic motivation (= strongest form of motivation)
External regulation: the only thing that makes you do it, is that you have to. 
Interjection: Make external motivators our own. Status: I don't care personally, but I care about the status.
Identification: I can personally see some value in it. Aligned with personal goals, but don't really want to.
Integration: I really want to do it. But not for the thing itself.
Self-determination: 3 characteristics
<ul><li>Competence: to do with ability (to achieve a successful outcome).
</li><li>Autonomy: person is in control. Example: fitness site, player may choose desired workout areas.
</li><li>Relatedness: activity is related to yourself</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Pointsification">Pointsification</span></h3>
<p>Criticism: Gamification focuses on PBL’s, which are the least essential to games. 
Can be addressed by thinking about gamification more broadly. Critiques mostly the behavioral type of gamification (not all gamification works like that). 
Does it actually work? 
<ul><li> Real research on effectiveness is limited. 
</li><li> Potential for engagement decay (if behavioral type of gamification is used).
</li><li> Crowding out (ie over-justification).
</li></ul>
Implications
<ul><li> Names are powerful: gamification refers to games.
</li><li> Bad gamification is bad. Especially behaviorist type. 
</li><li> There is more to games than gamification and vice versa.
</li><li> Caveat ludor. Be beware of difference between pointsification and gamification</p>

<p>** Note this is paraphrase from Lecture 8.5**</p>
<p><em>KW</em>: what you make of the certain gamification trend?</p>
<p><em>AJK</em>: it's a great wave of interest in gaming b/c same reasons (growing up, mechanics easy).  Word "gamification" will go away but will be a toolkit of various design.  It will be the wakening of a new trend.  </p>
<p><em>KW</em>: Richard Bartles' notion of player types, you have a slightly different perspective?</p>
<p><em>AJK</em>: Taking Bartles' structure and applying to all gamification is silly because it is a model of human behavior from multi-user dimensions (pre-cursor for WOW).  If you are building an MMO or player dynamics, you may use Bartle's model.  Sees different models in social media (here's Bartles player types, here's why they are not going to work, here's how to tweak them).  Bartles did not talk about <strong>self-expression</strong> (primary player type).  </p>
<p><strong>AJK's Social Engagement Verbs (2010)</strong>:
<ul><li> Express: build, create, choose, design
</li><li> Compete: win, challenge, showoff, compare
</li><li> Explore: view, collect, rate, vote, curate
</li><li> Collaborate: comment, like, greet, share, give</p>
</li></ul>

<p><em>KW</em>: What's the opportunity space for the collaborative space in games?</p>
<p><em>AJK</em>: Here's a quantifiable definition of GAME:</p>
<code><pre> GAME: a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, 
 that results in a quantifiable outcome* (Source: _Rules of Play_)
</pre></code>
<p>What we see is zero-sum game (I win, you lose).  Head-to-head battle, gambling, rank-ordered competitions, war simulations is just a finite pie.  Some of the loved games (Sims, Rockband) does not have a quantifiable outcome, so I see it as:</p>
<code><pre> GAME: a structured experience with rules and goals that's fun to play (Source: Engagement Design)
</pre></code>
<p>This was defining non-zero-sum games (we're not opponents but partners) such as training and drawing.  Playground games, martial arts, charity walk, and party games are all winning together.  </p>
<p><em>KW</em>: What's a particular mistake that people make when coming out of web design and social media into gamification?</p>
<p><em>AJK</em>:  Web design and social media understand funnels, engagement loops, and loyalty, but game experiences changes over time and key stages in a player's journey that gives the person powers and commitment.  What makes it sustainable is for the experience itself to evolve over time.  Use newbie, analytic, and expert (elder game).</p>

<p>URL: <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.work.com">Salesforce Work.com</a></i>
CEO of Ripple
Ripple is about feedback, social performance management
Not thinking about making it a game, but about design
If any game could be made successful by just slapping game mechanics on top of them, then it would be easy. But most games are not that successful. Gamification is used for amplifying behaviors that are already desired.
Q: How do you find things that are intrinsically rewarding.
A: look at the data. What do people do? People already give eachother compliments/ recognition by mail or directly. Also physical awards already existed. The meaning of the award is what counts.<br />
Also: Experiment. 
Q: What’s the fundamental difference between internal and external gamification? 
A: Understand context:
Incentivizing with cash rewards for signing up friends made people invite their friends less, rather than more. 
Depends on corporate culture to engage in frivolous behavior (badges, etc). People are conscious of their behavior.
Q: Can gamification work in more traditional companies.
A: Yes, for three reasons. Hip companies such as Facebook are quite traditional companies too. Many of our customers are traditional companies. Big companies have the same problem (performance management). Plus: it’s not like people don’t already play game at work. There are already many rewards at work (bigger office, car park, promotion). 
Q: How do you avoid negative cutthroat behavior?
A: Measure. People don’t always behave as you expect. Get game designers to help. Think of mechanics as amplification tools for desired behavior and choose those behaviors accordingly. </p>

Susan Hunt Stevens interview
Practically Green -&gt; Motivate healthier and sustainable behavior
Transparancy about norms
Game elements used for scale (as in: measure where they are).
Gamification was never planned, but it evolved. Game elements make it fun, which is new in this context. 
Games have a shelf life of 6-18 months. Think about how to drive long term engagement. Community is key: 80% is in it for the social environment. 
Much more effective if the community already exists, just make social norms transparent. Work communities get most engaged.
Q: How is feedback used to change behavior?
A: Level-up: beginners or advanced? Allows what information is useful / interesting for somebody. 
Q: how do you avoid overjustification?
A: There’s no currency / points. The more tangible the reward mechanism is, the more incentive there is to game the system. 
Q: will gamification become the norm in these areas?
A: One of the problems was is how to scale it.</p>
