<p>in our fourth video we're going to talk about pulmonary tests and alveolar ventilation which is the actual amount of fresh air that reaches the alveoli. So we're going to start off talking about pulmonary function tests which are going to be again important in. Diagnosing and tracking people that have lung diseases and one thing that can be measured is going to be, like we, very similar to what we learned before. It's going to be the, if you fill your lung as much as possible, how much air can you get out? So it's going to be total lung capacity minus the residual volume. Then we're also going to talk about forced expert, expiratory volume in one second. So this is going to be how much can you get out of your lung in one second. And so you can look at this ration of these Two things and in a normal individual, if you look at the ratio of how much air you can get out in 1 second versus how much air you can get out total, it should be that you can get out about 80% of your air. So that's a FEV1 versus FVC ratio of about 80%. In someone with obstructive lung disease, which we said are people who have problems getting the air out of their lungs, then they're going to have a reduced FEV1 and usually a normal FVC and so their ratio will be less than 80%. That's different from someone with a restrictive lung disease that should have no problems getting the air out. So FEV1 should be a normal proportion of FEVC, it's just that these numbers are going to probably be smaller because forced vital capacity, how much lung air they can take in is going to be much smaller, and so in that way the ratio will probably remain the same, but yet the absolute value of both numbers will be reduced. So this is a graph form of looking at this test, and we're going to concentrate on graph, curve y first. Because this would be a normal individual. You see right here they're breath, going along breathing normally and then the person who's administering the test says, okay, fill your lung completely. And so that what, that's what they do here and you can see they've Taken in about 3 and a half liters of air, and then they wait a second and then the person says okay, get out all your air, but as quickly as possible. And so they're going to exhale and in that first second they're going to have exhaled about 80% of their air, and then they'll continue throughout over the course of many seconds to completely get out the air. And so the amount of air that they're able to exhale from up here to down here, this is going to be their forced vital capacity. And then the amount that they can take out right here is going to be the FEV1. So it's going to be ratio of those two that's going to be about 80%. In someone with a obstructive lung disease, they can usually get in, take in the air, no problem. So here they're inhaling and they're taking in about that same three liters. You notice that it's at a higher volume. So they're operating at a higher volume, trying to keep that layer, that lung inflated even after exhalation to try to stop problems with resistance and since they have an obstructive lung disease then they do. Often have a problem with resistance. For instance, someone with asthma or chronic bronchitis. And so then, if they have all that resistance. They just can't get out the air very quickly. And so, after 1 second, they've only blown out or exhaled something like a third of their forced vital capacity. And so it takes much longer and it, it's um., to get a significant amount of air out of the lung with this obstructive lung disease. So that FEV1, FEV, FVC ratio will be much less than 80%. And then we have curve z which is going to be a restrictive lung disease where you can see, first of all they start at a lower volume, and then when they try to take that maximal inhalation It's less than two liters. However then once they try to exhale, since they've got that decreased compliance, but they've got that increased recoil, they have no problems getting the air out of the lung. But you can see how both volumes are going to be reduced. It's just the ratio will still very often be about 80%. So that's how these Pulmonary function tests are very useful in the diagnosis and, and management of these sorts of patients. Okay, we're going to switch gears a little bit because we've been talking about the air and the volumes and capacities coming in and out of the lung. That's great but remember we've got this dead space and so. Knowing these numbers doesn't necessarily tell you how much fresh air is actually getting into the alveoli. And that's all that matters, is how much is getting into the alveoli, because they're the only portions of the lung that can exchange with the circulation. And so remembering that we had this 150 mils of dead space from the trachea, the bronchi, the bronchioles. Then that is going to equal about a 150 mills of volume and that means when you take in fresh air the first 150 mills that enter the lung are going to be from the dead space and then you have 350 ml of a total, total volume of 500 mills that's fresh air because that last 150 ml is going to fill up. The conducting airways, the dead space. And so, that means that you have to consider the dead space and it's volume when you're trying to calculate the alveolar ventilation, how much fresh air is getting into the alveoli. So in this chart, we've got three subjects that all are Having a mini-, minute ventilation of 6,000 mills per minute. So into their respiratory system their taking 6,000 mills in a minute, however they're doing it with three different breathing patterns. One is breathing 150 mills each time they take in a breath 40 times. So remember we calculated this before. 150 times 40 is going to be 6,000. That's going to be, determine your minute ventilation, tile volume times respiratory rate. The second person is breathing in 500 mills 12 times a minute. That still equals 6,000. And the last person is taking in very large breath. A whole liter at a time. But only six times. So that's again going to equal 6,000. However, to calculate the alveolir ventilation, we have to subtract from the tidal volume, the volume of the dead space. And so that means in the person that is, that has a tidal volume 150 mils and their dead space is 150 mils means that the alveolar ventilation, the amount of fresh air we're, we're reaching their alveoli is 0. Compared to the person who is breathing in 1,000 times minus 150. They're still getting plenty of air, fresh air into the alveoli each time they breathe. And so their alveolar ventilation is 5,100. So, this makes a huge difference. In terms of looking out, at alveolar ventilation compared to just minute ventilation of the whole respiratory system. Now we can even go farther and say, okay, we know what alveolar ventilation is and We know that oxygen is going to be about 21% of air. So then we can start to think about what is going to be the pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. So remember that air is going to be mostly nitrogen, 21% oxygen and carbon dioxide is going to be extremely low. So we can almost ignore it. And then when we want to calculate partial pressures, we're going to say that the total pressure is going to be equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the gases that are present. So to calculate the pressure of oxygen, we're going to say that the fraction of inspired error That is oxygen is going to be 0.21% times atmospheric pressure, that meaning that in the air that we breathe, the pressure of oxygen is 160 millimeters of mercury. The catch is that when we bring the air into the lung, remember we said that the conducting zones, the dead space is going to warm the air and humidify the air, so that alveolar air is going to have water vapor added. Which is 47 millimeters of mercury. And so that reduces the contribution of oxygen if our pressure's still 760 so that the partial pressure of oxygen in the air that's coming into the alveoli is going to be 150 millimeters of mercury. So the last thing we're going to consider in this session is then, okay what does that mean for the oxygen in the alveoli? Because remember, in a previous figure we showed that if our title volume is only five hundred milliliters, and 150 of it That is filling dead space. That means we only have 350 mills coming into a respiratory system that's much larger than that. That's many liters, and so that means that 1st of all the, the fresh air is going to be diluted. As well as the fact that, obviously, with oxygen. The oxygen's going to be removed from the, air in the lung. And that CO2 is going to be added to the air in the lung from circulation. So with all of those considerations. That means that the pressures of. Oxygen and co2 in the alveoli is going to be very differnt from what it is in the air that we breathe. So, you can see that the o2 pressure is going to be 105 because it's constantly being removed from the lung. And that co2, so that's. Low compared to 160, and that the C02 instead of being 0.3 like it is in air, it's in the lung going to be about 40 millimeters of mercury because there's constantly C02 being removed from the blood. And every time you breathe you don't just replace all of the air in your lung with fresh air. Okay? So let's also just look briefly at circulation that the pressures of the gases in the circulation. We're going to talk about this much more but notice that the blood coming into the lung that's deoxygenated has a pressure of oxygen of about 40. Co2 about 46, but by the time they have gone through, the circulation has gone through the lungs, things are almost equillibrated. So oxygen's gone from 40 milliliters of mercury to 100. It's almost completely equilibrated with the lung that's 105. And the CO2 has gone from 46 to 40 so it has equilibrated with the CO2 the air, and the lung being 40 as well. But you
 can see how Since the, under most circumstances in a healthy person, the alveolar gasses are going to basically match the oxygenated blood coming from the lungs in the arteries. And so we, you can use the systemic arteriole blood gas pressures, as a very good approximation of the alveolar gas pressures since those are not going to really be easily measured. So let's just cover the key concepts where we talked about, before we talked about minute ventilation. But now we've talked about alvelar ventilation and how that's going to be the most important concept and number to know in terms of understanding what, how much fresh air is getting into the lung. And then we talked about how we've got this dead space, and that, that is going to be the reason why alveolar ventilation is going to be different from just minute ventilation.</p>
