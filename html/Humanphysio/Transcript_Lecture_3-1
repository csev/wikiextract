<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
In the last three sessions, we talked about the senses, so that was a type of afferent pathway, or the type of afferent pathway for the nervous system. And so now, in the next two sessions, we are going to talk about one type of efferent pathway, the somatic nervous system, which is going to be the portion of the nervous system that is going to control skeletal muscle.<br />
In this first session, we are going to talk about just some general principles about the somatic nervous system.<br />
Then, we are going to talk about the kind of the structure of where the cell bodies are for these neurons that are controlling skeletal muscle, and then also talk about the neuromuscular junction (the junction between the neuron and the skeletal muscle). 
Then, in the second session, we are going to talk about the control of movement. We are going to talk about some reflexes and some sensory receptors that are going to be important for controlling skeletal muscle, which will be our next module.<br />
So this is just review. We have talked about the sensory systems, which are going to feed into the central nervous system. And then, we have several types of efferent systems, the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system, which is going to control the organs, whereas the somatic nervous system controlling skeletal muscle.<br />
Also remember that the anatomy of the two different types of efferent systems is different.  </p>
<p><strong>Somatic vs. Autonomic</strong><br />
Remember that for the somatic nervous system, we have our cell body in the central nervous system, it sends an axon to control the skeletal muscle, and it travels all the way to that, that muscle. So these are going to be very long neurons with their cell bodies primarily sitting in the spinal cord for most of the body. For the head, they are sitting in the brain stem.<br />
This is in contrast to the autonomic nervous system, where there are two neurons in series, which means that there is one set of cell bodies of neurons sitting in the periphery of the body, outside of the central nervous system, and that is going to occur in ganglia.<br />
Also keep in mind, that the somatic nervous system, even though it is controlling skeletal muscle, still controls some involuntary actions.<br />
So, we are going to talk about some reflexes that are going to be controlled by the somatic nervous system. And it is also going to control muscle like the diaphragm, which is skeletal muscle. There are lots of different types of movements that the somatic nervous system controls.  </p>
<p><strong>Cell Bodies</strong><br />
Let's start from where the cell body is going to be sitting. Remember for most of the body, the cell body of the neuron is going to be in the spinal cord. If it is controlling a muscle in the head, it is going to be sitting in the brain stem, and if you take a cross section of the spinal cord, there is a kind of butterfly shaped gray matter in the center surrounded by white matter.<br />
All of the cell bodies of neurons in the spinal cord are going to be in the gray matter. The white matter has processes, like axons running through it. Not only are all the cell bodies going to be in that grey matter, but they are also segregated based on their role.<br />
For somatic nervous system neurons, their cell bodies are going to be sitting in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, not in the dorsal horn. So, we are going to have these neuron cell bodies sitting in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the next session, we will be talking more about other neuron types that are going to be important for controlling neurons, and some of which will be in other parts of the gray matter.  </p>
<p><strong>Innervation</strong><br />
We know the neuron that is controlling skeletal muscle is going to send an axon out of the central nervous system, out of the spinal cord, into the periphery where it is going to then synapse with the muscle that it controls.<br />
A single neuron is going to control 3 to 1000 fibers depending on the use of that muscle and of that neuron. All of those fibers, which are the same thing as a muscle cell, are going to be in the same muscle, but spread out. That is what is shown in this diagram here, where the dark red muscle cells or fibers are innervated by a single neuron. So you can see how this one neuron that is controlling several dozen fibers, all those fibers are in a single muscle, and they are kind of spread out throughout the muscle. 
This single neuron and the muscle fibers (or cells) that it innervates (or it controls) is called a motor unit and we are going to be using that phrase, particularly once we start talking about skeletal muscle because it is an important concept. A neuron and the muscle fibers that it controls is a motor unit.<br />
The other thing to keep in mind is that a single muscle cell or fiber is only innervated or controlled by a single neuron and that is important. If it receives an impulse, it is coming from one neuron. It is not coming from several neurons. A muscle cell is just told whether or not to contract by one neuron. It is not trying to integrate information from several neurons and decide whether or not to contract. It is just controlled by a single neuron.  </p>
<p><strong>The Neuromuscular Junction</strong>
Now lets just move a little farther down the system to the actual neuromuscular junction. And actually most of this is review. It is very similar to the synapse that we talked about earlier, where if the neuron fires an action potential, it is going to travel down the axon, which is going to be myelinated, and that is going to reach the terminus of the axon. That action potential is then going to cause voltage-gated calcium channels to open, which is going to increase the calcium at the end of that axon and cause vesicles filled with acetylcholine to be released.<br />
These are colonergic synapses because the neurotransmitter that is released is going to be aceytlcholine. The acetylcholine is then going to diffuse into the synapse and diffuse to the skeletal muscle membrane, and the spot where this neuromuscular junction is happening, that spot on the skeletal muscle plasma membrane, is called the motor end plate.<br />
The motor end plate is going to express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so those are ligand-gated sodium channels. The ligand is acetylcholine. So the acetylcholine is going to quickly diffuse to these sodium channels, and that is going to let sodium rush into the skeletal muscle cell, which is then going to depolarize the membrane in this area. And sitting right next door are going to be voltage-gated sodium channels.<br />
For all intents and purposes, whenever you have an action potential coming down from the neuron, it is going to be adequate enough to activate these voltage-gated sodium channels, which is then going to cause an action potential to spread out throughout the whole membrane of this muscle fiber. And we will be talking a lot more about how that happens and about what that means and how that triggers contraction when we talk about skeletal muscles.<br />
It is very similar to just a normal neuron to neuron synapse, but we have lots of these voltage-gated sodium channels, so that every time we have an action potential in the neuron, we are going to cause an action potential in the skeletal muscle.<br />
In this first session, we have talked about how the somatic nervous system is going to control lots of different movements because it is controlling skeletal muscle, and that most of the neurons are going to be sitting in the spinal cord or the brain stem.<br />
An important concept is that motor neuron and the muscle cells (or fibers) that it innervates is going to be a motor unit. We are going to use that term a fair amount. 
We also talked about how these motor neurons are going to be seen specifically in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, and we are going to talk a lot more about this third key concept in the next session, where we are going to start to talk about other neurons in the spinal cord, and how these sensory inputs are going to be brought into the spinal cord, and then how that is going to determine what kind of response that the somatic nervous system is going to initiate.</p>
