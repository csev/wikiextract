<p>In this third video, we're going to talk more about the pressure changes that are going to occur during breathing and then we're going to talk also more about airway resistance. 
So remember how I told you that whenever the chest wall is going to move, the lung is going to move with it. And so this slide is showing you why, where the lung is surrounded by a fluid-filled sac. Kind of like if you put your hand into a water balloon. Where the outside of the water balloon, the parietal pleura is going to be attached to the chest wall, and then the visceral pleura, the inside of the balloon is going to be attached to the lung. 
And so, because there's fluid in between those two layers, then anywhere the chest wall goes, the lung is going to follow. So if you have two glass plates with water between them, you can slide them along one another fairly easily, but it's very hard to just pull them straight apart. 
And so it's that surface tension of the water that is the same thing that's acting here to keep the lungs going in the same direction and following whatever the chest wall does. </p>
<p><strong>Pressure Gradients</strong><br />
So because of that now we can consider different pressures in the system and how those change during breathing. 
So we've got atmospheric pressure, which we know is 760 millimeters of mercury. For our purposes we're now going to consider that 0, just to make things more simple. So we're going to consider atmospheric pressure 0. 
Then we have, of course, alveolar pressure, that we've already talked about. And we're going to assume that the pressure outside in the body is going to be atmospheric pressure. 
And then we can also consider now the intrapleural pressure, the pressure in the intrapleural fluid. 
So, let's look at the forces that are happening here, where just at rest, the chest wall is trying to recoil out, and open up more. And then we said, we know we have the recoil of the lung from the elastic tissue. And so now, we have opposing forces acting on this intrapleural fluid. 
that means that compared to atmospheric pressure, this intrapleural fluid is often going to be negative. 
we already know that the alveolar pressure compared to atmospheric pressure is going to be what determines air flow. Whether it's going to flow in or out of the lung
the alveolar pressure compared to the intrapleural pressure is going to determine the size of the lung. 
And we're going to see an example of that in this slide where we're going to look at the changes in the pressure as we inhale and exhale. So we're going to start looking at the end of expiration. They're just sitting there at rest. 
And that's going to be really similar to the last slide that we looked at. Atmospheric pressure will be 0. The alveolar pressure, which you can also P big A. That's how we're going to refer to it. Is also going to be 0. The pressure out here in the body will be 0. 
And because of the lung recoil and the chest wall recoil our pressure in the intrapleural space is going to be minus 4. 
Then, once we start to take in a breath, the chest wall is going to expand, so we're going to have an increased force from the chest wall. And the chest wall and the lung are going to get bigger.
we still have the elastic recoil from the lung, we have an increased force from the chest wall being expanded, so now our intrapleural pressure is even more negative, it's minus 6. So that's going to work against that lung recoil to open up the lung. 
Because now the lung has gotten larger, remember we said we use negative pressure breathing, now the lung's gotten larger with the same number of air molecules, now our pressure's gone down. It's minus 1, whereas obviously atmospheric pressure is going to be 0. 
So that means we're going to have air flowing from high pressure to low pressure into the lung, until at the end of inspiration, we have our maximal force form the chest wall being opposed maximally by the recoil of the lung because it's been stretched even farther. And so now, our intrapleural pressure is minus 7. So we've got an even larger negative pressure in that intrapleural space.
 And now since we've reached the end of inspiration, and we've had time for equilibration, now the pressure in the alveoli and in the lung is going to be zero, which is going to match the atmospheric pressure. 
Then when we start to expire, and do an exhalation, then we're going to remove this force from the chest wall. We're still going to have the recoil from the lung. And so, our intrapleural pressure will be reduced, it'll be something like minus 5 in this example. 
So now we've, since we've reduced the pressure or the force coming from the chest wall, our intrapleural pressure is now less negative. And so now, the lung is going to get smaller. And if the lung gets smaller with the same amount of air in it, then its pressure is going to, to increase.
And in this example, they are saying it's increased to 1 compared to 0 in atmosphere, and so now, air is going to, to flow out until we come back to the state where we started, where we got some forces both some small forces acting on the intrapleural fluid, so it's still negative and we've equilibrated to the atmospheric pressure in the lung. 
So the intrapleural pressure being negative compared to the lung, or at least have less pressure then the lung pressure is important in keeping the lung open. This is what I call the plastic lung and it's going to demonstrate a lot of the principles that we've been talking about in terms of the pressures that are occurring and changing during breathing. 
So the black balloon is going to represent the lung and then the air in the canister is going to represent the intrapleural space. And then, if I pull on this latex at the bottom, then I'm going to make the volume inside the canister larger, which is going to decrease the pressure in the interplural space. Which is going to occur during inhalation. And it's going to expand the lungs. So as I make the air chamber large, which means the pressure's going to go down, then the lung is going to follow. That's what we talked about of the difference between The pressure inside the alveoli verses the intrapleural pressure is going to determine the size of the lung, and that's what's happening here. Decrease the intrapleural pressure, the lung is going to expand. Increase it by making the chamber smaller, and the lung contracts. 
Then remember we also talked about how it's important that the intrapleural pressure always be Less than the pressure in the lung. That, if not, you're going to have the lung collapse, which is a pneumothorax, which happens to people if they have fluid or air enter the intrapleural space. And so when I remove this stopper, which is going to let. The chamber equalize with the atmospheric pressure, which is the same pressure inside the balloon, you'll see how the balloon collapses. And we've, now have a collapsed lung. </p>
<p><strong>how resistance affects air flow</strong><br />
if we increase the resistance, then that's going to reduce flow of air just like it did in the cardiovascular system with the blood.
the factors that can affect the resistance
And so, obviously, we know one huge factor is going to be just the diameter of the tube, of the airway. Where the smaller the diameter, the greater the resistance. 
And in the lung each success of branching of the system, just like in the circulatory system, is going to be smaller. However, we're going to have more of them. And so even though the Individual tubes get smaller. 
As a group, they're going to be, have a larger area and so the resistance is going to get lower as you move into the lung because we've got more tubes even though they might be smaller in diameter. 
We also know that the bronchioles are going to be able to constrict and relax much like the arterials in the circulatory system. 
This is going to be under nervous system control, where parasympathetic stimulation is going to cause the smooth muscle to contract, sympathetic to cause relaxation. And the way I remember this is, if you increase sympathetic tone, that's fight or flight. Which means you're going to want to be able to exercise and or run away. And so to be able to run away, you're going to need to relax your bronchioles to be able to get more air into the lung. 
when the lung is very full, that the airways are not as compressed, and so that resistance is going to go down. And so that's a compensation sometimes for someone with an obstructive lung disease that has stuff blocking the airways is to kind of breathe at a higher volume, which is going to have everything be more expanded, and reduce the resistance in the airways, and so that, we'll see in a minute, can be a compensation to lung disease, particularly obstruct, obviously obstructive diseases. 
And then there's also an effect, not only of elastic recoil on the lung which is what we've focused on, but also elastic recoil of the airways. And so if that's missing then they can kind of get floppy and become a little bit more collapsed which again is going to increase the resistance.   </p>
<p><strong>Air Flow</strong><br />
So we're going to talk about how this is important in air flow out of the lung and particularly during what we call forced exhalation which is when you're using all your muscles to contract and try to get the air out of the lung. 
And so, in this case, in a normal individual, which is shown on the left, the intrapleural pressure can become positive, compared to the atmospheric pressure. That's fine, as long as it doesn't become greater than the pressure in the lung, or it's going to collapse the lung. 
So in this forced exhalation, the pressure in the alveoli is going to become much greater than atmospheric pressure, and it's going to be greater than the intrapleural pressure but the intrapleural pressure can still be above atmospheric pressure. 
So as the air leaves the lung, because of the resistance of the tubes, the pressure will go down. And in a normal lung, that's okay, because it's usually not going to be below intraplural pressure until it's at a spot where there's cartilage. So that even though at this spot intrapleural pressure is greater than the pressure in this tube, it's not going to collapse because there's cartilage that's holding it open. 
The problem occurs in someone with an obstructive lung disease, which is shown on the right, because their lungs are different and they've got an issue with resistance, 
so for instance, someone with emphysema where they don't have that recoil of the lung helping to increase the pressure in the lung. So that even though they have the same interpleural pressure they're exerting the same force onto their lung without that recoil helping. Then the pressure inside the alveoli is lower. Than the pressure in a normal person. Then if they also have increased resistance in their airways, which is going to cause the pressure that started out lower also to fall more quickly. Then you can get to a point where now, here if this pressure's 50 inside this airway and we said the pressure in the interplural space is 60, we're going to have a compression of that airway. So we've got reduced formation of the pressure in the aveoli and then you can have increased resistance in top of that. So that the equal pressure point happens at a spot that doesn't have cartilage. And so, then, that airway will compress. But then the pressure will build up, and it will open. But then it will compress again. And so it's called dynamic compression. And that can be heard by a physician listening to someone's lungs.   </p>
<p>some of these pressures that are occurring in different parts of the system
how the difference between the alveolar pressure and the intrapleural pressure is going to determine the lung size.
the alveolar pressure versus the atmospheric pressure is going to determine which way and how quickly air flows in and out of the lung. 
airway resistance is going to be increasing during expiration because everything's collapsing and everything's compressing. 
And then during forced expiration, when the intrapleural pressure becomes positive, then that's when you have the potential for these airways to become collapsed because it's not going to be good for the intrapleural pressure to be greater than the lung pressure, unless you have cartilage there, to keep the airway open.</p>
