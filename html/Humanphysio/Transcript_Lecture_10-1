<p>Greetings. Today we're going to discuss the urinary system. This is going to take about four different lectures to cover all of the urinary system, and then at the end, we're also going to talk about acid base control, and how the urinary system, or the kidney, functions in coordination with the respiratory system to balance the pH of the body </p>
<p>But today, in this first lecture what we want to talk about are going to be these the following learning objectives. The first is we want to describe the structure of the kidney. Second, list the homeostatic functions for the body. And third, describe the structure of the kidney nephron, and this is the small filtering unit, that is going to do the work. </p>
<p>So you have two kidneys in your body and emitting from the kidney is a ureter. This is a tube which is going to take the urine that's made from the kidney down to the bladder, and in the bladder you have storage of the urine until you decide to void it from the body. And then that's done through another tube which is called the urethra. </p>
<p>So the kidney itself is a filter of the blood. It's going to filter the the blood. You have about 20% of the blood that's passing through a specific region or through the kidney, and that will become the filtrate. And the filtrate then is the presumptive urine and we will change that kind of of material that's within the urine as it passes through the little filtering units such that the urine can have a variable concentration of ions and of water. </p>
<p>The homeostatic functions of the kidney are several. The first is that this is the only organ that's able to balance fluid within fluid compartments of the body. This is the size of your fluid compartments. So the kidney is going to be the one that's going to balance the amount of water that's within these different fluid compartments. Secondly, it balances electrolytes, and that in particular is balancing the amount of potassium that's within the body, or within the plasma. Third, the kidney is used to eliminate these liquid waste from the body. And fourth, we have it's use for the secretion of specific organic substances such as drugs, like morphine or penicillin and also vitamins, such as your vitamin A, vitamin K and so forth. They're eliminated by the kidney. </p>
<p>The kidney has many endocrine functions and very important endocrine functions. The first of which is that it secretes a hormone, which is called erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is increased in response to hypoxia within the kidney. And this erythropoietin is used in the bone marrow to increase the production of red blood cells. You must have erythropoietin to differentiate the RBCs, or the red blood cells from the bone marrow. </p>
<p>The second is a hormone called renin, and we're going to talk about renin in great detail in one of the later lectures. But renin is a hormone that is released from the kidney when the kidney perceives low pressures. So it thinks that the body has low blood pressure. And under these conditions, renin is released, and renin then will cause a cascade of other hormones and factors to be released, which will increase blood pressure. And as I said, we'll talk about this in great detail in a later lecture. </p>
<p>And then lastly, the kidney activates vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is made by the skin, the prohormone is made by the skin in response to UV radiation. And this prohormone is inactive. It's delivered to the kidney, and the kidney then, changes the hydroxylation state of the vitamin D, the inactive prohormone informs then the active vitamin D3, which is also known as calcitriol. </p>
<p>So, what does this organ actually look like? So the organ that is drawn here, it has a connected tissue capsule on the outside. It's located retroperitoneal, and it sits at about the small of your back. So these organ is outside of the peritoneal cavity. The the connected tissue capsule encloses the entire organ. </p>
<p>And, at the area which is called the renal pelvis, we have the exiting of the ureter which is some of the giant funnel shaped structure which is gathering all the urine which is generated in the kidney and delivering it to the bladder. In addition, at this site we have the entrance of the renal artery and the exiting of the renal vein. So, the plumbing then for the kidney is coming in and out at this location which is the concave surface of the organ. </p>
<p>Within the organ, the cells of the organ tissue (within the organ) are divided into two regions. One is called the cortex and this is this outer zone. And the second is the region that's that's within the middle of the organ and that's called the medalla. And that's this area. These two areas, then, are very important in the functioning of the kidney, and we'll talk about this in great detail later. The little filtering units that are within the kidney are called nephrons, and that's what's shown here it is an enlarged nephron which is this gold structure. The nephrons are positioned partially within the cortex and partially within the madala, and their arrangement is actually critical for the functioning of the nephrons. </p>
<p>The nephron, this little filtering unit, there are 10 million of them in each kidney. So they are composed of a two different components. One is the vasculature, and the second is the renal tubule. The vasculature, the blood, as I said, enters as the renal artery, and then it goes directly into the cortex where it splits off into these afferent arterioles. The afferent arterioles will enter into a ball of capillaries, and this ball of capillaries is called the glomerulus, glomerulus meaning "ball". The capillary then is drained by an efferent arteriole. So we have an afferent arteriole leading into the capillary, and an efferent arteriole which exits the capillary. As the efferent arteriole exits from the capillary, it breaks into a second capillary bed, and this second capillary bed is shown here. The second capillary bed is critical for the function of the renal filtering units. </p>
<p>So, we have a portal system. The first capillary bed is the glomerulus, and it's connected to a second capillary bed, and that's by the efferent arteriole. This is an unusual structure we don't have affarent arterioles or efferent arterioles usually feeding a capullary bed. That's the first thing, and secondly we have this portal system where we have a capullary bed which has an arteriole connecting to a second capullary bed. So that's the circulatory portion of the filtering area, and the second part is the renal tubule itself. </p>
<p>So the renal tubule is a blind ended structure which at the blind end, it encases the first capillary bed, or the glomerulus, and this is called Bowman's capsule and that's what's shown here. So Bowman's capsule makes this little cup-like structure around the glomerulus. Bowman's capsule is continuous with the rest of the renal tubule, and the rest of the renal tubule are these sort of yellow tubules, which are diagrammed in this structure. The tubules are within the cortex but they also can extend down into the medulla, return to the cortex, and then eventually connect to what is called the collecting duct. Many nephrons will drain into a single collecting duct and so all the urine that's being made in these little nephrons is collected into the collecting duct, and the collecting duct then will drain this material from the cortex to the medulla, and then at the medulla, all of the urine is gathered into the ureter, which is that funnel like structure. That's at the hilar region. The urine then exits from the kidney. </p>
<p>So the renal tubule, has multiple regions within it, and each of them has an important function. And we're going to talk about the functions of these different regions in successive lectures. But the tubule regions then, include Bowman's capsule, which is the first structure. And that's the one that surrounds the first capillary bed or the glomerulus. The second is called the proximal convoluted tubule. And a proximal convoluted tubule is contained completely within the cortex. The proximal convoluted tubule drains into a thin loop, and that's what shown here. So the thin loop of Henle is descending down in this particular case into the medulla. And then the loop of Henle returns to the cortex. And it does so in what's called, the thick ascending loop. And the thick ascending loop then drains into the distal convoluted tubule and that's also within the cortex. So the distal convoluted tubules are here. And lastly, as we said, the, these distal convoluted tubules will drain into the collecting duct and multiple nephrons will drain into that collecting duct. And that will take the urine then, to the ureter and out from the organ. </p>
<p>So as we go through the different regions of the tubule, we'll see that the filtrate, which is being made at the first capillary bed Bowman's capsule junction, and this is called filtration, so we're going to filter the plasma that's flowing through that first capillary bed. The fluid enters into the renal tubule, and this fluid we call a filtrate. In a single day, there will be 180 liters per day of this filtrate, which is being made by this kidney. And the osmolarity of the filtrate is the same as plasma, so that there'll be 300 milliosmolar material within the filtrate as there is within the plasma. By the time we come to the end of the proximal convoluted tubule, we only have 54 liters per day, which means that within the proximal convoluted tubule, we've been absorbing a lot of the fluids, a lot of ions, a lot of the solutes, amino acids, glucose, and so forth. They are going to be moved back from that filtrate back into the body. And they're going to be moving back into the body in a manner that is iso-osmostic with the fluids so that the fluid retains its osmolarity and it stays at 300 milliosmolar. </p>
<p>But by the time we get to the end of the loop of Henle, there are only 18 liters per day of filtrate, which is ending at the end of that loop. And at that point now, the filtrate is hypo-osmotic. This means that we have removed more solutes than we have water, and so the material now is hypo-osmotic to to the cells, which are 300 milliosmoles, and to the blood which is at 300 milliosmoles. This filtrate is delivered to the distal convoluted tubule and then from the distal convoluted tubule into the collecting duct. And at the end of the collecting duct we'll have our final urine. And this is only one and a half litters per day. So we filtered 180 litters per day. We made 180 litters of filtrate per day. But only one and a half litters per day is being lost from the body as urine. And if you notice, the osmolarity of that material is variable, so it can be as dilute as 50 milliosmoles and as concentrated as 1,200 milliosmoles. And as we go through our lectures, we're going to talk about how the kidney is able to change the osmolarity of the final urine and the volume of the final urine which is being put out from the on a daily basis. </p>
<p>So I diagrammed the renal tubule here, and showed the afferent and efferent arterioles and the glomerulus. So the afferent arteriole is this structure. The blood is draining into this circular region, which is the glomerulus, and then from the glomerulus the blood is exiting into the efferent arteriole. The blood then enters into a second capillary bed, and that's what's shown here. And the second capillary bed in the cortex is called the peritubular capillary. Now around that first glomerulus, that first capillary bed, we have Bowman's capsule, and that's what's diagrammed here. So this is the blind end of the renal tubule. And that tubule then extends, from the these glomerulus until it reaches the collecting duct. At this first site, we have what's called filtration. And so this is where we're going to be moving solutes and water from the glomerulus across the epithelium that's lining Bowman's capsule, and into the renal tubule. So this is Bowman's capsule. And the movement, then, of this solute and the filtrates is going to be called a filtration, and at this point, we are not going to have any cells moving across here or large proteins. This is going to be simply small molecules, something that's less than three 35,000 molecular weight and we're going to have freely filtered ions. They are now in our filtrate, and the filtrate is going to move then from Bowman's capsule to the end of the tubule. </p>
<p>And as it goes along the end of the tubule, we can have movement of some of the solutes and water back into that second capillary. And that's called reabsorption. And that's whats designated as the r. In addition, we can move material from the blood itself. From that capillary bed. The second capillary bed directly into the renal tubule. And this is called secretion as best designated by s. So we're moving materials from the blood space directly into the renal tubule. And what is excreted that is what's left in the urine and removed from the body is called excretion. </p>
<p>Many items are filtered through freely, and they are not reabsorbed, and they are not secreted and simply are excreted from the body. The filtration rate would be a measure of their movement through the system. So their filtration rate is going to be equal to their excretion rate. They have no net reabsorption, and they have no no net secretion. If the filtration rate of the substance is greater than it's excretion rate, then it has a net reabsorption. And an example of that would be glucose. So for instance, glucose is freely filtered across this region, but 100% of the glucose that enters into the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed by the tubule and moved back into the blood, so that there is zero glucose in a normal kidney in the urine. The filtration rate is less than the excretion rate means that there had to be net secretion. And an example of this would be penicillin. So penicillin, for instance is a drug which is not filtered, so it enters into the filtrate, but it is also secreted. So that this amount of penicillin that's being excreted from the body will be greater than that of a substance which is simply filtered by the body, and neither reabsorbed nor secreted. And we're going to talk about these different functions in more detail the next time we meet. </p>
<p>But to just remind you, then we have these important terms because the net effect along this tubule is what happens to the to the volume in the content of the urine. So the first is that we're going to make this filtrate, and this is called filtration and this is going to be movement of the solutes and water across our first barrier. And that barrier is composed of the endothelium of the capillary, the glomerulus (the basal lamina) which is the extracellular material that is made by these cells and the epithelium of the Bowman's capsule. So that's our filtration unit, and we're moving solutes and water across that region. They enter into the lumen of the renal tubule and that generates our filtrate. </p>
<p>Secondly, we can have reabsorption of material and this would be the movement of the solutes and water from the lumen of the tubule back directly into the blood. And this is going to be across the epithelial cells which are lining the renal tuble and the epithelial cells which are lining the blood. Thirdly, we can have secretion, and this is the movement of a solute from the blood itself directly into the renal tubule. And this is going to again cross the epithelial cells of the blood, the capilary, and of the epithelial cells that are lining the renal tubule to enter into the filtrate and be within these lumen of the renal tubule. And then finally, excretion is simply what's left. So, it's the amount that we filtered, minus the amount that we reabsorbed, plus anything that we've added by secretion. That's what would be excreted then within the urine. </p>
<p>Okay, so what are some of our general concepts? So the first then is that the kidneys' primary functions are to maintain the fluid volumes of the body, and it does so by regulating the salt balance. And it maintains the osmolarity of the body by regulating the water balance. Secondly, its homeostatic functions include removal of wastes and detoxification of drugs. Thirdly, the kidney secretes hormones, and this can this can include erythropoietin in response to hypoxia, renin in response to low blood pressure, and it activates vitamin D3. Fourth, the kidney contains a million filtering units, and these are called nephrons, and each nephron is fed by a portal system. This is the circulatory system. So we have an afferent arteriole coming into a glomerulus, which is a capillary bed, and it's drained by a second efferent arteriole, and then that goes into a second capillary bed. And five, the filtration occurs across the first capillary bed. That's going to be the glomerulus. And then we'll have reabsorption and secretion and that will occur along the renal tubules to alter the composition of the filtrate. The final product is urine, and this is what's going to leave the kidney via the ureter. To be stored within the bladder and eventually expelled from the body via the urethra. Okay, so the next time we meet then, we're going to talk about how we control filtration. So see you then.</p>
