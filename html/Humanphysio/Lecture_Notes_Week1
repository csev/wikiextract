<ul>
<li>Homeostasis is maintenance of a steady state. </li>
<li>60% of total body mass is water.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two fluid compartments: </p>
<p>A. Extracellular fluid Compartment (or space )-ECF.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vascular fluid (IVF) - Fluid in blood vessels,and  </li>
<li>Interstitial fluid (ISF)- Fluid between the cells </li>
</ul>
<p>B. Intracellular fluid Compartment (or space)-ICF.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cells have greater potassium(K)  ion concentration than the ECF.   </li>
<li>Cells have a lower sodium(Na)ion concentration  than the ECF. 
<ul><li>The transmembrane Na/K ATPase allows the cell to maintain this concentration difference by actively expelling more sodium from the cell while taking more K into the cell interior using energy from ATP.Poor passive transfer across the cell membrane ensures Na/K don't diffuse down their concentration gradients </li>
</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>C.Body Water and Compartments .</p>
<p>*60% of your total body mass is water .In relation to the 2 compartments:-
<ul><li>2/3 of the water (40%) is in the intracellular compartment;
</li><li>The remaining 1/3(20% )is in the extracellular compartment. </p>
</li></ul>

<p>*Interstitial Space and  Intra-Vascular Space together make up the Extra-Cellular Fluid Compartment.
<ul><li>25% of the Extracellular fluid is intra-vascular.
</li><li>75% of the Extracellular fluid is interstitial. 
</li><li>For a standardized 70 Kg "physiological person" 
</li><li>Total body water is 60&#160;% x 70 Kg = 42 kg ( assuming 1kg =1L of water ) this is 42 L 
</li><li>ECF is 1/3 x total body water ( =14L ) 
</li><li>Intravascular volume = 1/4 x ECF= 1/4 x 1/3 =1/12 of total body water (=3.5L )  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>D.Homeostasis&#160;:<br />
<ul><li>Homeostasis is maintenance of a steady state by the body's control systems .
</li><li>Feedback is a method to achieve homeostasis allowing the body's cells  and systems to self regulate.
</li><li>Feedback works like a thermostat. To maintain the  desired set point the thermostat will raise the temperature when the temperature is below set point, or cool down if the temperature is above set point.This keeps temperature in the desired range.<br />
</li><li>To maintain salt/water balance -cells in the brain sense the concentration of intra-vascular fluid.If high then signals to increase thirst (to increase water intake ) or increase sodium loss  result in reduced concentration. If dilute then signals to the kidneys to induce more watery urine production or preserve salt raises concentration. Either way the status quo is maintained keeping salt concentration in a narrow range.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_1.2_Feedback_-_Homeostatic_Control">Lecture 1.2  Feedback - Homeostatic Control</span></h2>
<p>I. Local Response<br />
II. Reflexes: responses at a distance<br />
1.  Negative feedback loop<br />
2.  Positive feedback loop<br />
3.  Tonic control<br />
4.  Antagonistic control<br />
5.  Circadian rhythm  </p>
<p>LOCAL FEEDBACK<br />
<ul><li> One cell contacting another neighbor chemically - paracrine.
</li><li> Or the cells sends chemical feedback to itself - autocrine. This occurs in the GI tract.<br />
</li><li> Or the cells have a bridge or connection to each other through a gap junction or nexus. This third one occurs within the cardiac system that allows the cells to act in unison (depends on calcium).  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>REFLEX LOOP  - DISTANT FEEDBACK
Two major systems<br />
1.  Endocrine<br />
2.  Nervous  </p>
<ul>
<li>The endocrine system secrets a chemical into the blood stream that reaches a target cell that has receptors for that chemical.  This causes a change in its activity.  </li>
<li>Nervous system secrets a chemical that crosses a small space to the receptor cell, a nerve, a gland, a muscle. It binds to the receptor on the cell and causes a change in its activity. Between nerve cells this is called the synaptic gap.  </li>
</ul>
<p>A review of the reflex components.<br />
A stimulus - 1. Sensor (an inward afferent path) - 2. Integration center (brain with set point) - 3. Effector – response (efferent path – out) - makes an adjustment or eliminates the stimulus (a negative reflex loop).  </p>
<p>Examples body gets cold or body in fever (set point heights ARE DIFFERENT)  </p>
<ul>
<li>Negative feedback can be simple or complex. The efferent path with one cell or with multiple cells affecting each other in turn until it reaches and eliminates the stimulus.  </li>
<li>Positive feedback enhances a stimulus instead of eliminating it. Positive feedback can occur by increasing sensitivity of target cell to the feedback, like increasing the number of receptors on the target cell (like in female hormones FSH). Or another way is to cause the target cell to secret more of the initiating chemical that starts a cascading process (like in blood clotting).  </li>
<li>Then we will need something to stop it. That is a negative feedback loop that stops the cascade.  </li>
</ul>

<p>TONIC CONTROL<br />
<ul><li> Another type of control is a tonic  modulation. Instead of turning something on or off, control the amount of blood vessel size.<br />
</li><li> The sympathetic nervous system can cause muscle cells to contract to decrease the lumen of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction) or relax (vasodialation) thus modulating the size of the blood vessel lumen from a normal state (basal state).  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>ANTAGONISTIC CONTROL<br />
SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROL<br />
<ul><li> We have a baseline or intrinsic heart rate that is affected by the sympathetic nervous system (increases the heart rate) or the parasympathetic nervous system to decrease the heart rate.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>CIRCADIAN RHYTHM<br />
<ul><li> A 24 hour rhythmic cycle. Hormones, growth &amp; cortisol affected by sleep.  They affect glucose levels (raise it).<br />
</li><li> Airplane travel and time zones upset the rhythm.  They are regulated by sleeping and waking. Some people are night owls and other are early birds. The circadian rhythms are different.     </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Things to remember</strong>
<ul><li> The brain and the heart come first where blood and oxygen are concerned.<br />
</li><li> We have set points in the body but they can reset to tolerate a difference in temperature…a different time zone..a higher blood pressure etc.</p>
</li></ul>
