<p>Now we've moved to now our sixth session on the respiratory system and this time since we've just talked about oxygen transport, we're going to talk about CO2 transport, then we're going to shift gears and talk about something called V/Q mismatch. V standing for ventilation, Q standing for profusion and how those can sometimes not match up very well. So let's talk about CO2 in the blood where, as we saw with our situation with oxygen, a minority of the CO2 in blood is going to be dissolved. It's going to be about 10% of the CO2 is contributing to what we. Talk about so much the PCO2. A lot of carbon dioxide is going to be bound to hemoglobin in the red blood cells, about 30% of it, but the majority of it is going to be present in the blood as, bicarbonate ion, about 60% of it, and the reason why this happens is due to these two chemical reactions which are really important for you to remember, because we are going to be talking about them in this session and the next session. It's so important. So, what happens is that in the red blood cells, CO2 and water can be combined to form carbonic acid. This is accomplished through an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase that's present in red blood cells and other tissue. Since carbonic acid is an acid. Then that is going to disassociate to form bicarbonate. So, a really important concept is to understand that, because of these reactions. If we increase CO2. That is going to move this reaction this way. Which means we're going to increase the number of protons. Similarly, if we increase the number of protons, we're going to move this reaction the opposite way. Which is going to result in an increase in CO2. So we are going to see how those two molecules. If one changes in concentration, the other is going to change in the same direction. And that's going to be really important. Because one of the roles of the respiratory system is to maintain acid based balance. And this is why this reaction so keep that in mind. Here's a view again similar to what we saw with oxygen of what's going to happen to CO2 when we're in the tissues and then in the blood. So let's start off in the tissues where CO2's going to be produced which means that then, there's going to be a gradient for CO2 where it's higher in the cell than outside of the cell. So, the CO2 will diffuse out of the cell. It will be higher out here, outside of the capillary than it will be inside the capillary, so it will diffuse into the capillary. Some will stay dissolved in the plasma. Some will, because of the diffusion gradient, diffuse into the red blood cell, where some of it will remain dissolved in the red blood cell. We said about 30% of it will bind hemoglobin. And then we also talk about how we're going to have this carbonic anhydrase reaction. So that we're going to produce bicarbonate and a proton. Once we get to the lung. Then we're going to have a gradient where CO2 is going to be low in the lung. And so CO2 will diffuse out of the capillary into the lung which lower the CO2 in the capillary which will allow CO2 to diffuse out of the red blood cell. That will lower CO2 in the red blood cell which will then cause CO2 to come off the hemoglobin in the red cell and cause a reversal of the carbonic anhydrase reaction which will convert bicarbonate in a proton basically to water and CO2. So, we're just going to reverse those reactions and keep a constant gradient which allows diffusion in or out of the red blood cell, much in the same way that we saw with Oxygen. We're going to switch gears to this v q mismatch. Which is going to be that the lung is not perfect. We've got two processes that have to occur, and they need to be at the same level for it to be perfectly efficient. So one is that we have a certain amount of ventilation of the lung, and then we have a, this, a certain amount of profusion of the lung. And if those aren't matching, then that's going to be a waste in the system, and we're going to talk about that. So because of the anatomy and gravity. We're going to have blood flow, which remember is going to be the Q portion of VQ mismatch, and ventilation are going to change along the height of the lung. Where both ventilation and perfusion are going to be greatest at the bottom of the lung. You can see that here, right here, and right here. Blood flow and ventilation are greatest at the bottom of the lung. So let's talk about that and the easiest way for me to understand this is using a slinky. Where this is very similar to the lung where we've got a tissue that is, has compliance. We said it's distensible and it's hanging in the body in the chest cavity just like the slinky. The slinky's stretchable but it's hanging from the top. Which is similar to the lung. So you can see in terms of ventilation, that the slinky has greater compliance. It can stretch more at the bottom compared to up here where since it's got all the rest of the lung hanging off of it, it can't stretch as much because it's already stretched and we talked about how compliance changes based on how the different factors in the lung. So, compliance is greater at the bottom of lung which means ventilation is greater. In terms of profusion, that's going to have two different factors that are going to cause it to be different at the bottom. One is that the lung at the bottom is below the heart, and so with gravity and that being lower than the heart, we are going to have greater perfusion at the bottom of the lung. The other issue comes back to the lung itself, where you can imagine if you have, when you have capillaries between these alveoli that are stretched more than these, that means that blood flow Is going to be more restricted in the capillaries at the, at the top of the lung compared to the bottom of the lung. These capillaries are getting smushed more because the lung here is being weighed down by the rest of the lung. And so these alveoli are a little more stretched compared to the blood vessels down here. So these, that details why both ventilation and profusion are greatest at the bottom of the lung. And you notice how the two lines cross one another, so that the VQ ratio is going to be greater than one at the top of the lung. And at the bottom of the lung it's going to be less than one. So our mismatch is going to be different, based on these 2 lines crossing one another. Where at the top of the lung. We've got more ventilation than we have profusion, and at the bottom of the lung we have more profusion than we have ventilation. So let's talk about some circumstances where that where this can happen besides just the effects of the anatomy and how we do have some ways of trying to equalize the VQ ratio and make it closer to 1. So, if we had decreased airflow to a portion of the lung. Let's say, for some reason. You inhaled something that then got lodged in a bronchus or a large bronchial, which meant that no air could get to the rest of the lung downstream of that portion. What that is going to mean is that the blood in that area is going to have a reduced pressure of oxygen, because you're just not getting fresh air. Unlike what Dr. Jakoy talked to you about with active hyperemia, where if a muscle needs more blood flow. And so if oxygen goes down, CO2 goes up, and other factors like that happen, then you get a vaso relaxation. So that a vaso dilation, so that more blood can get to that muscle. This is the opposite response. So if oxygen goes down in the lung, instead you get vasal constriction. So it, the, basically the lung is saying if I, you're not getting air then my VQ ratio is completely messed up. We've got Q way above V. That's just a waste of profusion, a waste of blood and so it says, I'm going to decrease blood flow to get that VQ ration closer to 1. That's going to allow more blood to go to other parts of the lung that are healthy, that are functioning properly. Another case you could have would be decreased blood flow to a portion of the lung. So, for instance, if you have a blood clot, feeding a portion of the lung, here, what will happen the, in the alveoli, the pressure of CO2 will drop because if there's no blood to drop off CO2, and we know that air doesn't have much CO2, then the pressure of air will drop in the aveoli. That is then going to cause bronchoconstriction. So if we're not getting blood flow to that portion of the lung, there's no point in putting fresh air into that port, portion and so as a response, bronch, the bronchial is constricted which is going to reduce V and get that V Q ratio closer to 1. Again allowing that airflow to go to a portion of the lung that is functioning properly. So we have, just naturally by our anatomy, V/Q mismatch. But then there are diseases they can make that worse, and those, to some extent the lung can try to compensate for those to try to keep mismatch VQ mismatches as close to one. As possible. And you can also see how particularly if this V k, Q mismatch is happening over a large enough portion of the lung, it can affect PaO2. The arterial amount of, of oxygen can be affected by these sorts of disease processes. So we talked about carbon dioxide and how carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood, because we said ten percent of it's going to contribute to PCO2, P low a CO2. And so it is (no period) Going to explain why CO2 is going to be proportional to minute vent, ventilation. Whereas oxygen is going to often be a little bit offset. We have arterial blood gases that we can use to monitor the adequacy of perfusion. And we also talked about how we need matching of Ventilation to perfusion. And that if we don't have that then we could have reduced P little a O2. Which could act like a shunt that's just where blood is just going right by the lungs and not getting oxygenated. And we have these intrinsic mechanisms that we just talked about to try to match V, the, make the
 VQ ratio as close to 1 as possible.</p>
