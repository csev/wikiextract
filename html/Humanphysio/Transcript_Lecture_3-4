<p><strong>Tension</strong><br />
We are going to finish up skeletal muscle by talking about how tension is generated, and then talking about the metabolism of skeletal muscle. So when we ended the last session we talked about having an action potential come and affect the plasma membrane, and it causes an increase in calcium that is going to be fairly brief because then we are going to quickly remove it from the cytosol.   </p>
<p>And so if we have just one action potential that fires and activates the skeletal muscle, it is going to contract and then relax. And that is going to be a twitch. Now, we know from our previous lectures, that an action potential is going to be fairly quick, especially in a neuron in a skeletal muscle and so the action potential duration is only 5 milliseconds, but yet a twitch, lasts 100 milliseconds.   </p>
<p>And so what that means is, that even though we have the refractory period of the sodium channels so that we can only have an all-or-none action potential and the action potentials are not going to be additive, it is still only 5 milliseconds in this system.<br />
And so that means we can have multiple action potentials that are going to be able to fire very frequently before the twitch is over, which means we are going to be able to increase the amount of calcium that is in the fiber, and give the machinery more time to respond to that calcium, so that we can increase tension. and force that the muscle produces as we increase the stimulation of it.   </p>
<p>So that by the time we get by here, when we are having action potentials basically as frequently as you can, then we get to what is called fused tetanus, where we are not having any decrease in force produced by the muscle. It is just maximal force that is sustained versus unfused tetanus, where we are never getting back to complete relaxation, but yet it is not fused. We are still having peaks and valleys just do to the action potential frequency.   </p>
<p>One way of controlling how much force a muscle is producing is to continue to stimulate it, which is going to increase tension, and can eventually lead to tetanus.   </p>
<p><strong>Velocity of Shortening</strong><br />
Now we are going to switch to talking about the velocity of shortening, where you are going to have maximal velocity of shortening with no load. Okay, that kind of makes sense. If you have something very heavy, it takes you a long time to be able to build up the force and to actually move it. And so that is what the beginning of this graph is showing, where when we looked at the velocity versus load, when the load is very light, than we have maximal velocity.   </p>
<p>This is called isotonic shortening because the muscle is getting shorter and we are keeping the same amount of tension. So, we can keep the same amount of tension. and as long as the tension is greater than the load, then the muscle is going to continue to shorten.   </p>
<p>Now the time that it takes to shorten is going to increase as a load increases. Eventually, we can get to the point where we have reached our maximum load, which will then be a place where we have isometric tension.   </p>
<p>So, at the maximum load that our muscle can handle, we will not be able to shorten the muscle anymore because the tension will equal the load. And so that will be forming isometric tension because the muscle will not be getting shorter.   </p>
<p>Then eventually, we can get to loads that are greater than what our muscle can produce, and then in that case, even though your muscle is contracting, the load is greater than the tension that you can form. And so then, the muscle will actually become longer. It will be a lengthening contraction because the load exceeds the tension.   </p>
<p>In this part, the tension is greater than the load. And in this portion, the load is greater than the tension. Now, we have used lengthening contractions actually quite frequently, and we can set the tension of our muscle so that it will be less than the load, which allows us to lengthen our muscles. Then, that is going to allow us to do things like ease into a chair. So when you go to sit down in a chair, your quadricep muscles are going to actually get longer. They are going to have a lengthening contraction, but you set the tension of your quadricep such that it is going to be less than the load, which allows you to have a lengthening contraction, which is useful because if you just completely relaxed your quadriceps, you would just flop down in the chair.   </p>
<p>So, we use lengthening contractions to slowly lower something, for instance, just by setting the tension so that it is less than the load.   </p>
<p>There is also a relationship between the amount of tension we can produce and the length of the muscle. And this gets back to the sarcomeres. So when we have just a normal length of the muscle (in this blue range, and particularly in the middle of the blue range), that is when we have optimal matching up of the myosin in the actin. Where all the myosin heads can interact with the actin, and the actin is not starting to crowd itself.   </p>
<p>When we get to lengths that are extremely long, and we have overstretched the muscle. Then we get into a situation where not all of the myosin heads are interacting with actin, and so we cannot produce as much force because it is the number of myosin heads binding the actin that is going to allow us to determine the amount of force that we are going to be able to produce.   </p>
<p>In a similar way, if the muscle is under-stretched, then the actin is starting to get in the way of the opposing {??} that is coming from the other z line, and again that is not going to be helpful in terms of being able to contract any further.   </p>
<p>So the good news is that in typical physiological situations, which are going to be in this blue area, we have pretty close to maximal ability to produce tension. So it is only in cases of extreme injuries, like tearing a muscle away from the tendon or from the bone, or over-stretching the muscle in some way, where you would get into these situations. But since our muscles are, for the most part, bound by joints that keeps them in this range that allows for optimal tension.   </p>
<p><strong>Metabolism</strong><br />
We are going to switch gears and talk about metabolism and fuels because we know that one of the critical things you need for muscle contraction is going to be ATP. The question is what is the source going to be?   </p>
<p>In muscles, you are going to stockpile a molecule called creatine phosphate, which is able to quickly convert ADP to ATP with the help of the enzyme creatine kinase, which is just a single enzymatic step, so it is very rapid. And so, this is going to be if you are starting a very strenuous activity, and this is going to, in general, be the first source of energy.   </p>
<p>However, there is only enough creatine phosphate to last for a few seconds. So that is what is shown here, down here in this graph, where creatine phosphate can make ATP very rapidly. However, it only lasts 8 to 10 seconds. And so this would be the kind of the primary fuel that someone would use running the 100 meter dash.   </p>
<p>Then, anaerobic metabolism has time to get started, and that is going to convert glucose either from plain old glucose or from glycogen to lactic acid, and that is going to produce ATP. That is going to be somewhat efficient. Not as quick as producing ATP from creatine phosphate, but still pretty efficient. But, it is only going to be able to last for about a minute and a half before glucose and other factors are going to prevent it from continuing.   </p>
<p>And so this is going to be the primary fuel used, for instance, in the 400 meter dash, which is going to be longer, but still not what we would consider a very endurance-like activity. Once you got even longer and you are still putting out a lot of effort, then you are going to use oxidated or aerobic metabolism, which is when you are going to convert glucose or fatty acids all the way to CO2. And that is when you are going to be producing a lot of ATP per fuel molecule. But it is not super fast, so there is a limit to the number of moles of ATP per minute you can make with this process, so it is going to be even more slow than the an aerobic or the creatine phosphate.   </p>
<p>However the amount of resources, in terms of fats and glucose in the body. are going to be almost unlimited. And so that is why, you can run a marathon using primarily those source of fuels and that type of metabolism.<br />
Of course, our muscles fatigue, which in some ways is a good thing to prevent damage to the muscles, and there are several factors that can cause fatigue.   </p>
<p>One is just having all these action potentials along the muscle fiber can cause a buildup of extracellular potassium, which is then going to cause a persistent depolarization of the fiber, which can then make it less responsive.<br />
We can also have a buildup of lactic acid. For instance, when we are using that glycolytic metabolism which is then going to affect the change in pH, it is then going to affect some of the enzymes, such as the SR ATPase, that are required for contraction and relaxation.   </p>
<p>We can also have a build up of ADP and phosphate which is going to affect the myosin cross bridges and their binding to actin and how quickly they can cycle.   </p>
<p>And then eventually depending on which fuel source you are relying on you can also have a decrease in fuel sources particularly with endurance type activities.   </p>
<p>There are going to be three main types of skeletal muscle fibers that are going to differ based on the type of myosin ATPase that they contain. Whether it is a very fast ATPase that is going to allow for fast cycling of the myosin heads, or it is a slow ATPase.   </p>
<p>And then also they can differ in the predominant type of metabolism, whether it is going to be the glycolytic form that is just going to produce predominantly lactic acid, or whether it can rely more on the oxidative forms using fats and glucose to burn those fuels all the way to produce CO2.   </p>
<p><strong>3 Types of Fibers</strong><br />
The three types are that we have a slow-oxidative fiber. Oxidative, so we said since you have all this availability of fats or glucose, they are going to resist fatigue, and they are going to be the slow cycling type. So, these fiber types are going to be really important in muscles that are used for posture, for instance because they do not need to produce tons of force, but they need to be able to resist fatigue because we have used them all day long.   </p>
<p>Then there will be fast-oxidative fibers. Fast meaning that their myosin ATPase can cycle more quickly, but they can still resist fatigue. So you would use this, for instance, in some of the muscles used for walking. Where you can walk for a long time, and you do not need necessarily tons of force to be produced in a burst of energy.   </p>
<p>And then there is the fast-glycolytic fibers, which are going to have the fast ATPase, but just are going to rely predominantly on the glycolytic metabolism, which means they are not going to be for endurance.   </p>
<p>They are going to be able to produce a lot of force because they are often large in diameter, and they have the fast ATPase, but they are not going to last very long.   </p>
<p>So, most skeletal muscles are going to include all three types. It is just that some muscles will have a predominance of one type over the other.   </p>
<p>We are going to combine this idea of fiber types with our idea of motor units that we have already talked about. Remember a motor unit is the somatic nervous system neuron and the fibers that it innervates, which are all going to be in the same muscle but usually spread out throughout the muscle.  </p>
<p>It is going to include just one type of muscle fiber. And we will see that these fibers, depending on the type, can be of different diameters, and that they can have different size motor units with usually small motor units allowing for finer movements and larger motor units, since they are going to have more fibers that are often larger in diameter. Which means you have more myosin and actin acting. They can produce more tension. So there is an idea of recruitment.   </p>
<p>So we talked about one way that you can get more tension out of a muscle is to keep stimulating those fibers so that you can get more tension. But then the other thing is, since you have got multiple motor units in each muscle, you can recruit more motor units to increase the force that the muscle produces, and so often that is going to happen in a certain sequence where often slow-oxidative are going to be recruited first and they can last a long time.   </p>
<p>However, if more force is needed, then you can can recruit the fast oxidative fibers, which are going to produce (since they are often going to be larger in diameter which as we see by these orange fibers)  more force plus they have that fast myosin ATPase, and they still have a decent amount of endurance. They can resist fatigue.   </p>
<p>And then, if you still need more force, that is when you can recruit the fast-glycolytic fibers, which are again going to be large in diameter, have that fast ATPase. Unfortunately, they do not have that long duration of being able to contract.   </p>
<p>We are going to finish up just talking about muscle plasticity which is the changes that can occur, for instance, when you do different types of activities. So, for instance if you do weight training, then you are going to cause your muscle fibers to hypertrophy. So you are not necessarily going to increase the number of muscle fibers. You are going to increase the size of them. You are going to add more myofibrils to them, which means you are adding more actin and myosin that are in parallel, which means you are going to be able to build more force, and your muscles are going to get bigger.  </p>
<p>Endurance training is going to not necessarily lead to hypertrophy, instead it is going to lead to adaptations that are going to increase the resistance of fatigue to those fibers. So doing things like increasing the number of mitochondria in fibers or increasing the blood flow to fibers is going to increase their resistance to fatigue without necessarily causing the fibers to get larger. And so then again, as I have already mentioned, we are going to be talking about affecting the size of fibers, not really the number of fibers, with training.   </p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong><br />
So let's finish up.<br />
We talked about how we can have isotonic contractions.<br />
We can have isometric contractions.<br />
We can have lengthening contractions, and how those are going to be important for different tasks.<br />
We talked about how we have these different fiber types that have different myosin ATPases, or different metabolisms, and how that is going to affect the utility of these different types of motor units in the overall force generation of muscles.</p>
