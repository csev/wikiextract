<p>Hello everyone. Today we are going to talk about the senses. So we are going to start with the first of three videos that are going to talk about the senses. And during these, we are going to apply what we talked about in the nervous system to the sensory system. So we are going to start off in this first session talking about some general principles of the sensory system. And we are going to talk about somatosensation in the body. And then to finish up this first session, we are going to talk about the first of the special senses: vision. So the special senses are going to be where we have sensory receptors that are in a specific organ and whose input is going to go into cranial nerves in the head. So we are going to start off with vision. Then in the second session we are going to talk about hearing and the vestibular system. And then in the third session we are going to talk about the chemical senses of taste and smell.  </p>
<p><strong>General Principles</strong><br />
<ul><li> So let's just talk about some general principles, where, we are going to be talking about sensation, which is going to be sensory information that is going to reach the brain, and it is going to have information like, what the stimulus is, where on the body it is occurring, and how strong the stimulus is.<br />
</li><li> And so things that are going to be able to help us just figure that out are going to be which neurons are being activated and how frequently are they firing action potentials, and we will be talking more about this in the future.<br />
</li><li> Then there is also the idea of perception, which is going to be how we are going to interpret those sensations. And we are not going to talk too much about how perceptions happen, and a lot of that is not completely clear. Another thing to keep in mind is that adaptation also occurs and this is going to be when you are going to start to have a decrease in sensitivity after continued exposure to the stimulus. And so, this is going to happen more in some systems than others, but this property of a lot of our sensory systems as well as other issues with perception, allow us to weed out or to filter out a lot of the sensory information that we collect so that we can focus on the important information.<br />
</li><li> So for instance, if you are sitting down right now, you are probably not really feeling the chair on your body. Because you are just kind of, you have got some adaptation going on and you are also kind of ignoring it because it is not very important right now. Or you are not feeling the clothes on your body. And so in this way even though we are being constantly bombarded by sensory information and all of our senses almost continually.<br />
</li><li> We can focus on what is important, which is mostly the, the new changes that are happening in our environment. This is just a review, but to remind you that we are going to be talking about afferent systems and pathways coming into the central nervous system. And that it is going to start off with what you can call a receptor potential, which is going to be a graded potential. So, we are going to have these graded potentials which remember, are going to be additive and that if they are strong enough, then they will lead to an action potential, which will then be sent to signal in the central nervous system. So in one particular case that we are going to talk about later in the case of the sense of smell, the actual afferent neuron is the one that is sensing the odorants. But in most cases we are going to be talking about systems where we have got a certain receptor cell that is going to form graded potentials in the afferent neuron. And if they are strong enough, lead to action potentials that will be fed into the central nervous system. So we are going to talk a little about somatosensation, somato meaning body, and so these are going to be the sense of touch and pressure, for instance, and this is often going to be sensed by. mechanoreceptors which are going to be ion channels that are gated by stretch. And so we have many different qualities of touch that we can sense. We can sense different vibrations and deep pressure and light pressure. And so this These different modalities are of touch are accomplished by having different types of nerve endings and that is what shown here. These different nerve endings shown in the skin where we have some free nerve endings just the endings of axons. But then we also have several different kinds of encapsulated nerve endings. So these are the ends of the afferent neurons that are in a capsule and the location of this ending and the morphology of the capsule helps determine what specific sensory and touch modality the neuron responds to. Then we also have an important quality of, of being able to determine where our body is in space, which is called proprioception. And this is accomplished in large part by muscle stretch receptors which we will talk about when we talk about skeletal muscle as well as other mechanoreceptors that are in the skin that we have already mentioned as well as in joints and tendons.<br />
</li><li> And then also playing into this idea of where our bodies are in space of course is our. vision and our vestibular system, which gives us a sense of balance. And, we will be talking about those as well. We can also sense different temperatures, especially in the skin, and this is going to be occurring through thermoreceptors, which are going to be channels or receptors that can respond to certain temperatures are activated or opened at certain temperatures and so we have got some that respond to cold temperatures, some to hot temperatures and the interesting thing with some of these is that they can also respond to certain molecules. So some of the thermoreceptors that respond to heat also respond to capsaicin which is a molecule found in hot chili peppers, and so the reason why hot chili peppers taste hot is because they are acting on the same receptors that respond to heat and this is also true for menthol which is a very cooling causes a cooling feeling because menthol acts on the receptors that respond to cool temperatures. The last one we are going to talk about is pain which is going to be primarily free nerve endings that are going to contain channels called nociceptors, which are going to often sense chemicals that are released during damage. So if you get a wound, those compounds that were released are going to cause activation of these nociceptors and then lead you to the feeling of pain.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Vision</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Cornea and lens</strong>
<ul><li> So we are going to move now to the rest of the time talking about the special senses. The senses where there is going to be an organ that is responsible for that, detecting that stimulus. And we are going to start off with a vision. We are, obviously, going to be looking at the shape, the color and the movement of objects. And we are going to use the eye. And you can think of it in many ways like a camera where we are going to have to focus light into the eye, and it is going to be focused onto the retina, which is at the back of the eye. Because that is where photoreceptor cells are located that can detect the light. We also are going to focus the light using a lens, and we are going to also be able to control the amount of light coming into the eye using the pupil.<br />
</li><li> So when we use our vision, then we are going to be looking at light that is reflected from the objects that we are viewing. And it is going to enter the eye, be focused onto the retina and then the photoreceptors are going to then turn that stimulus of the light into electrical signal that is going to be a graded potential which is then going to be if it is strong enough lead to an action potential and then be delivered to the central nervous system. This is just to remind you that, when we see things, we are going to be seeing things in the visible light range. And that we are going to have different wavelengths of light that have different energies that are going to correspond to the colors that we see. So, we need to discuss the anatomy of the eye and we are going to start off talking about the cornea, which is going to, to be a clear covering of the eye and we will talk about it is role in focusing light in a minute. Then we also have a little chamber of fluid, called the aqueous humor that is going to be between the cornea and the lens, which is going to be also important for focusing light. And then behind the lens we are going to have the vitreous humor chamber which is going to be a gel-like substance that is filling the majority of the eyeball. And then at the back of the eye we have got the retina which is going to contain the photoreceptor cells that are going to detect the light.<br />
</li><li> So remember that when light is going to travel through air and then hit a different material, such as a tissue that is got a lot of water in it. And it as you have for the eye, then that is going to refract the light. it is going to bend the light. And so the first thing that the light is going to hit is going to be the cornea which is going to be a tissue so it is going to have a lot of water in it. And so that means that the cornea is going to do most of the refracting, and most of the focusing of the light onto the retina, is going to be due to the cornea. Then, the lens is certainly also going to play a part, in, the fine tuning of that focusing, and it is going to be important for being able to change the focus because when we are looking at things that are at a different distance from us. Okay? And we will be talking about that change in just a moment. So the cornea is going to be very important, as well as the lens to get that light focused onto the retina where the photoreceptor cells are located.<br />
</li><li> So the change of the shape of the lens is going to occur through muscles that are going around the lens, and then attached to it through these little fibers. And so, the ciliary muscles that are surrounding the lens will contract and relax. And when they are contracted, then they will, the circumference will be smaller. And so, that will allow the lens to be more rounded. Because the, the circumference of the ciliary muscles is going to be smaller. When the muscles are relaxed then the muscle fiber cells will be longer and so the circle, the circumference will be bigger And so actually when those muscles are relaxed is when there is more tension on the lens and then the lens is more flattened, okay? And so it is kind of anti-intuitive because when the muscles are relaxed is when you have got the tension on the lens, but that makes sense because when they are relaxed. The circumference of the circle surrounding the lens will be larger. And so there will be more force on those fibers pulling the lens more flat. So when the lens is more flattened, that is what allows you to focus on distant objects. And then when it is more rounded,. that is what lets you focus on near objects. So that is how the control the ciliary muscles is going to allow the lens to let us focus on things that are near or far. This is just I am not concerned with you knowing the details of this slide it the point is that there are going to be many layers of neurons in the retina.   </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Retina</strong><br />
<ul><li>  And that interestingly the photoreceptor cells the ones that are going to detect the light, the rods and the cones are at the back of the retina under all of those layers. So that the light which is shown right here with this orange arrow has to go through all the cells, to get to the photoreceptor cells. How is light sent? So that is what this slide is showing where in the photoreceptor cells, in the rods and the cones they are expressing opsin (rhodopsin?) proteins, or photo-pigment proteins that contain Retinal.<br />
</li><li> Retinal, which is a derivative of vitamin A and it is shown right here in this drawing. It is this little molecule that when light hits it, it causes a conformation change in retinal which then causes a conformational change in the photopigment protein and this change is then sent through a signal transduction pathway to then. Cause the conversion of cyclic GMP to GMP. So that means, when light hits this rod or cone. The amount of cyclic GMP is going to go down. And that is going to, then, close cyclic GMP gated channels. So at rest or in the dark, the cyclic GMP channels are open, letting lots of sodium and calcium into the cell, which means at rest, the photoreceptor cell is depolarized because you have basically got some sodium channels open and we know that means that you are going head towards the equilibrium potential of sodium. So, at rest you are depolarized. When light hits, those channels are closed which then means the cell becomes hyperpolarized with light and that hyperpolarization then leads to a reduction in neurotransmitter secretion by that cell which is then transduced to the further cells which is then sent to the central nervous system saying that there is light present. This is another view of this transduction of this signal where here we are showing we have rod cells and you can see we have got several rod cells converging. onto two different bipolar cells. And then the bipolar cells are going to converge onto a, a ganglion cell which is then going to send the signal to the brain. So the rods and the bipolar cells are going to generate graded potentials, and its going to be the ganglion cells which are going to generate action potentials that are going to lead to the central nervous system.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br />
<ul><li> So that is kind of chain of command in terms of how the signal is sent. One thing you notice is we have got six in this case rod cells feeding into only one ganglion cell. And so that means that you have got six different cells sending it, in, the signal to only one cell, and so that means that these rod cells, do not have very high resolution, and that is going to be in contrast to cones, where we are going to have one cone cell to one ganglion cell, so we are going to have higher resolution vision with cones.<br />
</li><li> So, this figure is showing that the cones and the rods have different specialties in terms of what they can detect, so, in low light, for instance star light, is where the amount of light is too low for the cones to be useful to detect. And so in very low light only the rods will be detecting the light. And since we just said the vision is going to be low resolution with rods, that means that in dark light we are going to have poor acuity, low resolution.<br />
</li><li> Once we get to normal daytime light or indoor light is where the cones are going to be working very well, and so we won't be relying on the rods, we will be relying on the cones and that is where we will have obviously, color vision because the cones are what we use for color vision. The rods are just going to be used for sensing light. And we are going to have very good resolution because we are going to have that one to one ratio of cone to ganglion cell. And so that will be important for the resolution that we can see at daytime in higher levels of light.<br />
</li><li> So let's just finish up by talking about how the cones do detect different colors. And so we have got three different types of cones. we have got blue cones. Green cones and red cones but yet even though we only have three different cones types we can sense all the colors of the spectrum that we can see and so this happens by a certain color will activate a certain. Type of cone in a certain way, and that is how we detect the color.<br />
</li><li> So one example would be yellow, which is shown here around 600 nanometers wavelength, where you can see when we are looking at something yellow , we know that it is yellow because it is activating the red cones a lot. Right, they are about 65% activated, and the green cones, not as much. So about twenty percent activated, and the blue cones not at all. So when we have that situation that we are looking at an object that is reflecting light, that is, that is highly activated the red cones, not very much Activating the, green cones, and not activating the blue cones at all, that is what we call yellow. And so through this combination, of, how much each of the cones is activated, we can cover the color spectrum.<br />
</li><li> This part of the figure at the bottom of the screen is kind of fun. If you stare at this yellow circle with the triangle for about thirty seconds, and then you go to stare at the square with the white background. You should be able to see a color around the square because you have fatigued the cones that sense yellow and so if you note what color That you see around the square after you have looked at the yellow circle, you should be able to kind of make sense of what I just told you in terms of which cones you fatigued when you were looking at the yellow. So it is something to try.<br />
</li><li> So, we have talked about how we are going to have, just in-sensory/g systems, which are going to be afferent systems, we are going to have some sort of stimulus, and it is going to convert that stimulus, no matter what it is, to a electrical signal, first degree of potential, and if that is strong enough. To action potentials.<br />
</li><li> So an important thing to remember as well is a certain afferent neuron is going to primarily sense one modality. So it might be touch or it might be temperature, but it is going to be sensing only one type of stimulus. And that is going to be important, so that if that neuron is firing, the nervous system can say, that is a touch neuron so that means touch is happening in that location.<br />
</li><li>Because the only language here is action potentials and so each neuron has to be assigned a certain modality that the central nervous system knows it is sensing, and then after that, it is just okay how frequently are action potential occurring. If action potentials are coming very rapidly and very frequently, then it must be a strong stimulus. So, you have got to keep in mind that our available language here is going to be for communicating these stimuli is going to be action potentials.<br />
</li><li> Then, we have talked briefly of just about somatosensation which is going to be just throughout the body of touch, pressure, vibration, as well as the things that are going to be important for proprioception, and then we talked about how the visual system is going to detect the shape and color of objects, even when they are moving, and how this is going to lead to great potentials and then action.</p>
