<ul>
<li>This is our last session on just the nervous system in general and we are going to talk about how it is organized to accomplish specific tasks. And then in later sessions, we are going to talk about more specific examples such as the senses. So right now, we are going to be talking more about just, in general, how the nervous system is organized.  </li>
<li>And so in general, what the nervous system is going to do is that it is going to sense different things. And we will talk about what some of those things are in a minute. And this is going to be through what we call an afferent neuron. This is a neuron that is bringing information into the nervous system. So, I remember “a” is at the beginning of the alphabet and so it is what is coming in first. Afferent starts with “a” and then, the cell body of this neuron is going to be sitting outside of the central nervous system.  </li>
<li>So, in the peripheral nervous system, often really close to the spinal cord, it is going to synapse with neurons that are in the central nervous system.  </li>
<li>So, (and remember, the central nervous system is going to be the brain and the spinal cord), so these neurons are going to be the ones that integrate the information coming in from the afferent neurons to decide what the appropriate response should be. That response is going to come from the efferent neuron, whose cell body is going to be sitting in the central nervous system, but then who is going to send its axon out into the periphery to control the muscle or the gland or whatever needs to be controlled by the system.  </li>
<li>So, we have got the central nervous system, which is the spinal cord and brain, that is going to take the information coming out from the periphery, decide what to do, and then that information goes out through the efferent system that is going away to cause the proper response to the stimulus.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sensory Inputs</strong><br />
<ul><li> So, let's talk about some of the sensory inputs that we could be talking about. And we will talk more about this in the sensory lecture session as well. So, we, of course, have the five senses that you are used to hearing about where we have got vision and hearing and balance and taste and smell. So, those are all obviously very important.<br />
</li><li> We also have somatosensation. So, these are going to be things like touch and pressure and temperature, as well as proprioception which is going to be a type of somatosensation which allows you to know where your body is in space without actually looking. So, this is going to be knowing this is going to come from things like stretch that allows you to know where your body is in space.<br />
</li><li> Then, the other thing to keep in mind is that we also have visceral stimuli that the nervous system is going to keep track of. And we will, again, be talking about these when we talk about other organ systems of the body where we have monitoring of the pH of the blood or of blood pressure or of blood glucose levels.<br />
</li><li> And so again, it is going to be stimuli that these, that the nervous system is going to have to keep track of in order to maintain homeostasis. This is another view, again, we have got the afferent neurons coming in, sensing the things that we just discussed. We got the CNS, the central nervous system that is integrating that information.   </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Efferent Systems</strong><br />
<ul><li> And then we have got several different types of efferent systems. And so, one system is called the somatic system and we will be hearing about this several sessions from now. The somatic nervous system is going to be what controls skeletal muscle. So, a lot of this is going to be controlling voluntary actions such as just normal skeletal muscle movement. So, that is one type of efferent nervous system.<br />
</li><li> Then, the other one is the autonomic nervous system, which again, is going to cause responses and this is going to be through three different systems.<br />
</li><li> So, there is the enteric system, which is going to be present in the digestive tract and is going to be, in many ways, its own contained nervous system. However, it can still be modulated and affected by the other branches of the autonomic nervous system. So, you’ll be hearing somewhat about that during the digestive system sessions.<br />
</li><li> But then, the other two main portions of the autonomic nervous system, they are going to be very important, are the parasympathetic system and the sympathetic system, which are going to control many of the organs of the body.<br />
</li><li> I also want to point out that the circuitry between some of these systems is different. And we will talk about this again later, but the somatic nervous system that is controlling skeletal muscle is going to be a single neuron system, where the cell body of the neuron is going to be sitting in the central nervous system and very often, this is going to be specifically in the spinal cord. And so, that one neuron is going to then send its axon (and this is where we said axons can be very long) all the way to the actual muscle that the neuron needs to control. And so, that is just a single cell system where you go from the central nervous system, all the way to the muscle to control that skeletal muscle. And we will be talking about this in the future.<br />
</li><li> The autonomic nervous system has two neurons in series, where the first neuron, its cell body is sitting in the central nervous system. So, this is going to be sitting either in the spinal cord for most of the body or the brain stem for the head. And then, it is going to be send out an axon that is going to then synapse with the second neuron in the system. And this is going to occur in a ganglion. And a ganglion is a group of cell bodies of neurons that is outside of the central nervous system. And so, this ganglion is then going to be where the second neuronal cell body sits and then it is going to send out its axon, to the gland or the organ that is then going to be controlled. This is just another more detailed picture of these same two systems and again, like in the previous session, we are going to be talking about some of these molecules again when we are talking about some of these organ systems.<br />
</li><li> So, the somatic nervous system, we said, are going to have a single neuron coming from the central nervous system out to the periphery. And in this case, we are going to have a cholinergic synapse so we are going to have acetylcholine released. And then, the acetylcholine is going to bind nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the skeletal muscle.<br />
</li><li> So, we will be talking about that when we talk about skeletal muscle in the somatic nervous system. Remember, in the autonomic nervous system, we said we are going to have two neurons in series. And so, in both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems, we are going to have acetylcholine released by the first neuron, and then that is going to be bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the second neuron.<br />
</li><li> Then we are going to have a different types of acetylcholine receptors on the target for the parasympathetic nervous system. So, parasympathetic neurons, the second neuron in the chain is again going to release acetylcholine, but then it is going to bind muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on the target organ.<br />
</li><li> In the sympathetic division, the second neuron is going to release norepinephrine or epinephrine. And then, that is going to bind it to the adrenergic receptors that we talked about in the previous session. That are sitting on the organ that needs to be controlled. And then we also have, with the sympathetic nervous system, the special case of the inner part of the adrenal gland, which Dr. Jakoi will talk to you about later in the course, where we are going to have cells that are going to produce epinephrine and norepinephrine, but then put it into the blood so that it can circulate throughout the body and then affect many organs by again, binding adrenergic receptors.<br />
</li><li> So, keep this in mind as we are talking about the different organ systems and how they are controlled by the nervous system because this is the basis of that control, the circuitry behind that control.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>The Autonomic Nervous System: sympathetic and parasympathetic</strong><br />
<ul><li> We are going to finish up just talking a little bit about the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, where most organs of the body are going to be controlled by both systems, which seems like it would be a little confusing for these organs who are trying to be controlled by two different systems.<br />
</li><li> The sympathetic system is going to be more active during times when we need to fight or flight. So, when you have got that adrenaline rushing, then the sympathetic nervous system is going to be responsible for controlling many organs of the body and it is going to cause responses such as dilating of the pupils and increasing heart rate.<br />
</li><li> Whereas, the parasympathetic nervous system is going to be more activated during times of rest and digestion. So it will decrease heart rate and increase processes such as digestion.<br />
</li><li> So, the important thing to keep in mind with these two systems is that it is very rare for only one of the systems to be activated and for the other one to be completely shutdown. And so, you can think of them as a gas pedal and a brake on a car. Whereas, technically, you could drive a car with only a gas pedal. You would just have to let up the gas for a long time and then coast to eventually stop. But you can have such wonderful and exquisite control of a car because you have both a gas pedal and a brake.<br />
</li><li> And so, that is why we have these two systems: the sympathetic system which is going to activate or depress a certain organ, and the parasympathetic system that is going to do the opposite to the organ. And that allows us to have exquisite control of these organs in exactly how much they are activated because we have got both a gas pedal and a brake. And so, we will be talking about these organs in the future and how they are controlled by both of these systems.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Wrap-up</strong><br />
<ul><li> So, just to wrap up, we have talked about how we have got the central nervous system, which is going to be the spinal cord and the brain and then we are going to have the nerves which are going to be bundles of axons in the peripheral nervous system as well as the ganglia that are going to be collections of cell bodies in the peripheral nervous system.<br />
</li><li> And then, we talked about how we are going to have these reflexes which we are going to be talking much more about where we get a stimulus and then the central nervous system is going to decide how to respond to it.<br />
</li><li> And then, the signal is going to go through the peripheral nervous system to change and cause the needed response to that sensory input. So, this is going to be a reflex arc.<br />
</li><li> Then, we also talked about how we are going to control so many of our organs and muscles through the somatic nervous system that is going to control skeletal muscle, and then the autonomic nervous system where we have the enteric nervous system for the digestive tract which can still be influenced by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system.<br />
</li><li> And then, we have the sympathetic nervous system that is going to be very active during fight or flight situations, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which is going to be more active when we are resting and digesting. And having that brake and gas pedal are going to be important in having very fine control over our organs.</p>
