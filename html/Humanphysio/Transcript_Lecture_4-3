<p>Greetings. I just wanted to have a few more words about the cardiac performance. The last time we met, we were talking about how cardiac output is equal to stroke volume times heart rate. And today, we want to define and calculate the ejection fraction of the heart, that is the efficiency of the heart. We also want to discuss the Frank-Starling relationship in terms of venous return and cardiac output. And thirdly, we want to explain the effects of the sympathetic stimulation on cardiac output. So cardiac output then is the volume of blood that is pumped per minute from the ventricles. It is equal to the stroke volume times the heart rate. And typically, we have 72 beats per minute in a normal person and the stroke volume is 70 milliliters. So cardiac output is 5 liters per minute. We do have instances where an individual has a heart rate which is much slower than 70 beats per minute. For instance, if you are a well-trained athlete, you could have 50, even 35 beats per minute. So, how does the body actually deal with that? When we have very low heart rates, if we decrease the heart rate, that means that ___ and the cardiovascular output is 5 liters per minute, we have to increase stroke volume. So the well-trained athlete actually has a slightly larger heart, and the heart has very strong muscle walls which enables it to contract  very strongly, and can put out a larger stroke volume per beat. We often want to talk about the efficiency of the heart, and the efficiency of the heart is called the ejection fraction. The ejection fraction is calculated by the stroke volume divided by the end diastolic volume times 100. In a normal person, when we have 70 mils, which is going to be our stroke volume, and we have an end diastolic volume that is something like about 140 milliliters, then the ejection fraction is going to be 50%. If we have an individual where the ejection fraction now is much larger, say our athlete, then that individual will have a larger end diastolic volume. So that the ejection fraction actually can still stay at 50% and perhaps even larger. An ejection fraction less than 50% starts to indicate that we have a weak heart and a heart that is not very efficient. So let's look at the PV loops of two hearts. So, we have two hearts. One is the PV loop is A. And the second, the PV loop is B. They're both on the same cardiac function curve and that is what's shown here. So we have a pressure versus volume, the PV loop. The stroke volume of loop A and B are equal, they're both 40 milliliters. But what's the ejection fraction of loop A? The end-diastolic volume is 90, so we have 40 milliliters divided by 90 milliliters times 100, so the ejection fraction is about 48%. If we look at loop A, we see that the that the stroke volume is also 40 mils, but that the, that the end-diastolic volume is 140. So, an end-diastolic volume of 140, 10 times a 100, were actually coming out to an ejection fraction that is more like about 28%. So, a bigger heart then is not necessarily a better heart, but that sometimes, the body does in fact increase the size of the heart in order to compensate for a low cardiac output. So, let's look at this a little bit in more depth. Here, we've diagrammed the stroke volume versus the ventricular end-diastolic volume or EDV. So, the stroke volume then is on our y-axis, the x-axis is the end-diastolic volume. If we start with the heart that is 120 milliliters, we see that the stroke volume is about 80. If I add more volume to that same heart, I can make the end-diastolic volume, I can fill the heart to an end-diastolic volume of 200, and now my stroke volume is a 105. So by increasing the fill of the heart, we actually stretch the cardiac myocytes. By stretching the cardiac myocytes, they will contract and expel the amount of fill that we gave to the heart. So increased fill gives us increased stroke volume. This is takes us back to that idea from the Frank-Starling law, which is that if you stretch the cardiac myocyte, you can get a better squeeze. So venous return in the heart is still ____, or the filling of the ventricle, and this is related to preload. We increase preload to get a better contraction from the heart to get a better stroke volume. How do we increase venous return? Well, the easiest way to think about this is when you are running, for instance. So if we're running, then we have our skeletal muscles working, and as the skeletal muscles are working, they are pressing against the blood vessels which are perfusing that entire area. By doing so, they push the blood then out from the skeletal muscle back  toward the heart, and this is called the skeletal muscle pump. So this is our first way of increasing venous return or by increasing the filling of the ventricle. The second is the respiratory pump and that simply means that, as you are running, you are taking deeper breaths. And by taking deeper breaths, you are lowering the pressure within the thoracic cavity, and that is allowing the blood to move back to the heart faster. So this is then the inspiratory or respiratory pump. The third way is that we can increase the blood volume and this you're all familiar with, and they're effective blood doping. In blood doping, you actually take some blood from an individual a month before the race, and then, just before the race, you give back that same liter of blood. Instead of having 5 liters within the system, you may now have an extra 500 or an extra liter of blood. This is now going to help in delivering oxygen to the tissues, and so, it has a beneficial effect for the runner because he's having more oxygen being delivered. But it also is as the runner starts to sweat, he will lose volume and as he's losing volume, then the hematocrit will increase. That is the amount of blood cells within a specific volume of blood will increase. This is an increase in viscosity, and now the heart has to push against blood that has higher viscosity and this is afterload. This is a negative effect of blood doping. So increasing blood volume is not done very frequently, and in fact, it's illegal among most athletic events. And the last way that we can increase the venous return is by vasoconstriction. And vasoconstriction is where we increase sympathetic drive to the skeletal muscle. They act on the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors and cause vasoconstriction. The vasoconstriction in the veins are...the smooth muscle is longitudinally oriented along the axis of the vein. And so, it's allowing us to have peristalsis of the blood and movement of the blood back to the heart[INAUDIBLE]. So we have four ways, then, that we can increase venous return. Now, there is another way that you can increase the contractility of the heart, and that is through the sympathetic drive. So we said that the sympathetic drive, then, will increase the resistance within the system and will allow the blood to move back faster to the heart. The sympathetic drive actually changes the phenotype of the heart itself and that is what's shown here. So, here again, we have stroke volume, diastolic versus the end-diastolic volume. Excuse me. We have a heart which is on the green line. This is going to be our normal resting heart. This is our normal cardiac function curve. The heart has an end-diastolic volume of 125 milliliters and it has a stroke volume that is about 60. If we give a stimulation to the heart (that is a sympathetic stimulation to the heart or norepinephrine is delivered to the heart), we see that it moves from this cardiac function curve to this one. So it, plus with the sympathetic stimulation. We then are moving to a higher cardiac function curve. Now, a heart with an end-diastolic volume of 125 milliliters is giving us a stroke volume of 90. We've increased the stroke volume once, because of the venous return, but also the contractility of cardiac myocytes increased. And we increased then the contractility by increasing the off rate of calcium from troponin, so that the cardiac myocytes, the myofibrils, can relax faster. We also have an uptake of calcium into the SR through the calcium ATPase, and this is now sped up, so we have a faster off rate from the myofibrils and a faster removal of calcium from the cytoplasm. So with the calcium transient then is faster, we can relax faster and we also are increasing the dumping of calcium through the ryanodine channel. So the entire calcium transient is working faster within these cells. So, sympathetic drive increases heart rate, but sympathetic drive also affects stroke volume and it does so by affecting the contractility of the heart directly. So what are our general concepts? So the volume of the blood that is ejected with each beat is called the stroke volume and that is the first concept. The second is that the sum of the stroke volumes that is ejected in one minute is called the cardiac output. The third is that our ejection fraction is the percentage of blood that is pumped from the heart in each beat. Four, the cardiac output increases with increased fill of the ventricles, so we've increased venous return, we're increasing the stretch of the cardiac myocyte, or we can increase it through a sympathetic drive. See you next time.</p>
