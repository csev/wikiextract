<p>Greetings.  So, today we're going to talk about the  hypothalamus pituitary-adrenal axis.  This is the axis that governs your  response to stress.  And the stress can be psychological  stress or it could be physical stress, such as trauma, surgery or some type of  internal problem where you are  dehydrated, for instance.  So this particular axis is  going to get the body ready for what's  known as fight or flight response, and it's going to work with the  sympathetic nervous system to to mobilize  fuel.  The other thing that this axis does is  that one of the hormones that's secreted  from the axis is able to dampen the  immune system.  And so, this particular hormone, cortisol, is used pharmacologically by  the medical field to dampen  inflammation or to prevent some type of  an immune reaction.  So, we're going to talk about then this  complex organ.  So, the adrenal gland is  what's shown here.  They're fairly small organs.  They're sitting on top of the kidneys,  and so you have two adrenals as you have  two kidneys in your body.  The adrenal gland itself has a connective tissue capsule that surrounds  the entire gland.  And the gland has no ducts because this  is an endocrine gland.  The gland itself is going to be divided  into two zones.  The outermost zone is called the cortex,  and it's going to secrete steroid  hormones.  And we will have three types of steroid  hormones coming from this region.  The inner portion of the gland, which is  shown here, is called the medulla.  This is an area which is going to be  secreting tyrosine derivatives.  And these are epinephrine and  norepinephrine.  And in humans, it's predominantly  epinephrine.  Now as we go through this  particular lecture, what  I first want to do is concentrate on the  hormones that are coming from the cortex,  then we'll very briefly talk about  the hormones that are coming from the  medulla, and then how the hormones from  the cortex and the medulla actually work  in a synergistic manner.  </p>
<p><strong>hormones from the cortex</strong><br />
The hormones from the cortex then, as  I've said, are steroids which means that they're insoluble in  plasma so that they are delivered to  the target cells by carriers.  And secondly, they are able to pass  through plasma membranes and so they cannot be stored within the  tissue that's generating them.  So, these are hormones that are going to  be synthesized on demand.  And thirdly, because they can pass  through plasma membranes, are insoluble  and lipid, then they have receptors which  are found within the inside  the target cells.  And these receptors are going to be what  we call transcription factors.  These are proteins that bind  to DNA and will cause the specific gene  to be made into RNA.  And then that RNA will be made into  protein.  And so, that whole process takes several  minutes, at least 30 minutes, to make a  new protein.  So, the response to these hormones will  be slow.  First, we have to synthesize them.  Then, we have to deliver them by the  blood, have them pulled off of their  carriers, and then they have to change  transcription of the gene,  that is to change the type of proteins  that will be expressed within these  cells.  So, this is going to be a slow response, but the response will be long  lasting because we've changed proteins  within the target cell.<br />
The cortex itself is going to be  secreting three separate steroid  hormones.  And as you can see here,  this cortex is divided into three zones.  In the first zone, we are secreting  aldosterone.  in the second zone, we're going to  secrete cortisol.  And in the third zone, it's  secreting something which is called DHEA  for our purposes, and this is a weak  androgen.  So, it's a sex steroid sex hormone, which  is a very weak male, sex hormone.  The way to remember what these hormones  are doing in the body is to remember that  aldosterone is going to be affecting the  salt balances of the body, that cortisol  is going to be affecting sugar balances  in the body, and DHEA is  affecting your secondary sex characteristics.  So, it's salt, sugar, and sex.      </p>
<p><strong>Aldosterone</strong><br />
Alright, so let's talk about then, this  first hormone which is  aldosterone.  Now, aldosterone is not going to be  regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary  axis.  Aldosterone is secreted by zone  one from the adrenal cortex in response  to two separate stimuli.<br />
The first stimulus is when we have an  increase in blood potassium  concentration.  As blood potassium concentration rises,  aldosterone will be secreted by the  adrenal gland.  Aldosterone works on the kidney to cause  re-absorption of sodium and water from  the presumptive urine space back into the  blood.  And in exchange, it is causing the  potassium to move from the blood into the  urine space.  So, we're removing potassium from blood,  and we're moving sodium and water back  into the blood from the urine  space.  This simply means that we're  going to increase the excretion of  potassium in the urine.  And this will correct, then our high or  elevated potassium levels in the  blood.<br />
The second signal that works to trigger  the release of aldosterone from the  adrenal is Angiotensin II.  This is a vasoconstrictor that is  released by the body in response to low  blood pressure.  So, low blood volume or low blood  pressure is sensed by the kidney, and the  kidney then will trigger a cascade of  events which lead to an elevation in  angiotensin II, this very potent  vasoconstrictor.  This vasoconstrictor will cause the  adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone.  And again, aldosterone is going to work  on the kidney tubules and we're going to  have a reabsorption of sodium and water.  So, we're going to move sodium and water  back into the body, and in exchange, we  will lose potassium into the urine.  By moving sodium and water back into the  body, then we effectively are going to  increase the blood pressure because we  are increasing blood volume.  Again, these two signals are  independent of a hypothalamus-pituitary  axis and the aldosterone is not going to  be regulated by the  hypothalamus-pituitary axis.       </p>
<p><strong>Cortisol</strong><br />
The second hormone that we want to talk  about is cortisol.  That's the one that's going to govern our  sugar level.  So, the cortisol is also called  glucocorticoid.  Cortisol is the dominant glucocorticoid  in humans.  Cortisol is going to be regulated by the  hypothalamus pituitary axis and that's  what's shown here.  So, we have then, a circadian rhythm and  pulsatility in secretion because the  hypothalamus pituitary axis is  governing the release of cortisol  from the adrenal gland.  So, the pulsatility occurs throughout the  day, and then in late sleep, that is,  just before you awake in the mornings,  then cortisol levels will rise.  And so the highest amplitude of cortisol is going to be  very early just before you're waking up  early in the morning.  And then, cortisol falls during the day  to about half maximum at about 4 o' clock  in the afternoon. So cortisol, then, has the circadian peak,  but in addition to that, the cortisol can increase in response to  stress.  And the increase is superimposed on the  circadian rhythm.  So, if we have an individual who's highly  stressed, that individual may be  secreting cortisol at this  level.  So the circadian rhythm is  maintained, but we just have a higher  amplitude in the secretion of cortisol.  Cortisol is going to be mobilizing fuel  sources, and we're going to talk  about that in just a few minutes.  </p>
<p><strong>Regulation of Cortisol</strong><br />
So, let's look at the actual regulation of cortisol.  This is, as I said, by the hypothalamus  pituitary axis.  In this particular case, I've diagrammed  low plasma glucose.  So, this is going to be our stressor  for this axis.  That's going to be perceived by the  hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus secretes this  hormone, this small peptide,  neuropeptide, which is CRH or corticotropin. Corticotropin works on the anterior  pituitary to  cause it to secrete ACTH, with is  adrenocorticotropin.  And the ACTH, in turn, works on  the adrenal cortex in that zone 2, which  is going to secrete, then, cortisol.  Cortisol is released into the blood,  is synthesised on demand, is released  into the blood, it binds to carrier, and  then is delivered to the target tissues  within the body.  And cortisol is going to work on  essentially all cells of the  body, and we'll talk about that in just a  few minutes.  In addition, cortisol itself mediates the  long axis negative feedback loop to both  the anterior pituitary to govern the  levels of ACTH and to the hypothalamus to  govern the levels of CRH.  So, this is the normal complex negative  feedback loop that we've always seen with  the hypothalamus pituitary axis.  ACTH can also mediate a negative  feedback loop and this is our short  negative feedback loop which is then  also dampening the release of CRH from  the hypothalamus.  And of course, CRH can mediate the ultra  short, which is a paracrine loop, and  that's what's shown here.  So, that's the ultra short negative  feedback loop.  When this axis is first  matured within the body, it takes about  the first one whole year of life before  this axis is working under normal  conditions.  But once it's matured, then if cortisol  is depressed by giving  pharmacological doses to an individual,  the endogenous axis can be depressed.  And then when you remove the  drug, the cortisol that was being giving  exogenously, this axis takes about four  to six weeks to come back on board.  So, the axis can be suppressed by giving  cortisol as a drug.  And then it takes a long time for it to  actually come back, and to be functioning  in its normal manner.  And so, therefore, individuals who are  put on cortisol are always weened off the  drug in a very slow manner.<br />
The other thing about this axis is that  ACTH is going to increase the secretion  of DHEA, which we said was our weak  androgen.  And this weak androgen if we have high  levels of ACTH and we have high levels of  cortisol, we will have high levels of  DHEA.  If we have a situation where we have low  levels of cortisol, then ACTH will rise  and DHEA will rise, even though the  cortisol levels are low.  So, this synthesis Of DHEA is independent  of cortisol synthesis, but they're both  being driven by ACTH.  DHEA does not mediate a negative feedback  loop to ACTH or to CRH.  So, DHEA can rise under certain  conditions, but it will not mediate a  negative feedback loop.  Why is this important?  There are certain conditions where you  may have an insufficiency of cortisol.  The individual is not able to synthesize  cortisol because specific enzymes are  missing.  And under these conditions, ACTH will  rise, DHEA will rise.  If this individual is a male, it doesn't  make much of of a difference in the  phenotype, because as male hormone it's a very weak androgen.  And so the maleness of the individual  doesn't really change.  But if the individual is a female, then  the amount of male hormone, that is the  amount of DHEA can be sufficient to  masculinize the female.  So, the female is then virilized.  So, under certain conditions then, when  we cannot make cortisol, we can make  excess amounts of DHEA and virilize the  individual if the individual is a female.      </p>
<p><strong>Metabolic Effects of Cortisol</strong><br />
So, what are these metabolic  effects then of cortisol itself?  As I said, cortisol is going to mobilize  fuel sources and that's to raise blood  glucose.  And what it's doing is it's moving fuel  from very long-lasting sources, such as,  the muscle, bone fat, and it's degrading  those tissues to mobilize it into a  plasma glucose and also into glycogen.  So, the liver is going to be making  glycogen as well as glucose.  Glycogen is a very labile form of a  stored fuel.  In addition to that, cortisol is going to  cause the beer belly fat to grow.  This, all the fat that's found in the  periphery, that is on your arms and then  on the legs.  It's going to be degraded by cortisol.  But the fat then is going to be  deposited into the beer belly region and  this is called omental fat.  And in this area, it's a very labile fat.  It's a different type of fat than what  you find within your arms and  within your legs, for instance.  So, it's mobilizing fuel and it's putting  the fuel into much more labile storage forms.  Cortisol itself has made major  pharmacological effects.  And as I said, the first is that it is  anti-inflammatory and can suppress the  immune response.  Individuals who are being treated for  chemotherapy, for instance, are often  given cortisol.  And this is to dampen the immune  response, so that it doesn't attack the  tissues of the body.  Secondly, cortisol will degrade bone,  muscle, peripheral fat.  Essentially, it's a very  catabolic hormone.  So, it's going to degrade all of these  tissues and mobilize these tissues so  that we could then raise plasma glucose  levels.  And thirdly, cortisol directly inhibits  the growth hormone thyroid hormone  actions, insulin, and sex hormones at  their target tissues.  So, it has profound effects upon the  body, not only to mobilize fuels, but it  also effects other other  hypothalamus, pituitary axes.       </p>
<p><strong>Major Adrenal Pathologies</strong><br />
What are some of the pathologies?  I would like to just talk about two  major adrenal pathologies.  The first one is hyposecretion.  So, this is where we have an  insufficiency of hormone.  In this particular particular disease,  called Addison's disease, we have an  insufficiency of aldosterone and  of cortisol.  Because in this particular disease, the  entire adrenal cortex is being degraded.  This is an autoimmune disease where the  body is attacking the cells of the  adrenal cortex.  The phenotype of these individuals is  that they will have low blood pressure.  They will have low concentrations of  sodium within the blood and they're  going to have very high concentrations of  potassium.  So, why is this an important point?  With the high concentrations of  potassium, if potassium concentrations  get too high, you can affect the resting  membrane potentials of tissues which  are electrically  active, such as, neurons and the heart  and skeletal muscle.  And you can cause profound  hyperexcitability within the individual  by having the potassium  levels moving the threshold.  That is moving the resting membrane  potential towards threshold.  Under these conditions, the lethal this  actually can become a lethal addition  if the amount of potassium in the blood  rises too high.  So the problem is predominantly  the missing aldosterone.  But we also have a problem with fuel and  that is that the cortisol itself is  missing.  And so, we're going to have an inability  to mobilize fuel and to mobilize glucose  in order to respond to stress.  So, I want you predict what the level of  ACTH in the blood would be.  What do you think?  That's right.  Because cortisol is decreased in  these individuals, ACTH is going to be  very high.  The negative feedback to the pituitary is missing, and so the ACTH levels will rise in the  blood.  Now the second condition that we want to  consider is the hypersecretion, but  this is going to be hypersecretion of  cortisol alone.  And this is due to an excess of ACTH.  And the disease that we're talking about  is Cushing's disease.  Cortisol rises and, of course, our DHEA  will rise because ACTH is at very high  levels.  Under these conditions, the individual  will have hyperglycemia, high  blood glucose levels.  There will, again, be wasting of the  muscle, of bone, of fat, but we're  going to increase our beer belly fat.  And the individual also can form  what's called a moon face.  That is a very rounded face because we  get deposits of fat within  the face.  So, these individuals then are moving  their fuel sources to very laid  out deposits of glycogen and to the  omental fat or the beer-belly fat, under  the drive of cortisol.  In order to test   how this axis is misbehaving, then  you can give a drug called dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone inhibits the synthesis of  ACTH from the pituitary.  If you give dexamethasone and then wait  60 minutes, the ACTH levels should fall.  And in response to a falling ACTH levels,  we should then also see a fall in  cortisol, and obviously, a fall in DHEA.  So, this is called a suppression test.  And the dexamethasone is used to find  out whether or not the tumor   that's causing excess expression of or  synthesis of ACTH is present within the  pituitary.  Alright.       </p>
<p><strong>The Adrenal Medulla</strong><br />
In this last few minutes, I want to talk  about the medulla.  So, we're going to switch gears slightly.  Remember, I told you that the medulla is  going to be secreting a tyrosine  derivative.  The tyrosine derivative is predominately  epinephrine, but it can also be secreting  norepinephrine.  In the human, it's  predominantly epinephrine.  It's like an 80 to one 80 to 20 ratio.  So, this is the adrenal medulla.  The adrenal medulla is innervated by the  sympathetic nervous system and when we  increase the activity of the sympathetic  nervous system secretion from the adrenal  medulla increases.  And we will have a rise in  circulating levels of of epinephrine.  Epinephrine is a derivative tyrosine.  It's soluble in water.  It does not have to be bound to a  carrier, has very short half-lifes, and  it's cleared from the body very quickly.  Epinephrine, you have an increase in  the sympathetic drive when you have an  increase in stress.  And an increase in stress, then the  epinephrine feeds back and modulates  the perception of stress.  This particular hormone is going to be  working in conjunction with cortisol.  And so, the two pieces are actually  working together, the two parts of the  adrenal gland are going to be  working together to govern the  response to stress.  And that's what's shown here.  So, our metabolism in stress.  So, let's say that we have a situation  where our plasma glucose levels are  falling.  The drop in plasma glucose  level is perceived as stress.  This will cause the hypothalamus to  secrete our CRH.  It works on the corticotrophs of the  pituitary to secrete ACTH and that causes  an increase in cortisol.  The cortisol works on fat to degrade the  fat.  And while degrading the fat, we will,  then, release free fatty acids and  glycerol.  And they're delivered to the liver, and  plasma glucose levels will rise.  In addition, the sympathetic nervous  system is activated because this is a  stressful condition.  And the sympathetic innervation to the  medulla causes an increase in  epinephrine.  Epinephrine is circulating within the  blood and its target is fat.  It causes lipolysis of fat, the breakdown  of fat, just like we had the cortisol.  Again, free fatty acids and glycerol are  then, dumped into the blood and it's  delivered to the liver, which converts  this into glucose.<br />
In addition to these 2 hormones, that is  cortisol and epinephrine, the sympathetic  nervous system also acts on the pancreas.  And this is an axis that we  haven't yet discussed.  But, what it is that, in your  pancreas, there are two cells which are  endocrine cells.  One, which is called beta.  And these cells secrete insulin and the  other cell, which is the alpha cell,  secretes glucagon.  The sympathetic nervous system directly  inhibits the secretion of insulin.  And in the absence of insulin, glucagon  secretion is increased.  So, we have a third hormone that, that  rises when we have a stressful situation.  So, we have epinephrine.  We have cortisol and we have glucagon.  Glucagon also works on the liver to cause  an increase in plasma glucose.  And the three hormones together, that is  ephinephrin, cortisol, and glucagon,  together make a very large rise in plasma  glucose levels.  And this is called synergy because the  rise is bigger than what each  of these individual hormones can do by  itself.  So, we have a synergistic action of three  hormones in response to stress and that  is two from the adrenal and one from the  pancreas.       </p>
<p><strong>General Concepts</strong><br />
So, what are our general concepts?<br />
So, the first is is that our adrenal  glands are comprised of two glands that  are regulated separately and they produce  different hormones.  The cortex produces steroid hormones and  the first of these is aldosterone.  And aldosterone governs the balance of  sodium and potassium within the blood, as  well as the blood volume.<br />
The second is cortisol.  And cortisol is a very catabolic hormone.  It's going to degrade all tissues,  including bone within the body to  increase plasma glucose levels.  It's mobilizing fuel sources.<br />
And the third is that we have a very  weak androgen called DHEA, which affects  secondary sex traits,  and in particularly in the female.  In the male, as I said, they  have testosterone and they have androgens  which are stronger male sex hormones.  And so the DHEA effects are not as  dramatic.<br />
The adrenal medulla secretes  primarily epinephrine and the epinephrine, and  acts to increase oxygen to the tissues.  That is, epinephrine will bind to  adrenergic receptors, just like  norepinephrine binds to adrenergic  receptors.  So, it binds the beta-2s in the lung.  So, it causes a dilation or an opening of  the airways within the lung, so that we  can get air into the lung easier.  Secondly, it will mobilize fuel, and then  this is going to degrade lipid, so we're  going to have a higher amount of  plasma glucose levels.  And importantly, it's going to inhibit  insulin secretion.  So, the insulin is not going to be taking  the glucose that we're trying to  increase in the plasma and stuffing it  into the skeletal muscle to  store back into fat, into skeletal  muscle.  And instead, the insulin is going to  be absent and we're going to have  glucagon.  So, we're going to have a rise in plasma  glucose levels.  The net effect of the adrenal hormones,  that is cortisol and epinephrine, plus  glucagon, is to respond to stress.  And this is getting the body ready, then,  for fight or flight response.  </p>
<p>So, the next time we come in here and  we're going to actually talk about how we  we we are using the hypothalamus  pituitary axis to regulate reproduction.  See you then.  Bye-bye.</p>
