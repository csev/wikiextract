<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Here is a concise list of the course materials and activities. Each is described in more detail below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Lectures: these present the course materials and software</li>
<li>Discussion Forum: for getting and giving help, discussing the course, etc.</li>
<li>Homework Assignments: Exploring and learning the software programs and tools presented in the class. No grade is given.</li>
<li>Optional Assignment: Create a one-minute sound piece using Soundation and posting it to the SoundCloud website.</li>
<li>Exams: There will be two exams, each worth 50% of your course grade.</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Video_Lectures">Video Lectures</span></h2>
<p>The videos are divided into sections. While each section has a fair number of videos, the videos are generally short so the total amount of time for the videos in a section is 2-4 hours. A few videos will be labeled optional.
Discussion Forum
Please use the discussion forum as a great resource. Helpfully respond to posts. Be sure to post in the most appropriate forum for your question or comment. Vote up important questions so that they come to the attention of the course staff.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Homework_Assignments">Homework Assignments</span></h2>
<p>Homework assignments in this course will not be graded and should involve exploring and learning the software programs and tools introduced. Spending time with each software program is essential to fully understand and utilize the theories and concepts introduced in the course. </p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Optional_Assignment">Optional Assignment</span></h2>
<p>During week three, use the Soundation Online Music Studio (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://soundation.com">http://soundation.com</a>) to create a one-minute sound piece and post it on the SoundCloud sound sharing website (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://soundcloud.com/pages/contact">https://soundcloud.com/pages/contact</a>). After you have registered, upload your completed one-minute Soundation audio file to SoundCloud. Please read the SoundCloud Community Guidelines (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://soundcloud.com/community-guidelines">https://soundcloud.com/community-guidelines</a>). Please listen to as many pieces as you can and vote for your favorites by the end of week four. It should be fun to hear the selections that had the highest number of votes. No grade will be given for this assignment.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exams">Exams</span></h2>
<p>Cheating Policy: Exams should be completed in the limited time allotted without consulting with other people. You may consult any of the course materials or any materials referred to in the course. You should not otherwise search the web while taking the exam.</p>
<p>We will have two exams, one near the middle of the course and one at the end. You will take them in your web browser, submitting multiple choice and short-answer style responses. The second exam will primarily test the material that comes after the first exam. So in that sense it tests the second half of the course, not the entire course.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="List_your_music">List your music</span></h2>
<p>On the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Digitalsounddesign:ListYourMusicPage" title="Digitalsounddesign:ListYourMusicPage"> List Your Music Page</a>  you can link to your music if you like to do so. Please limit yourself to one line per entry so we can keep an overview.</p>
