<p><b>Defining Globalization</b>
<br /><br />
Money, the world of money, represents globalization at its most intense.
<br /><br />
Emerging forms of global law-making, often organized through trade agreements, are governing a lot of economic ties such as the ties of money and the ties of trade.
<br /><br />
How do we actually respond to globalization, all of its economic, political, social, and ecological connections, but also how do we make sense of how our response is itself structured by global market imperatives?
<br /><br />
The 3 "R"s of Response to Globalization
<br />- Reaction
<br />- Resistance
<br />- Resilience 
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>Globalization is Two Things</b>
<br /><br />
Globalization is the extension, intensification, and acceleration of consequential worldwide interconnections.
<br /><br />AND<br /><br />
Globalization is a big buzzword of political speech that's used by business leaders, by political leaders, by protestors, in different ways, but nevertheless used as a buzzword to make politically charged arguments about how the world is shaping up and where it should be headed.
<br /><br /><br />
Examples of Interdependencies (Global Ties):
<br />- Global Trade Ties
<br />- Global Ties of Workers and Consumers
<br />- Ties of Global Finance and Money Flows
<br />- Ties of Global Law-Making through Trade Agreements and Human Rights Law-Making
<br />- Ties of Governments to One Another
<br />- Ties that Markets Have More and More of Around and Through Government Action
<br />- Ties Markets Have On Our Governance of our Personal Relation
<br />- Ties Between Territories
<br />- Ties that Change the Meaning of Territory
<br />- Ties of Global Health
<br /><br />
Introducing this doubled up definition of globalization not only allows us to look at how "big G" discourses of globalization have shaped the world, but it also allows us to look at how the world and global dynamics, global interdependencies shape discourses about globalization.
<br /><br />
In order to really understand globalization, we need to cross many intellectual boundaries. We have to carefully consider and connect what economics, political science, geography, history, and literature tell us about globalization. 
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>How does Globalization Affect Us?</b>
<br /><br />
How does Globalization and globalization affect me? How do global market relations mediate my personal experience of globalization?
<br /><br />
Those market relations shape the global interdependency. They are the key connective tissue of global interdependency. But market relations also work on us as individuals in ways that predispose us to think of Globalization in a certain kind of way.
<br /><br /><br />
<b>Market Governmentality</b>
<br /><br />
As people become more and more affected by market relations they become enlisted as calculating subjects, enterprising subjects, accountable subjects, risk managing subjects, entrepreneurial subjects.
<br /><br />
In Michel Foucault's terms, this process of enlistment is a form of what he called Neoliberal responsibilization.
<br /><br />
ABC's of Market Relations and how it affects us personally:
<br />A - Advertising
<br />B - Business
<br />C - Consumerism/Credit
<br />D - Debt (Discipline/Despair)
<br />E - Education for Entrepreneurialism </p>
