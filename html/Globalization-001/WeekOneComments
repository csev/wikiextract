<p>To All,<br />
I posted the following in the introductions section but I found this space and thought it might be more appropriate for my comment. If I have misinterpreted our professor's remarks or intent, please let me know. Absent that, here is a comment I felt compelled to make to clarify a few things:
I was surprised, shocked even, to hear Barack Obama even in the same sentence with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, let alone coupled with them as neo-liberals. Reagan and Thatcher can certainly be described as neo-liberals in the worst sense, but Obama is anything but a neo-liberal. He did everything he could in the face of the US's most disruptive, non-cooperatve Congress to address the economic disaster set in place by Reagan/Cheney and fully realized by the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld era. Reagan dismantled nearly all responsible government regulation in the US, not just in the banking industry. Obama would love to put responsible regulation back and has tried, but he has a congress that refuses to do essentially anything. He tried and partially succeeded in using the power of the US government to manage the financial crisis that others had created and would have done considerably more had he not been battling the most extreme do-nothing obstructive congress the US has ever seen (this is not an exaggeration--there is data to support this assertion--See the Rachel Maddow show for precise data) . This is probably not the place for a discussion of the damage caused by the Reagan/Thatcher era, but Obama is not part of their proven foolishness. He is not a proponent of the exposed "trickle down" theories that damaged both the US and England, not to mention the rest of the world. He is not inclined to support rapacious individuals or corporations. In addition to an immovable congress, the Obama administration and the US are also dealing with a truly conservative Supreme court that has recently revealed a willingness to tolerate racism in voting as well as the imposition of some religious rights over the medical rights of others, something that to many of us is clearly unconstitutional and is the epitome of the unravelling of the separation of church and state clearly established in the US  constitution. Obama is not responsible for these travesties either.
