<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>When reflecting on this course I realized that the lectures often went too fast. I had to pause the video in order to write down the words which were displayed, and I often wanted more detailed information. I decided that I needed a list of terms and their definitions (the glossary is fine for this) together with links to appropriate Wikipedia articles. That is what I have set out to do here. I have another motivation: I had never heard of Markdown language until I saw it at the top of the edit page, and I like the idea of learning it while I work on this page.</p>
<p>For the most part I will be following the course notes supplied with the course; it would be useful if clickable links were inserted into these notes.</p>
<p>All diagrams and photos which I use will be from Wikimedia Commons, so there should be no trouble with copyright.</p>

<p>There are five openings in the skulls of dinosaurs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Nares: openings for the nostrils.</p></li>
<li><p>Orbits: openings for the eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>Fenestrae: additional openings in the skull.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laterotemporal fenestrae are openings on the lateral sides of the skull, behind each orbit.</li>
<li>supratemporal fenestrae are openings on the top of the skull. Both the lateraltemporal and supratemporal fenestrae provide extra room for jaw muscles.</li>
<li>antorbital fenestrae are openings in the skull between the nares and the orbits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Axial_Skeleton">Axial Skeleton</span></h3>
<p>The vertebrae in different regions of the vertebral column have different shapes: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae">Cervical vertebrae</a> (neck) are addapted to support the weight of the head. They have large openings for blood and nerves.</p></li>
<li><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_vertebrae">Dorsal vertebrae</a> (back) often have tall spinous processes (where muscles and ligaments are attached) and facets on the sides of the centrum for articulation with the ribs.</p></li>
<li><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacral_vertebrae">Sacral vertebrae</a> (hips) are often fused to form a sacrum and are also fused to the pelvic bones where the leg muscles are attached.</p></li>
<li><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal_vertebrae">Caudal vertebrae</a> (tail) often have bones on the under side called <em>chevrons</em> which protect nerves and blood vessels and provide support for tail muscles.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Appendicular_Skeleton">Appendicular Skeleton</span></h3>
<p>All four limbed animals are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapod">tetrapods</a> (meaning "four-footed"). Arms and legs are attached to the rest of the body by <em>limb girdles</em>. Forearms connect to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_girdle">pectoral girdle</a> or shoulder girdle, the largest bone of which is the <em>scapula</em>. The hindlimbs connect to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis">pelvic girdle</a> consists of three bones: the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)">ilium</a> which is uppermost and is fused to the sacral vertibrae. Below the ilium are the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)">pubis</a> (which is nearer the belly) and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischium">ischium</a> (which is nearer the tail). The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum">acetabulum</a> is the hole in the pelvic girdle where the hind legs articulate.</p>
<p>Starting at the shoulder, the bones of the arm and hand are the <em>humorus</em>, the <em>radius</em> and <em>ulna</em> (the radius is the thinner of the two), the carpals (wrist bones), the <em>metacarpals</em>, and the <em>phalanges</em> (fingers). The corresponding bones in the leg and foot are the <em>femur</em>, the <em>fibula</em> and <em>tibula</em> (the fibula is the shin and is the thinner of the two), the <em>tarsals</em>, the <em>metatarsals</em>, and the <em>phalanges</em> (the same word as for the fingers).</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dinosaur_Groups">Dinosaur Groups</span></h3>
<p>Dinosaurs are divided into two groups on the basis of their pelvic structure.</p>
<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a href="/wiki/images/d/da/Dino_101_Saurischia_pelvis.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/d/da/Dino_101_Saurischia_pelvis.png/200px-Dino_101_Saurischia_pelvis.png" width="200" height="186" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/d/da/Dino_101_Saurischia_pelvis.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Saurischia pelvis structure (left side)</div></div></div></p>
<ol>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurischians">Saurischians</a>
(derived from the Greek <em>sauros</em> meaning "lizard" and <em>ischion</em> meaning "hip joint") have a pubis bone which is directed forward. This group includes all carnivorous dinosaurs, the bipedal theropods, and one of the two kinds of herbivorous dinosaurs, the sauropodomorphs.

<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropod">Theropod</a>
(meaning "beast feet")
were mainly carnivorous, had sharp teeth with serrated edges for cutting flesh and sharp claws. Some lacked teeth: modern birds are descended from the theropods.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropodomorph">Sauropodomorph</a>
(meaning "lizard-footed forms") were long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs. They include the quadrupedal sauropods which had long necks and tails, and relatively small heads. They had simple, peg-like teeth. Their vertebrae had air sacks. They were the largest animals to walk on Earth.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a href="/wiki/images/6/60/Dino_101_Ornithischia_pelvis.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/6/60/Dino_101_Ornithischia_pelvis.png/200px-Dino_101_Ornithischia_pelvis.png" width="200" height="179" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/6/60/Dino_101_Ornithischia_pelvis.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Ornithischia pelvis structure (left side)</div></div></div></p>
<ol>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischians">Ornithischians</a>
(derived from the Greek <em>ornitheios</em> meaning "of a bird" and <em>ischion</em> meaning "hip joint") have a pubis bone which is rear-pointing, possibly to leave more space for their digestive tract. They all had beaks and were probably herbivorous. 
There were five main groups:

<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopods">Ornithopod</a>
(derived from the Greek <em>ornithos</em> meaning "bird" and <em>pous</em> meaning "feet") did not have armour and moved bipedally, at least when running. They had horny beaks, an elongated pubis (sometimes extending past the ilium), and a no hole in the lower jaw. They include the 
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguanodon">iguanodons</a> which had large thumb spikes (possibly used for defence) and a long prehensile fifth fingers (used to forage for food). This group also includes the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrosaur">hadrosaurs</a>, the duck-billed dinosaurs. The back of the mouth contained a dental battery. They had a hinge between the upper jaw and the rest of its skull; while chewing, the upper jaw pushed outwards and sideways as the lower jaw slid against the upper teeth. Some had hollow crests which may have produced a distinct sound. Others had solid crests or none at all.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurs">Pachycephalosaurs</a> 
(meaning "thick-headed lizards") were bipedal, herbivorous/omnivorous, and had thick skulls (which may have been used in ramming predators or head-butting) which had nodes or spikes. Behind the beak they had sharp, conical teeth (suggesting omnivory) and leaf-shaped teeth at the rear of the mouth.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopsians">Ceratopsians</a>
(meaning "horned faces") were  quadrupeds with short tails and parrot-like beaks. Some had elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck which might have protected the neck from predators, been used for display or thermoregulation, or served as an attachment for the large neck and chewing muscles. Many had dental batteries.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurs">Stegosaurs</a>
(meaning "roof lizard" or "covered lizard") were quadrupeds with small, long, narrow heads. They have rows of bones (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoderm">osteoderms</a>) which develop into plates and spines along the back and tail. Their forelimbs are shorter than their hindlimbs; the fingers of the front feet were arranged into vertical columns, with the main fingers forming a tube-like structure.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosaurs">Ankylosaurs</a>
(meaning "fused lizard") were bulky quadrupeds, with short, powerful limbs. They were slow moving, largely because of the extreme weight of their armored skin.
They had a very small brain in proportion to their body.
Their small, triangular teeth were loosely packed (similar to stegosaurs).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Integument_and_Colour">Integument and Colour</span></h3>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integument">integument</a> is the natural covering of an animal or organ. Scales are made of <em>keratin</em> and are sometimes fossilized as are feathers. Recently fossilized <em>eumelanosomes</em> (pigment cells) have been studied and suggest that <em>Microraptor</em> was a glossy black or dark blue and <em>Anchiornis</em> was black and white with some redish-brown on its head.</p>
