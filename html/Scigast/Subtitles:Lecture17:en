00:00:03,900 --&gt; 00:00:09,730
Okay, let's talk about the second form of 
heat transfer, convection. 

2
00:00:09,730 --&gt; 00:00:15,240
Now in convection heat usually is being 
transferred involving some sort of like 

3
00:00:15,240 --&gt; 00:00:20,580
bulk movement of the material. 
So in that case we have some substance 

4
00:00:20,580 --&gt; 00:00:25,010
which is originally at high temperature, 
and they are going to move from one place 

5
00:00:25,010 --&gt; 00:00:28,090
to another place. 
And at the same time this happens, heat 

6
00:00:28,090 --&gt; 00:00:32,660
energy is being carried with them and be 
transferred when it's in direct contact 

7
00:00:32,660 --&gt; 00:00:35,750
with another substance which is at low 
temperature. 

8
00:00:35,750 --&gt; 00:00:42,350
Now usually when convection takes place, 
it occurs in liquid or gases. 

9
00:00:42,350 --&gt; 00:00:48,260
Usually these are fluid like material. 
And inevitably we notice that when 

10
00:00:48,260 --&gt; 00:00:51,760
convection is taking place conduction is 
required. 

11
00:00:51,760 --&gt; 00:00:56,960
Because it takes direct contact between 
one hot substance and the cooler 

12
00:00:56,960 --&gt; 00:00:59,950
substance to be in contact so that energy 
can be transferred. 

13
00:00:59,950 --&gt; 00:01:03,990
It is very easy to understand that 
everybody at home they may have a heater 

14
00:01:03,990 --&gt; 00:01:09,140
which is using this convectional scheme. 
We would have this heater which is 

15
00:01:09,140 --&gt; 00:01:12,850
heating up. 
What happen is that you would have air 

16
00:01:12,850 --&gt; 00:01:16,910
being heat up by this heater. 
So when they're heating up what you have 

17
00:01:16,910 --&gt; 00:01:21,060
is that the air become having lower 
density. 

18
00:01:21,060 --&gt; 00:01:24,690
Having lower density they start to rise 
and move to the top. 

19
00:01:24,690 --&gt; 00:01:27,240
At the same time it creates some sort of 
like a vacuum. 

20
00:01:27,240 --&gt; 00:01:32,520
So that the cooler air will start to fill 
in and be heat up by the heater again. 

21
00:01:32,520 --&gt; 00:01:36,540
And the hot air when it goes up gradually 
become cooler. 

22
00:01:36,540 --&gt; 00:01:41,700
They sink back so as a way what we have 
is that we have this convection current 

23
00:01:41,700 --&gt; 00:01:46,740
going on and allowing this bulk of 
movement of fluid like substance 

24
00:01:46,740 --&gt; 00:01:49,595
involving the transfer of the heat from 
one place to another. 

25
00:01:49,595 --&gt; 00:01:55,770
Now in order to show you how this takes 
place, I'm going to invite my assistants 

26
00:01:55,770 --&gt; 00:02:00,686
to do an experiment for you. 
Leo and Angel. 

27
00:02:00,686 --&gt; 00:02:06,100
Now in this particular experiment what do we 
have is that we will have some hot water, 

28
00:02:06,100 --&gt; 00:02:11,870
which is highlighted in yellow with dye 
and we have cold water which is 

29
00:02:11,870 --&gt; 00:02:15,200
highlighted in blue. 
Now what we're going to do is we're going 

30
00:02:15,200 --&gt; 00:02:18,660
to put this hot water and cold water 
together. 

31
00:02:18,660 --&gt; 00:02:21,770
But each time we are doing it in a 
slightly different way. 

32
00:02:21,770 --&gt; 00:02:26,430
In one case we put the hot water on top 
and in the other case we put the cold 

33
00:02:26,430 --&gt; 00:02:28,418
water on top. 
Let's see what happens. 

34
00:02:28,418 --&gt; 00:02:35,220
Angel and Leo. 
Now you see, they use a card to help to 

35
00:02:35,220 --&gt; 00:02:39,266
hold the solution. 
And now they are putting on your 

36
00:02:39,266 --&gt; 00:02:45,830
right-hand side, we have the hot water on 
top and the cold water at the bottom. 

37
00:02:45,830 --&gt; 00:02:50,390
And on the left hand side we have the 
cold water on top and the hot water at 

38
00:02:50,390 --&gt; 00:02:53,440
the bottom. 
Let's pay attention on the right hand 

39
00:02:53,440 --&gt; 00:02:56,790
side. 
Do you notice that the yellow solution in 

40
00:02:56,790 --&gt; 00:03:01,800
fact they remain yellow all the time? 
And the blue solution remain blue all 

41
00:03:01,800 --&gt; 00:03:04,440
the time. 
Basically that's no movement whatsoever, 

42
00:03:04,440 --&gt; 00:03:08,780
why? 
Because the yellow water, they are of 

43
00:03:08,780 --&gt; 00:03:13,540
lighter density, they stay on top. 
And the blue one, colder, they remain 

44
00:03:13,540 --&gt; 00:03:15,800
having higher density, they stay at the 
bottom. 

45
00:03:15,800 --&gt; 00:03:19,180
And that's no bulk movement of the 
solution. 

46
00:03:19,180 --&gt; 00:03:23,698
On the other hand if you look at the left 
hand side, what you see is hot water 

47
00:03:23,698 --&gt; 00:03:27,750
originally from the bottom it is having 
lower density. 

48
00:03:27,750 --&gt; 00:03:31,510
It's start to move up. 
The cold water blue on top it having 

49
00:03:31,510 --&gt; 00:03:33,850
higher density. 
It sinks back. 

50
00:03:33,850 --&gt; 00:03:40,414
So you may recognize in a minute or two they get all mixed up. 
It becomes a green solution. 

51
00:03:40,414 --&gt; 00:03:44,360
Homogeneous. 
So that tells you how convection takes 

52
00:03:44,360 --&gt; 00:03:49,610
place involving bulk movement. 
In fact this kind of convection process, 

53
00:03:49,610 --&gt; 00:03:53,930
we utilize this principle in a lot of 
other cooking location. 

54
00:03:53,930 --&gt; 00:04:00,560
For example when we are baking we again 
utilize the density difference of air. 

55
00:04:00,560 --&gt; 00:04:04,040
For example, in oven you can put some 
sort of food in the middle. 

56
00:04:04,040 --&gt; 00:04:07,980
Now what happens is that you have a 
heater which is heating up at the bottom. 

57
00:04:07,980 --&gt; 00:04:11,710
So what happens when it heats up the air 
become heated up, they will have a lower 

58
00:04:11,710 --&gt; 00:04:14,200
density. 
They will start to move up and they will 

59
00:04:14,200 --&gt; 00:04:18,970
be in contact with the steak and then the 
heat energy is transferred from the air 

60
00:04:18,970 --&gt; 00:04:23,230
to the steak. 
And when they go to the top eventually 

61
00:04:23,230 --&gt; 00:04:25,560
they become cooled down and they come 
back. 

62
00:04:25,560 --&gt; 00:04:30,970
So eventually in the oven what we have is 
that we'll have collision of the air 

63
00:04:30,970 --&gt; 00:04:36,300
molecules with the steak with the 
collision of the air molecule with the oven 

64
00:04:36,300 --&gt; 00:04:41,300
surface which is heated up. 
So therefore heat is being transferred 

65
00:04:41,300 --&gt; 00:04:44,770
from the heated surface, the metal, to 
the air. 

66
00:04:44,770 --&gt; 00:04:49,380
And again from the air to the steak by 
direct contact conduction. 

67
00:04:49,380 --&gt; 00:04:55,500
And this movement of air results in the 
convectional current and it helps us to 

68
00:04:55,500 --&gt; 00:05:00,950
heat up food in oven. 
But of course in oven we would have other 

69
00:05:00,950 --&gt; 00:05:06,092
heat transfer events going on including 
radiation, which we'll talk about a 

70
00:05:06,092 --&gt; 00:05:11,040
little bit later. 
Now similarly we say that these two 

71
00:05:11,040 --&gt; 00:05:16,355
combine together in fact allows us to 
cook a steak inside a oven. 

72
00:05:16,355 --&gt; 00:05:21,300
Now how about in another situation such 
as in boiling. 

73
00:05:21,300 --&gt; 00:05:25,620
Boiling is very easy to observe. 
When you have water we say that you put a 

74
00:05:25,620 --&gt; 00:05:30,290
pot of water on a heated surface. 
The heated surface will transfer the 

75
00:05:30,290 --&gt; 00:05:34,129
energy by conduction onto the body of 
water. 

76
00:05:34,129 --&gt; 00:05:37,170
And on the surface when they are in 
contact. 

77
00:05:37,170 --&gt; 00:05:42,020
The energy get picked up they become 
hotter lower density and they start to 

78
00:05:42,020 --&gt; 00:05:46,240
move up. 
And on the surface of the water body when 

79
00:05:46,240 --&gt; 00:05:51,005
the density is higher, they start to sink 
back resulting in this bulk 

80
00:05:51,005 --&gt; 00:05:56,075
convectional movement of this body. 
And so what you have is that by this 

81
00:05:56,075 --&gt; 00:05:59,680
convectional current you're going to 
generate a some sort of like a heat 

82
00:05:59,680 --&gt; 00:06:03,855
transfer and eventually the entire body 
of the water become heated up. 

83
00:06:03,855 --&gt; 00:06:08,640
Now, of course, the advantage of that is 
you can maintain a very stable 

84
00:06:08,640 --&gt; 00:06:13,760
temperature by this active movement. 
Now, in fact, when we talk about boiling, 

85
00:06:13,760 --&gt; 00:06:17,790
you need to understand that boiling in 
fact is defined by the condition that we 

86
00:06:17,790 --&gt; 00:06:23,340
would have a particular liquid. 
When they go to a particular temperature 

87
00:06:23,340 --&gt; 00:06:26,990
that the vapor pressure equals to 
atmospheric pressure. 

88
00:06:26,990 --&gt; 00:06:30,759
Then that's the time that we call the 
boiling point and that's the boiling 

89
00:06:30,759 --&gt; 00:06:34,220
occur. 
In fact, if it increases the pressure, 

90
00:06:34,220 --&gt; 00:06:38,620
what it means is that you need to have 
more energy introduced in order to allow 

91
00:06:38,620 --&gt; 00:06:44,316
this water to go through the vapor state. 
And so therefore what we notice is that 

92
00:06:44,316 --&gt; 00:06:51,034
if you have one atmospheric pressure, 
what we have as the boiling point is 100 

93
00:06:51,034 --&gt; 00:06:54,500
degree. 
But, if you have higher atmospheric 

94
00:06:54,500 --&gt; 00:06:58,740
pressure that means it takes more energy 
to raise the body of water to that 

95
00:06:58,740 --&gt; 00:07:01,920
particular condition that they can 
generate vapor. 

96
00:07:01,920 --&gt; 00:07:07,088
And you'll find that the boiling 
temperature can go up as high as 160-180 

97
00:07:07,088 --&gt; 00:07:09,539
degree when this ten atmospheric 
pressure. 

98
00:07:09,539 --&gt; 00:07:15,170
And of course the same thing happens if we 
have even higher pressure applied to this 

99
00:07:15,170 --&gt; 00:07:19,948
liquid body. 
We can utilize it as a way to help us to 

100
00:07:19,948 --&gt; 00:07:23,159
cook things more effectively. 
You remember that many people would have 

101
00:07:23,159 --&gt; 00:07:27,350
a pressure cooker at home. 
What they allow you to do is that would 

102
00:07:27,350 --&gt; 00:07:30,180
raise the temperature inside this particular 
cooker. 

103
00:07:30,180 --&gt; 00:07:35,050
And when you boil it because the pressure 
keeps on being built up so therefore you 

104
00:07:35,050 --&gt; 00:07:37,160
need to have higher temperature to keep 
it boiling. 

105
00:07:37,160 --&gt; 00:07:41,000
So therefore you can raise the 
temperature above 100 degree so that 

106
00:07:41,000 --&gt; 00:07:44,390
allows more effective cooking of the 
food. 

107
00:07:44,390 --&gt; 00:07:51,190
Boiling in fact can also be affected by 
other elements such in this case is salt. 

108
00:07:51,190 --&gt; 00:07:55,410
We say that when you're boiling something 
the temperature at the boiling point actually 

109
00:07:55,410 --&gt; 00:07:59,120
is 100 degree. 
In fact you can manipulate it by adding 

110
00:07:59,120 --&gt; 00:08:02,670
more sugar or salt. 
Because when you put salt and sugar there 

111
00:08:02,670 --&gt; 00:08:06,430
when salt and sugar reach the point of 
100 degree. 

112
00:08:06,430 --&gt; 00:08:09,050
Do you think salt and sugar they would 
become vapor? 

113
00:08:09,050 --&gt; 00:08:11,970
No they won't. 
They keep on absorbing more heat and yet 

114
00:08:11,970 --&gt; 00:08:16,270
they are not being vaporized. 
So what happens is that it results in keep 

115
00:08:16,270 --&gt; 00:08:21,820
on elevating the temperature and as a 
result when you have salt and sugar added to 

116
00:08:21,820 --&gt; 00:08:24,270
a solution the boiling point usually go 
up. 

117
00:08:24,270 --&gt; 00:08:27,370
A few degrees, sometimes 101, sometimes 
102. 

118
00:08:27,370 --&gt; 00:08:31,380
And we are going to demonstrate that to 
you in a separate experiment that you'll 

119
00:08:31,380 --&gt; 00:08:34,480
see later. 
Now, of course at the same time we can 

120
00:08:34,480 --&gt; 00:08:38,030
also do deep frying. 
In this case when we are doing deep 

121
00:08:38,030 --&gt; 00:08:42,050
frying we are relying on another medium, 
in this case oil. 

122
00:08:42,050 --&gt; 00:08:45,850
We use the oil as a medium with a hot 
surface. 

123
00:08:45,850 --&gt; 00:08:49,910
When the hot surface in contact with the 
oil, the oil becomes heated up. 

124
00:08:49,910 --&gt; 00:08:52,440
And when they heat up, they have lower 
density. 

125
00:08:52,440 --&gt; 00:08:55,110
They start moving up. 
So now let's say you have some sort of 

126
00:08:55,110 --&gt; 00:08:57,950
meat in the middle. 
The meat will be constantly in contact 

127
00:08:57,950 --&gt; 00:09:01,102
with all this heated-up oil, which is 
moving upward. 

128
00:09:01,102 --&gt; 00:09:06,780
And then by direct contact conduction. 
Heat will be transferred to the meat. 

129
00:09:06,780 --&gt; 00:09:12,495
And of course, when they rise to the top 
the oil which is at lower temperature or 

130
00:09:12,495 --&gt; 00:09:17,060
higher density, they sink back. 
So again it creates a convectional 

131
00:09:17,060 --&gt; 00:09:21,476
current that allows us to heat up the 
meat by deep frying. 

132
00:09:21,476 --&gt; 00:09:25,790
Now all this, of course, it would have 
advantage because it allows you to 

133
00:09:25,790 --&gt; 00:09:29,820
generate very high temperature. 
Not in water 100 degree. 

134
00:09:29,820 --&gt; 00:09:34,850
Oil can go up to a 100, 200 degrees. 
Now so what happens is that at that time 

135
00:09:34,850 --&gt; 00:09:40,060
such a high temperature sometimes it 
results in dehydrating because water at 

136
00:09:40,060 --&gt; 00:09:45,584
that point they would all go into vapor. 
Because it's higher then 100 degrees. 

137
00:09:45,584 --&gt; 00:09:50,180
Now so that's what we do in deep frying. 
You basically put all the food which is 

138
00:09:50,180 --&gt; 00:09:56,619
made of water and dip it into the oil. 
On that I want to illustrate again, when 

139
00:09:56,619 --&gt; 00:10:01,530
we are boiling something in fact this 
convention current is heavily affected by 

140
00:10:01,530 --&gt; 00:10:06,370
what kind of medium they are in. 
Sometimes the viscosity of a medium can 

141
00:10:06,370 --&gt; 00:10:08,922
affect how the convention current can 
take place. 

142
00:10:08,922 --&gt; 00:10:14,100
For example, if you are making some kind 
of soup, which is very thick such as 

143
00:10:14,100 --&gt; 00:10:19,650
creamy soup or a porridge or so. 
They are very thick, convection will not 

144
00:10:19,650 --&gt; 00:10:25,570
be able to take place very easily because 
that requires bulk movement of the medium. 

145
00:10:25,570 --&gt; 00:10:29,770
On the other hand if it's in water, this 
bulk movement is much easier. 

146
00:10:29,770 --&gt; 00:10:34,150
So in the following section we're going 
to show you in another experiment that 

147
00:10:34,150 --&gt; 00:10:38,080
how the viscosity is going to change 
convectional current. 

148
00:10:38,080 --&gt; 00:10:43,060
And I hope that you see how it exactly 
occurs and what makes a difference when 

149
00:10:43,060 --&gt; 00:10:46,581
you're cooking some sort of food with 
different viscosity.
