00:00:03,020 --&gt; 00:00:06,420
In this experiment we'll try to 
demonstrate to you what is heat 

2
00:00:06,420 --&gt; 00:00:09,370
conductance. 
The experiment is very simple. 

3
00:00:09,370 --&gt; 00:00:15,070
What we do is that we put ice, the same 
amount of ice in subzero degree into 

4
00:00:15,070 --&gt; 00:00:19,420
three plastic bags. 
After we have them put in, we try to lay 

5
00:00:19,420 --&gt; 00:00:24,370
them onto three different surfaces. 
On my left here's the plastic. 

6
00:00:24,370 --&gt; 00:00:29,790
In the middle, this is aluminum foil and 
on my right here is the wood. 

7
00:00:29,790 --&gt; 00:00:33,280
So we'll look at actually how different 
surfaces, they will be able to conduct 

8
00:00:33,280 --&gt; 00:00:39,410
the heat into this body of ice. 
So when heat is conducted into this body 

9
00:00:39,410 --&gt; 00:00:42,150
of ice they will be converted into 
liquid. 

10
00:00:42,150 --&gt; 00:00:45,700
That means they melt. 
So we'll see what happens and wait for a 

11
00:00:45,700 --&gt; 00:00:48,925
while and see on which surface they will 
melt faster. 

12
00:00:48,925 --&gt; 00:00:58,550
Well, it's been more than 15 minutes 
let's look at what happened. 

13
00:00:58,550 --&gt; 00:01:02,720
This is the one on the wood surface. 
How about this one? 

14
00:01:03,750 --&gt; 00:01:06,020
Look at that. 
It's all water. 

15
00:01:06,020 --&gt; 00:01:10,620
In this one we still see chunks of ice. 
And how about this one? 

16
00:01:10,620 --&gt; 00:01:14,198
Well, there's still a lot of ice in it. 
So you see what happened? 

17
00:01:14,198 --&gt; 00:01:19,400
The one on aluminum foil, because of the 
high conductance of aluminum foil, most 

18
00:01:19,400 --&gt; 00:01:23,390
of the ice they melt. 
And this one how about. 

19
00:01:23,390 --&gt; 00:01:26,570
Well there's still chunks of ice 
remaining so that means the wooden 

20
00:01:26,570 --&gt; 00:01:29,490
surface is not conducting the heat very 
effectively. 

21
00:01:29,490 --&gt; 00:01:33,480
The same thing happened here for the one 
on the plastic surface they are still 

22
00:01:33,480 --&gt; 00:01:36,947
chunks of ice. 
So that means the conductance is 

23
00:01:36,947 --&gt; 00:01:41,340
relatively lower. 
So that demonstrates to us that aluminum foil 

24
00:01:41,340 --&gt; 00:01:42,490
conducts very well.
