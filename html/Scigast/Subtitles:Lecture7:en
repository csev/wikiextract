[MUSIC]. 
Welcome to this class of The Science of 

2
00:00:37,028 --&gt; 00:00:40,535
Gastronomy. 
I'm King Chow from HKUST. 

3
00:00:40,535 --&gt; 00:00:43,525
So when you enroll in this particular 
couse you must be expecting that we're 

4
00:00:43,525 --&gt; 00:00:47,060
going to teach you how to cook delicious 
dishes. 

5
00:00:47,060 --&gt; 00:00:50,510
But let me remind you this course's focus 
is on the science. 

6
00:00:50,510 --&gt; 00:00:54,740
So, hopefully in this course we're going 
to introduce to you all the nitty-gritty 

7
00:00:54,740 --&gt; 00:00:59,170
about the science component, that how we 
practice it in the kitchen. 

8
00:00:59,170 --&gt; 00:01:06,562
Now lets look at why we start cooking. 
Now, if you look at the history when did 

9
00:01:06,562 --&gt; 00:01:10,249
we start cooking? 
We always say that it's roughly between 

10
00:01:10,249 --&gt; 00:01:14,419
like a 2 million years ago or 300,000 
years ago, that we start cooking. 

11
00:01:14,419 --&gt; 00:01:18,420
Why, because we have obtained 
archaeological evidence with all these 

12
00:01:18,420 --&gt; 00:01:23,330
artifacts illustrating that people at 
that time, in fact, we start using fire. 

13
00:01:23,330 --&gt; 00:01:26,230
And, we have cooking pots and all these 
things. 

14
00:01:26,230 --&gt; 00:01:29,790
So, that means roughly that time, we 
start cooking. 

15
00:01:29,790 --&gt; 00:01:34,120
But then we also need to ask ourselves, 
how are you different from a dog or a 

16
00:01:34,120 --&gt; 00:01:39,310
cat, horse or a cow? 
Horse and cows they eat vegetables, 

17
00:01:39,310 --&gt; 00:01:43,230
grasses, leaves. 
Dogs and cats they eat meat. 

18
00:01:43,230 --&gt; 00:01:45,720
So what are we? 
We are omnivores, we eat everything. 

19
00:01:45,720 --&gt; 00:01:51,338
So how's it different? 
How's it affecting our evolution. 

20
00:01:51,338 --&gt; 00:01:56,540
How cooking food by itself is helping us. 
Think about that. 

21
00:01:56,540 --&gt; 00:02:02,120
Do you know how much energy a dog would 
use for their normal function? 

22
00:02:02,120 --&gt; 00:02:06,725
Particularly for their brain. 
The reality is that they only spend about 

23
00:02:06,725 --&gt; 00:02:11,100
5% of their energy for their brain to 
maintain their function. 

24
00:02:11,100 --&gt; 00:02:15,301
But how about human being? 
We normally use about 20 to 25%, so 

25
00:02:15,301 --&gt; 00:02:20,050
basically if we want to think, we are 
using a lot of energy. 

26
00:02:20,050 --&gt; 00:02:25,620
So, the ability to be able to use food, 
cooked food specifically, it allows us to 

27
00:02:25,620 --&gt; 00:02:29,430
capture the energy, to allow us to digest 
very effectively. 

28
00:02:29,430 --&gt; 00:02:34,820
And utilize nutrients to support ourself, 
to support our development, that's very 

29
00:02:34,820 --&gt; 00:02:38,070
important. 
So, that's what happened and how it comes 

30
00:02:38,070 --&gt; 00:02:42,720
to human being. 
For human being that's what we are, we 

31
00:02:42,720 --&gt; 00:02:48,480
utilize our brain a lot. 
And being able to cook foods in fact give 

32
00:02:48,480 --&gt; 00:02:54,090
us the advantage to capture more energy 
to support the development of our brain. 

33
00:02:54,090 --&gt; 00:02:59,870
So you look at this particular diagram 
illustrating on the left-hand side is the 

34
00:02:59,870 --&gt; 00:03:04,080
apes, on the right hand-side that's the 
hominid or the human being. 

35
00:03:04,080 --&gt; 00:03:08,140
You may recognize that if you look at the 
chimpanzees, in fact the skull they have 

36
00:03:08,140 --&gt; 00:03:11,280
a very different shape. 
Look at the brain, the brain is 

37
00:03:11,280 --&gt; 00:03:15,670
relatively small. 
But then they have a really bulging 

38
00:03:15,670 --&gt; 00:03:20,350
jaws coming out, because they use it for 
eating and hunting. 

39
00:03:20,350 --&gt; 00:03:26,080
For human being we have a relatively flat 
face, but then our brain is relatively 

40
00:03:26,080 --&gt; 00:03:29,295
much larger in proportion. 
So, that's how we are. 

41
00:03:29,295 --&gt; 00:03:35,140
And, what happened is that in fact 
after all this apes they start to develop 

42
00:03:35,140 --&gt; 00:03:39,460
this ability to eat cooked food. 
That's another element that come into play 

43
00:03:39,460 --&gt; 00:03:43,020
and in fact our relative apes they are 
also developing too. 

44
00:03:43,020 --&gt; 00:03:47,890
For example in this case the chimpanzee. 
You may recognize that this chimpanze is like 

45
00:03:47,890 --&gt; 00:03:51,760
munching some of the soil after they eat 
some of the plants. 

46
00:03:51,760 --&gt; 00:03:57,980
Well what happened is that because the 
mixture of this soil together with plants 

47
00:03:57,980 --&gt; 00:04:01,921
results in the generation of some 
anti-malarial compound. 

48
00:04:01,921 --&gt; 00:04:06,950
So in fact it helps them to cure disease 
and infection. 

49
00:04:06,950 --&gt; 00:04:13,930
Now, so therefore, food or the ability to 
eat food in a very specific way is more 

50
00:04:13,930 --&gt; 00:04:18,880
than just for the nutrients. 
Sometimes it's for the health and 

51
00:04:18,880 --&gt; 00:04:22,000
later on we may find that becomes 
something like culture. 

52
00:04:23,940 --&gt; 00:04:27,960
Same thing happened to the bonobo. 
What they have is that they developed skills. 

53
00:04:27,960 --&gt; 00:04:30,210
They want to eat the termites so what do 
they do? 

54
00:04:30,210 --&gt; 00:04:34,860
They put their saliva on the stick so 
that they pop into the cave where the 

55
00:04:34,860 --&gt; 00:04:37,718
termites are there. 
And they will be able to pull out and 

56
00:04:37,718 --&gt; 00:04:40,302
take those termites out so that they 
can eat them. 

57
00:04:40,302 --&gt; 00:04:46,595
So, the ability to use this stick become a 
skill; again the skill becomes culture too. 

58
00:04:46,595 --&gt; 00:04:51,980
Not just about the apes. 
Think about elephant. 

59
00:04:51,980 --&gt; 00:04:57,730
Look at this African elephant. 
In fact, sometimes we notice that these

60
00:04:57,730 --&gt; 00:05:02,639
elephants, they would go into the cave. 
At the time of rainy seasons when all the 

61
00:05:02,639 --&gt; 00:05:05,440
plants that are running short of 
minerals. 

62
00:05:05,440 --&gt; 00:05:09,540
What they do is they go into the cave and 
they eat the salt directly because they 

63
00:05:09,540 --&gt; 00:05:13,860
want to recapture the mineral which is 
missing in their regular diet. 

64
00:05:13,860 --&gt; 00:05:19,590
Again, that becomes culture. 
Now having all this, we also recognize 

65
00:05:19,590 --&gt; 00:05:23,870
animals like the sea otter. 
They are eating abalone and clams. 

66
00:05:23,870 --&gt; 00:05:28,630
They develop this ability, they would be 
like floating on the water and putting 

67
00:05:28,630 --&gt; 00:05:32,560
all the food in front of them. 
Again, it is a very unique culture that 

68
00:05:32,560 --&gt; 00:05:36,460
they develop. 
So, therefore in this course we are going 

69
00:05:36,460 --&gt; 00:05:40,220
to cover all the science behind it. 
But we are also going to cover some 

70
00:05:40,220 --&gt; 00:05:44,024
aspects of the culture and techniques that 
we use for the cooking. 

71
00:05:44,024 --&gt; 00:05:48,048
And in order to know more about that we 
need to understand a little bit of the 

72
00:05:48,048 --&gt; 00:05:50,650
geographical location where the food is 
from. 

73
00:05:50,650 --&gt; 00:05:53,950
What kind of culture the people there 
have. 

74
00:05:53,950 --&gt; 00:05:57,700
And that help us to understand. 
So, collectively I think there are few 

75
00:05:57,700 --&gt; 00:06:02,222
important elements. 
We want to understand how the culinary

76
00:06:02,222 --&gt; 00:06:05,560
process are being done in different 
places. 

77
00:06:05,560 --&gt; 00:06:11,130
We want to know how to use certain 
method or technique, or tools, so that we 

78
00:06:11,130 --&gt; 00:06:16,360
can make good food and make improvement. 
And, of course, with all these, we would 

79
00:06:16,360 --&gt; 00:06:22,480
be able to invent our own new dishes. 
Now, most important of all is that we 

80
00:06:22,480 --&gt; 00:06:25,440
would now be able to learn about all the 
different culture. 

81
00:06:25,440 --&gt; 00:06:28,210
We can mix different kind of food. 
And we can use different kind of 

82
00:06:28,210 --&gt; 00:06:30,188
techniques, and combine them all 
together. 

83
00:06:30,188 --&gt; 00:06:34,330
And most important of all, we understand 
that cooking. 

84
00:06:34,330 --&gt; 00:06:40,000
The first rule of thumb is that we need 
to use fresh and good food, to start 

85
00:06:40,000 --&gt; 00:06:42,590
with. 
And of course we need to know how to cook 

86
00:06:42,590 --&gt; 00:06:46,150
them, so what kind of utensil? 
How to transfer the heat so you can get 

87
00:06:46,150 --&gt; 00:06:49,560
them cooked? 
And we need to have a basic understanding of 

88
00:06:49,560 --&gt; 00:06:52,780
the raw material, the food, the 
characteristic. 

89
00:06:52,780 --&gt; 00:06:55,810
How they conduct heat, how they get cooked very 
easily. 

90
00:06:57,190 --&gt; 00:07:00,440
And of course we want to control the 
texture of the food. 

91
00:07:00,440 --&gt; 00:07:03,840
The flavor, the taste, and how to mix them 
together. 

92
00:07:03,840 --&gt; 00:07:06,510
And of course, at the end we want to have 
good food. 

93
00:07:06,510 --&gt; 00:07:10,820
And there are psychological aspects of it 
that how do we get stimulated by good 

94
00:07:10,820 --&gt; 00:07:14,590
food, the good taste, the good smell. 
And whether we should have them 

95
00:07:14,590 --&gt; 00:07:17,175
constantly or we should have them once a 
while. 

96
00:07:17,175 --&gt; 00:07:23,770
And most important of all, again, is that 
we need to be very critical about what 

97
00:07:23,770 --&gt; 00:07:28,620
way the people are practising cooking. 
Sometimes, there's no expert in any 

98
00:07:28,620 --&gt; 00:07:30,760
single field. 
And we simply need to learn about the 

99
00:07:30,760 --&gt; 00:07:33,830
rationale behind it, and we can modify it 
accordingly. 

100
00:07:33,830 --&gt; 00:07:38,559
And as a science aspect, we need to focus 
on experimenting. 

101
00:07:38,559 --&gt; 00:07:42,470
So, I hope that you'll be able to 
experiment it at home in your kitchen. 

102
00:07:42,470 --&gt; 00:07:46,130
To learn about trying how to mix 
different kinds of food, with different 

103
00:07:46,130 --&gt; 00:07:50,570
kinds of cooking techniques together. 
And if you keep a good record that is 

104
00:07:50,570 --&gt; 00:07:54,170
like a laboratory log book. 
And you learn from the experience. 

105
00:07:54,170 --&gt; 00:07:57,460
I hope at the end you will have fun in 
this course. 

106
00:07:57,460 --&gt; 00:08:00,820
And at the end you will be able to cook a 
few good dishes for yourself and your 

107
00:08:00,820 --&gt; 00:08:05,570
family members or your loved one. 
Now in this course, I'm going to tell you 

108
00:08:05,570 --&gt; 00:08:11,240
a lot about these theory things. 
But we also going to demonstrate to you 

109
00:08:11,240 --&gt; 00:08:17,059
some of the scientific principles, with 
that I need to have my assistants, Leo 

110
00:08:17,059 --&gt; 00:08:22,180
and Angel. 
And they going to be with me, helping me to 

111
00:08:22,180 --&gt; 00:08:27,410
do some experiment in front of the video. 
So that you can understand better about 

112
00:08:27,410 --&gt; 00:08:30,410
how the science is being practiced in the 
kitchen.
