00:00:01,580 --&gt; 00:00:06,340
In this following demonstration, we're 
going to show you the concept about heat

2
00:00:06,340 --&gt; 00:00:10,750
capacity. 
Now we are going to do one experiment

3
00:00:10,750 --&gt; 00:00:14,180
using very simple material. 
Ice and water at home.

4
00:00:15,230 --&gt; 00:00:18,360
Here what we have is that we have a 
bucket of ice. 

5
00:00:18,360 --&gt; 00:00:22,810
And we put a few spoonfuls of ice in the 
plastic bag. 

6
00:00:22,810 --&gt; 00:00:25,290
Here, it is. 
Okay? 

7
00:00:25,290 --&gt; 00:00:29,690
Now so what we are going to do is we 
put this plastic bag into this two bowls, 

8
00:00:29,690 --&gt; 00:00:34,830
in one bowl we have water and the other 
bowl we don't have anything, so basically 

9
00:00:34,830 --&gt; 00:00:37,740
is just air. 
So what we want to demonstrate is that 

10
00:00:37,740 --&gt; 00:00:41,732
when the ice is put into this bowl 
depending on what the contact is. 

11
00:00:41,732 --&gt; 00:00:45,940
The surrounding medium, they would have different 
heat capacity. 

12
00:00:45,940 --&gt; 00:00:52,310
They carries some of the energy, they 
would be transferred to this pack of ice. 

13
00:00:52,310 --&gt; 00:00:55,900
And the ice after receiving energy they 
would be melted. 

14
00:00:55,900 --&gt; 00:00:59,890
So what happened is that we'll wait for a 
while and see actually how much of the 

15
00:00:59,890 --&gt; 00:01:04,770
ice has melted. 
And by then we will know how much heat is 

16
00:01:04,770 --&gt; 00:01:09,920
being released to them to help them to 
be converted from solid state into 

17
00:01:09,920 --&gt; 00:01:12,260
liquid. 
Okay lets start experiment. 

18
00:01:12,260 --&gt; 00:01:18,480
Angel. 
Now so we have one of the bag put on the 

19
00:01:18,480 --&gt; 00:01:23,300
left hand side which is just air. 
And one the bag is on the right hand side 

20
00:01:23,300 --&gt; 00:01:28,070
the same amount five spoonful of it. 
And then now we're putting some water in 

21
00:01:28,070 --&gt; 00:01:32,130
it which we will able to submerge the ice 
into it. 

22
00:01:32,130 --&gt; 00:01:39,680
Okay, now you can take a look at it and 
say well after we put the ice in it they will 

23
00:01:39,680 --&gt; 00:01:45,070
be in contact with the water. 
So what is mean that the water in contact 

24
00:01:45,070 --&gt; 00:01:48,090
with the ice. 
They would be able to conduct and 

25
00:01:48,090 --&gt; 00:01:52,280
transmit the energy from the water to the 
ice. 

26
00:01:52,280 --&gt; 00:01:57,330
It results in a phase transition so that 
the ice would now be converted into 

27
00:01:57,330 --&gt; 00:02:01,190
liquid. 
And so after waiting for a while we look 

28
00:02:01,190 --&gt; 00:02:05,160
at actually how much of the ice has been 
converted into liquid. 

29
00:02:05,160 --&gt; 00:02:09,948
And in fact, very quickly we start seeing 
some of the ice has melted. 

30
00:02:09,948 --&gt; 00:02:13,894
So okay, right. 
We'll wait for a while. 

31
00:02:13,894 --&gt; 00:02:17,450
Okay. 
After waiting for a few minutes you may 

32
00:02:17,450 --&gt; 00:02:20,590
notice that. 
The bag on the left which is in the bowl 

33
00:02:20,590 --&gt; 00:02:26,065
without any water, just air. 
That, they remain as ice. 

34
00:02:26,065 --&gt; 00:02:31,530
But how about the bag on the right where 
the ice is submerged in water. 

35
00:02:31,530 --&gt; 00:02:35,660
What we have is that most of the ice, 
they have already melted. 

36
00:02:35,660 --&gt; 00:02:40,760
So what it tells you is that water with 
the higher heat capacity in fact they 

37
00:02:40,760 --&gt; 00:02:44,460
contain a lot more energy and through 
this conduction, they would be able to 

38
00:02:44,460 --&gt; 00:02:49,690
transfer the energy to this ice. 
And allow it to be melted very easily and 

39
00:02:49,690 --&gt; 00:02:55,446
convert it and transform it into a phase,
which is now liquid and no longer solid. 

40
00:02:55,446 --&gt; 00:03:01,050
Well, air having a much lower heat 
capacity, it will not be able to transfer 

41
00:03:01,050 --&gt; 00:03:04,880
as much heat so that the ice remains here 
as ice.
