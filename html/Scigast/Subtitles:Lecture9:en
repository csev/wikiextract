00:00:04,450 --&gt; 00:00:08,430
Welcome back. 
Lets talk about Gastronomy the next 

2
00:00:08,430 --&gt; 00:00:11,700
section, about Cooking via the Heat 
Transfer. 

3
00:00:11,700 --&gt; 00:00:15,950
Now when we talk about heat transfer in 
cooking there are few processes actually 

4
00:00:15,950 --&gt; 00:00:19,440
we're going to do including the mixing of 
food. 

5
00:00:19,440 --&gt; 00:00:24,860
Including heating up something using your 
utensils so that we can heat up the food. 

6
00:00:24,860 --&gt; 00:00:28,140
We can talk about the chilling so that 
the food can be raised at a high 

7
00:00:28,140 --&gt; 00:00:32,220
temperature and we cool it down to a low 
temperature or we talk about freezing. 

8
00:00:32,220 --&gt; 00:00:34,780
Basically you want to have the food 
frozen. 

9
00:00:34,780 --&gt; 00:00:37,885
Now all these would involve the transfer 
of energy. 

10
00:00:37,885 --&gt; 00:00:40,802
And we are going to talk about one by 
one. 

11
00:00:40,802 --&gt; 00:00:47,610
Now, energy as we understand can exist in 
multiple form such as chemical energy. 

12
00:00:47,610 --&gt; 00:00:52,470
Chemical energy usually are energy 
which is store in the substance where 

13
00:00:52,470 --&gt; 00:00:55,760
they keep all this molecule and atoms 
bound together. 

14
00:00:55,760 --&gt; 00:01:00,380
That's called chemical energy. 
Electromagnetic energy these are the 

15
00:01:00,380 --&gt; 00:01:04,540
energy which can be transmitted in wave 
form so that it can go from one place to 

16
00:01:04,540 --&gt; 00:01:08,430
the other without any medium in between. 
And that's referred to as electromagenetic 

17
00:01:08,430 --&gt; 00:01:13,030
energy. 
Kinetic energy is very easy to understand 

18
00:01:13,030 --&gt; 00:01:17,810
when you move around you have motion you 
have vibration you migrate from one place 

19
00:01:17,810 --&gt; 00:01:21,290
to another place. 
That's referred to kinetic energy, 

20
00:01:21,290 --&gt; 00:01:25,650
movement is involved. 
Thermal energy is very easy to understand 

21
00:01:25,650 --&gt; 00:01:27,940
it's talking about the change in 
temperature. 

22
00:01:27,940 --&gt; 00:01:31,110
So from very low temperature to high 
temperature we say that there's an 

23
00:01:31,110 --&gt; 00:01:35,910
increase of thermal energy. 
And finally potential energy when we have 

24
00:01:35,910 --&gt; 00:01:40,100
any kind of such as a bottle. 
When we move it from one place to the 

25
00:01:40,100 --&gt; 00:01:45,350
other basically we would have energy 
stored in them in a potential form that 

26
00:01:45,350 --&gt; 00:01:48,680
can be used later on. 
That is called the potential energy. 

27
00:01:48,680 --&gt; 00:01:51,990
Now all this energy form they are inter 
convertible. 

28
00:01:51,990 --&gt; 00:01:55,162
Essential it's following the law of 
thermodynamics. 

29
00:01:55,162 --&gt; 00:01:58,485
Energy can be transferred from one form into 
another form. 

30
00:01:58,485 --&gt; 00:02:03,820
Now lets look at actually how heat energy 
is being transferred. 

31
00:02:03,820 --&gt; 00:02:09,200
When we say that heat when it is in the 
atomic scale we're talking about how this 

32
00:02:09,200 --&gt; 00:02:13,070
kinetic energy of a molecule or 
substance. 

33
00:02:13,070 --&gt; 00:02:18,790
When they are being transferred from one 
place to the other place through movement 

34
00:02:18,790 --&gt; 00:02:22,820
of molecules. 
Now so all this would involve the change 

35
00:02:22,820 --&gt; 00:02:27,190
of position. 
Change of orientation and change of their 

36
00:02:27,190 --&gt; 00:02:31,350
vibration frequency. 
And all this results in increase or 

37
00:02:31,350 --&gt; 00:02:36,900
decrease of their heat energy. 
Now in this whole process when some 

38
00:02:36,900 --&gt; 00:02:41,260
substance is changed from low kinetic 
energy to high kinetic energy we call 

39
00:02:41,260 --&gt; 00:02:45,120
that heat transfer. 
Now of course, what we're dealing with is 

40
00:02:45,120 --&gt; 00:02:49,060
including chilling, freezing, heating and 
all these things essentially we use in 

41
00:02:49,060 --&gt; 00:02:53,040
cooking. 
Now how about temperature. 

42
00:02:53,040 --&gt; 00:02:58,260
Temperature in a way is a very convenient 
way for us to measure what that kinetic 

43
00:02:58,260 --&gt; 00:03:03,150
energy is really is. 
We're refering to what the average speed 

44
00:03:03,150 --&gt; 00:03:07,820
a molecule of substance they are moving. 
Now so the higher the temperature that 

45
00:03:07,820 --&gt; 00:03:10,710
means they are more active the faster 
they are moving. 

46
00:03:10,710 --&gt; 00:03:14,930
The lower the temperature basically they 
are more stagnant. 

47
00:03:14,930 --&gt; 00:03:19,740
They are not moving around, and of course 
at the condition of absolute zero, that 

48
00:03:19,740 --&gt; 00:03:24,580
is in minus 273.15 Celsius degrees. 
What we have is that basically the 

49
00:03:24,580 --&gt; 00:03:30,600
molecules or the particles, they stay 
without any motion. 

50
00:03:30,600 --&gt; 00:03:32,950
And in that situation, we call it absolute 
zero. 

51
00:03:35,029 --&gt; 00:03:39,470
When we talk about heat and temperature, 
inevitably we need to talk about how heat 

52
00:03:39,470 --&gt; 00:03:43,710
flow from one place to another place. 
So I want to introduce to you a very 

53
00:03:43,710 --&gt; 00:03:46,310
simple equation. 
Not that I want you to remember it, but 

54
00:03:46,310 --&gt; 00:03:50,320
then it highlights some of the key 
elements of this so called heat and 

55
00:03:50,320 --&gt; 00:03:54,780
temperature and the flow of energy. 
Now basically the flow of energy can be 

56
00:03:54,780 --&gt; 00:04:01,880
highlighted in this, mark by Q. 
Q is amount of energy and t is the amount 

57
00:04:01,880 --&gt; 00:04:04,430
of time. 
So therefore the amount of energy 

58
00:04:04,430 --&gt; 00:04:08,390
transfer per unit time, that's 
referred to the rate of the heat transfer 

59
00:04:08,390 --&gt; 00:04:12,470
or heat flow. 
And this is affected by a few parameters 

60
00:04:12,470 --&gt; 00:04:18,660
including k mark here, referring to the 
very characteristic property of a 

61
00:04:18,660 --&gt; 00:04:21,360
substance this heat is transferring 
through. 

62
00:04:21,360 --&gt; 00:04:24,990
A refers to the area. 
That means how large a area this energy 

63
00:04:24,990 --&gt; 00:04:29,210
is being transferred through. 
Delta T refers to the temperature 

64
00:04:29,210 --&gt; 00:04:31,120
difference. 
Whether it's going from a very high 

65
00:04:31,120 --&gt; 00:04:34,880
temperature to a very low temperature, or 
they only differ by very little. 

66
00:04:34,880 --&gt; 00:04:38,740
So of course the higher the difference 
between the two temperature the faster 

67
00:04:38,740 --&gt; 00:04:43,180
the flow of the energy is. 
And of course finally L, L refers to 

68
00:04:43,180 --&gt; 00:04:48,250
the distance between this two sources. 
One is the energy source, the other one 

69
00:04:48,250 --&gt; 00:04:51,044
is the sink where the energy is going 
towards. 

70
00:04:51,044 --&gt; 00:04:56,610
Now having that I want to highlight that 
when we are cooking, we usually deal with 

71
00:04:56,610 --&gt; 00:04:58,762
a few ways that heat is being 
transferred. 

72
00:04:58,762 --&gt; 00:05:04,340
Usually they are done by conduction, 
convection, radiation, vaporization or 

73
00:05:04,340 --&gt; 00:05:07,220
condensation. 
And sometimes we refer to that case as a 

74
00:05:07,220 --&gt; 00:05:11,230
phase transition. 
All this would involve transfer of heat 

75
00:05:11,230 --&gt; 00:05:16,760
from one form to the other form. 
Now with that let's take a break and 

76
00:05:16,760 --&gt; 00:05:20,420
we'll look at each of them and see 
actually what's the principle behind them.
