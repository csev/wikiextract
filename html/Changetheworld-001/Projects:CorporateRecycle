<p>This is how this project topic got started via FB:
Sidney, great point however it's one I've struggled with for along time, thinking that quick and easy changes could make a big difference. Here's one example I saw in happen in London over 5 years ago. The building (not my company) decided to eliminate waste paper bins. Instead there would be recycling stations easily accessible throughout the floor (maybe a few feet away) for you to sort your garbage. At first I thought it would be fail but it was accepted and succeeded. There's so much waste we unconsciously throw away while we sit our desks and I'll guess 95% is recyclable. The question is why don't more building adopt this policy? In principle it seems like an easy enough strategy to implement. You may get some initial resistance but it's nothing that some upfront educational workshops and materials wouldn't help overcome. So how could we do this?</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Action_In_Progress">Action In Progress</span></h1>
<p>I've already been inspired to set up a meeting with the office manager of my former company and get their thoughts on why they would/wouldn't implement such a change. This topic allowed me to jog my memory on a simple idea made me realize there's no reason why I couldn't begin to take some action now, even it's just a conversation to see what's what. If others are interested maybe we all can conduct our own investigations and see what we come up with re: pros/cons.</p>
