<p>The Marcella Barnes Modern Homestead Community (MBMHC)is a project to provide a community commons through shared gardening, performance, gathering, and educational spaces. It is also going to be a model for sustainable community living, providing the community the majority of it's own food, energy, and medical supplies. The MBMHC will also provide free education on sustainable living, health, and a variety of other topics. </p>
<p>Additionally, the MBMHC will be home to foster children and a continuous care type retirement community that will share a building, which will enrich the lives of both populations. 
Everything will be designed to be sustainable, multi-purpose, and easy to use and maintain. The designs will vary from high to low tech, but all will be sustainable and local. </p>
<p>This project will benefit residents, the surrounding community, the environment, and hopefully generate ideas and personalities that will have a positive impact on the world. The idea is not only to provide action and services, but to conduct research and develop ideas that can be copied to encourage sustainable living. It may not be feasible for modern people in developed countries to manage their own livestock and gardens and home and children; the community model grants access to all of the resources and services while also allowing for residents who so chose to work part or full time outside the community   </p>
