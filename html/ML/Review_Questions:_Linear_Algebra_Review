<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Last_question">Last question</span></h2>
<p>I am confused with the answers I received for the last question! I believe there is only one correct answer, but the system told me there are three correct answers. Is this OK?</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Answer">Answer</span></h3>
<p>The last question is as follows:  </p>
<p>Let A and B be 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following must necessarily hold true?<br />
Is this the question you are referring to?<br />
This has two correct answers.</p>
<p>When given space to type the answer, just enter the answer -- don't "show your work". (I did and the computer graded it wrong with the correct answer shown on other side of equal sign!)</p>
<p>There were two correct answers in the options I was given. If my memory holds good, one was A+B=B+A and the other one was (A<em>B)</em>A=A<em>(B</em>A)</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_matrices">Writing matrices</span></h2>
<p>I don't know how to write the answer to question 4. I tried to represent a 1x3 matrix by writing [10 20 -15] (not the actual numbers). The results came back as wrong, but it gave no explanation, so I don't know if my calculations or my syntax are inaccurate.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Answer_2">Answer</span></h3>
<p>I had this same issue at first.  Double-check the expected dimensions of your matrix multiplication.  Hint: if <em>A</em> is a matrix with dimensions <em>n</em>x<em>m</em> and <em>B</em> is a matrix with dimensions <em>m</em>x<em>p</em>, what will be the dimensions of the product <em>AB</em>?</p>
<p>Please note that system also expects you to input a single real number instead of a 1x1 matrix. This is not correct (since number is not the same as a 1x1 matrix), but this is how checking works (as of November 4th, 2015).</p>
