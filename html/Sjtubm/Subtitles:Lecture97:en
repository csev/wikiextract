1
00:00:00,000 --&gt; 00:00:05,000
Hello, everybody, the last class we discussed the five elements of TCM

2
00:00:05,000 --&gt; 00:00:08,000
This time we will discuss the five elements theory from a modern perspective

3
00:00:08,000 --&gt; 00:00:11,000
We will start our discussion in the following three aspects

4
00:00:11,000 --&gt; 00:00:14,000
first, the rationality of the five elements theory 

5
00:00:14,000 --&gt; 00:00:17,000
second, the limitation of the Five Elements Theory

6
00:00:17,000 --&gt; 00:00:19,000
third, the implications of the Five Elements Theory

7
00:00:19,000 --&gt; 00:00:25,000
So to start with, let us see the diagram of the five elements which we have discussed before

8
00:00:25,000 --&gt; 00:00:30,000
it takes much energy and wisdom of our ancestors to sum up and make the diagram

9
00:00:30,000 --&gt; 00:00:35,000
whether it is scientific or not depends on the standard of the assessment 

10
00:00:35,000 --&gt; 00:00:42,000
For thousands of years, we have been using this systematic theory

11
00:00:42,000 --&gt; 00:00:47,000
To understand human physiology, pathology and to understand the change and development of the nature

12
00:00:47,000 --&gt; 00:00:52,000
Indeed it can be used to solve problems,which is considered rational

13
00:00:52,000 --&gt; 00:00:55,000
So as for reasonableness, let us first see

14
00:00:55,000 --&gt; 00:00:59,000
It can explain the impact of seasonal climate on human health

15
00:00:59,000 --&gt; 00:01:03,000
For example, when discussing the relationship between the time or the season and human health

16
00:01:03,000 --&gt; 00:01:10,000
We divided the year into five different seasons,that is, spring, summer, long summer, autumn and winter

17
00:01:10,000 --&gt; 00:01:13,000
following the cold winter, spring arrives

18
00:01:13,000 --&gt; 00:01:16,000
People should gradually take off the heavy coat

19
00:01:16,000 --&gt; 00:01:19,000
Stretch out, and take a walk in the garden

20
00:01:19,000 --&gt; 00:01:24,000
it is good for health. long summer is the time between summer and autumn 

21
00:01:24,000 --&gt; 00:01:28,000
it is a season characterized by hot and humid weather 

22
00:01:28,000 --&gt; 00:01:30,000
People are most vulnerable to humid in summer

23
00:01:30,000 --&gt; 00:01:37,000
suffering from symptoms like thick and yellow tongue, anorexia, dyspepsia, etc.

24
00:01:37,000 --&gt; 00:01:42,000
if you have poor stomach, eating some soothing food for the humid summer appropriately 

25
00:01:42,000 --&gt; 00:01:46,000
or some TCM, may be helpful 

26
00:01:46,000 --&gt; 00:01:51,000
Such food is as: barley, rugosa, lentils, Poria, watermelon, etc.

27
00:01:51,000 --&gt; 00:01:55,000
because the fall is a dry season

28
00:01:55,000 --&gt; 00:02:00,000
According to the correspondence between the five elements, Yin lung is easily hurt due to dryness 

29
00:02:00,000 --&gt; 00:02:05,000
patients may get heavier dry cough or lung disease

30
00:02:05,000 --&gt; 00:02:10,000 
there will be a some dry constipation because Lung and Large Intestine are closely related to each other

31
00:02:10,000 --&gt; 00:02:14,000
Then take some rock sugar stew pears, melon, etc.in moderation

32
00:02:14,000 --&gt; 00:02:17,000
Yin－soothing products can improve these symptoms

33
00:02:17,000 --&gt; 00:02:20,000
Then second, it can explain

34
00:02:20,000 --&gt; 00:02:23,000
some close relations among viscera, organs and tissues

35
00:02:23,000 --&gt; 00:02:27,000
for example such phenomena does exist in human body

36
00:02:27,000 --&gt; 00:02:31,000
 for instance,the liver and gall bladder are closely related in physiology and pathology

37
00:02:31,000 --&gt; 00:02:38,000
And liver opens into the eyes. liver and gallbladder disease was first observed from the eyes

38
00:02:38,000 --&gt; 00:02:43,000
Such as jaundice hepatitis, heart and small intestine so closely linked

39
00:02:43,000 --&gt; 00:02:45,000
The heart is of the main vein, and the tongue is the orifice of the heart

40
00:02:45,000 --&gt; 00:02:50,000
lung and large intestine is interior-exteriorly related, with lung controlling skin and hair. The nose is the orifice of the lung

41
00:02:50,000 --&gt; 00:02:53,000
Kidneys belongs to shui, bladder is relative to kidney

42
00:02:53,000 --&gt; 00:02:56,000
then Kidneys support bone, and ears are the orifice of kidneys and around the front and back yin

43
00:02:56,000 --&gt; 00:02:59,000
third,the rationality also lies in

44
00:02:59,000 --&gt; 00:03:02,000 
applied the principle of five elements to TCM emotional therapy

45
00:03:02,000 --&gt; 00:03:05,000
For example, there is a saying that: &quot;anger damages liver, and grief hurts more.&quot;

46
00:03:05,000 --&gt; 00:03:07,000
happiness hurts heart,and fear hurts more

47
00:03:07,000 --&gt; 00:03:10,000
missing injures spleen, and anger injures more

48
00:03:10,000 --&gt; 00:03:13,000
worrying injures lung, but happiness injures more

49
00:03:13,000 --&gt; 00:03:15,000
so fear injures kidney, and at the same time missing is more harmful than fear 

50
00:03:15,000 --&gt; 00:03:19,000
Then the five elements theory also has its limitations

51
00:03:19,000 --&gt; 00:03:24,000
to start with, because the five elements theory

52
00:03:24,000 --&gt; 00:03:28,000
is limited to the Central Plains regional culture, the five elements theory we are talking about 

53
00:03:28,000 --&gt; 00:03:32,000
in terms of direction,it refers to zhongtu of china

54
00:03:32,000 --&gt; 00:03:36,000
zhongtu refers to a large area of the Central Plains region

55
00:03:36,000 --&gt; 00:03:38,000
from Gansu province in the west to the East China Sea in the east 

56
00:03:38,000 --&gt; 00:03:41,000
from Inner Mongolia in the North, Hebei province, to the Yangtze River in the south 

57
00:03:41,000 --&gt; 00:03:43,000
These are zhongtu area in china

58
00:03:43,000 --&gt; 00:03:46,000
The Five ideas is generated from the Central Plains culture

59
00:03:46,000 --&gt; 00:03:49,000
which Was consistent with the definition of direction

60
00:03:49,000 --&gt; 00:03:53,000
but for southern people,these definition of direction

61
00:03:53,000 --&gt; 00:03:57,000
such as hainan people or yunnan people, would be different in connotation

62
00:03:57,000 --&gt; 00:04:00,000
So why did we say that TCM has his cultural identity

63
00:04:00,000 --&gt; 00:04:03,000
it is closely related to the Central Plains culture

64
00:04:03,000 --&gt; 00:04:08,000
if we apply the law of season and direction of The Five ideas to the southern hemisphere

65
00:04:08,000 --&gt; 00:04:11,000
for instance in Australia, it is not the case 

66
00:04:11,000 --&gt; 00:04:15,000
The second kind of limitation is that: limitations of ethnic complexion

67
00:04:15,000 --&gt; 00:04:16,000
For example

68
00:04:16,000 --&gt; 00:04:20,000
when Chinese people go to see a doctor, attentions are often paid to a person's face changes

69
00:04:20,000 --&gt; 00:04:23,000
If they are from the South asia or African

70
00:04:23,000 --&gt; 00:04:26,000
it is not easy to identify because their own skin colour

71
00:04:26,000 --&gt; 00:04:31,000
is relatively deep, and the five elements theory is based on the relation between colour and human organs

72
00:04:31,000 --&gt; 00:04:35,000器官等生理病理 那么这样一个
Physiology and pathology

73
00:04:35,000 --&gt; 00:04:42,000
we lack of sufficient experience over other colour groups

74
00:04:42,000 --&gt; 00:04:44,000
Therefore, it calls for more exploration

75
00:04:44,000 --&gt; 00:04:49,000
And the third part of the five elements is that his conclusion

76
00:04:49,000 --&gt; 00:04:54,000
Regularity conclusion is sketchy, as timbre only has five sound 

77
00:04:54,000 --&gt; 00:04:57,000
it is commonly used in Chinese classical music. people tended to 

78
00:04:57,000 --&gt; 00:05:02,000
use a tone deaf to represent when Someone does not have a strong sense of music

79
00:05:02,000 --&gt; 00:05:05,000
This is the reason.but the modern piano and other musical instruments

80
00:05:05,000 --&gt; 00:05:09,000
have far more than five tones, at least seven tones

81
00:05:09,000 --&gt; 00:05:11,000
it could be more if we calculate by Chromatic

82
00:05:11,000 --&gt; 00:05:15,000
Similarly, there are more than five kinds of colour, taste and pulse

83
00:05:15,000 --&gt; 00:05:19,000
Because of the limited nature of the five elements themselves

84
00:05:19,000 --&gt; 00:05:22,000
One can only select five to be considered

85
00:05:22,000 --&gt; 00:05:26,000
so third, we are talking about the revelation of the Five Elements Theory

86
00:05:26,000 --&gt; 00:05:31,000
later we will discuss, given that the five elements theory has limitations

87
00:05:31,000 --&gt; 00:05:37,000
whether we can say the Five Elements theory is useless, or even pseudo-science?

88
00:05:37,000 --&gt; 00:05:39,000
I do not agree with this view

89
00:05:39,000 --&gt; 00:05:43,000
I think we should analyze rationally both the reasonableness and the limitations of the five elements  theory

90
00:05:43,000 --&gt; 00:05:45,000
select to apply and absorb

91
00:05:45,000 --&gt; 00:05:48,000
More importantly, through the analysis of the five elements theory

92
00:05:48,000 --&gt; 00:05:51,000
What enlightenment can be brought to us 

93
00:05:51,000 --&gt; 00:05:57,000
which is able to better utilized in research and practice in the field of health activities

94
00:05:57,000 --&gt; 00:06:00,000
When comparing with other ethnic medicine

95
00:06:00,000 --&gt; 00:06:05,000
we may find that the system different traditional medicine take will vary

96
00:06:05,000 --&gt; 00:06:08,000
such as the ancient Greek four liquid theory,

97
00:06:08,000 --&gt; 00:06:11,000
water,fire,soil and air&quot; Four Elements in the Indian medicine 

98
00:06:11,000 --&gt; 00:06:15,000
four towers five aggregates&quot; theory in China Dai medicine 

99
00:06:15,000 --&gt; 00:06:20,000
long, Tripa, Bacon&quot; three cause theory in Tibetan medicine 

100
00:06:20,000 --&gt; 00:06:23,000
And &quot;water, fire, soil, gas, and air&quot; five source theory

101
00:06:23,000 --&gt; 00:06:30,000
So though there are differences among these theories, in history

102
00:06:30,000 --&gt; 00:06:35,000
or even today these can be used in health care, prevention and treatment of diseases 

103
00:06:35,000 --&gt; 00:06:39,000
What do they have in common? it lies in that by using diversified

104
00:06:39,000 --&gt; 00:06:43,000
systematic methods we can understand human body and the nature

105
00:06:43,000 --&gt; 00:06:47,000
just like binary and decimal and hexadecimal

106
00:06:47,000 --&gt; 00:06:51,000
There are a variety of bands, which can solve similar problems

107
00:06:51,000 --&gt; 00:06:54,000
So when designing a computer program 

108
00:06:54,000 --&gt; 00:06:56,000
you can use different ways

109
00:06:56,000 --&gt; 00:06:59,000
by Different languages&#160;??to we design and solve the same problem

110
00:06:59,000 --&gt; 00:07:03,000
It is entirely possible, but among these methods

111
00:07:03,000 --&gt; 00:07:07,000
Some may be faster, some may be slower

112
00:07:07,000 --&gt; 00:07:13,000
you will find a more suitable approach to satisfy your research needs

113
00:07:13,000 --&gt; 00:07:15,000
list another simpler example

114
00:07:15,000 --&gt; 00:07:16,000
For example, from Shanghai to Haikou

115
00:07:16,000 --&gt; 00:07:22,000
You can either take a train,a plane or the car

116
00:07:22,000 --&gt; 00:07:25,000
Or you can have combination transportation of aircraft, ship, or train

117
00:07:25,000 --&gt; 00:07:27,000
to arrive at the destination

118
00:07:27,000 --&gt; 00:07:33,000
The five elements of five elements theory inside is composed of a pentagonal star system  

119
00:07:33,000 --&gt; 00:07:37,000
Then within the system they develop with and restrain from each other

120
00:07:37,000 --&gt; 00:07:42,000
Any line is undergoing close relationship with the other four lines

121
00:07:42,000 --&gt; 00:07:45,000
only in this way can ensure that this system is in steady state

122
00:07:45,000 --&gt; 00:07:49,000
modern medicine has undergone 1-to-1 rapid development for a long time

123
00:07:49,000 --&gt; 00:07:53,000
we gradually became aware of the limitations of solving complex health issues 

124
00:07:53,000 --&gt; 00:07:56,000
issues including drug side effects, etc.

125
00:07:56,000 --&gt; 00:07:59,000
recently a new research direction has been proposed 

126
00:07:59,000 --&gt; 00:08:04,000
network pharmacology, which aims to conduct drug research through a systematic approach

127
00:08:04,000 --&gt; 00:08:10,000
and to reduce the drug side effects. this is generated from new ideas based on systematic thinking 

128
00:08:10,000 --&gt; 00:08:14,000
besides, systematic biomedical research is also popular,

129
00:08:14,000 --&gt; 00:08:20,000
The fundamental reason is that the idea of&#160;??using the system to learn to solve this dilemma faced  by modern medicine

130
00:08:20,000 --&gt; 00:08:26,000
In short, the five elements of Chinese medicine theory is the systematic way to solve complex health problems 

131
00:08:26,000 --&gt; 00:08:29,000
it demonstrates the effectiveness of the systematic approach

132
00:08:29,000 --&gt; 00:08:34,000
offering a healthy thinking pattern to resolve health and medicine problems in the future 

133
00:08:34,000 --&gt; 00:08:37,000
let us stop here

134
00:08:37,000 --&gt; 00:08:41,000
In fact, the entire content of five elements theory section

135
00:08:41,000 --&gt; 00:08:43,000
comes to an end completely after this lesson 

136
00:08:43,000 --&gt; 00:08:49,000 
Next time we will discuss the core of TCM theory 

137
00:08:49,000 --&gt; 00:08:51,000
that is，Viscera，main and collateral channels theory
