﻿1
00:00:00,720 --&gt; 00:00:04,476
Hello everyone last time we discussed the origin of the yin and yang ideas

2
00:00:05,028 --&gt; 00:00:09,362
this time I’d like to focus on the core of yin and yang idea

3
00:00:10,154 --&gt; 00:00:13,359
The class will discuss it in five aspects

4
00:00:13,674 --&gt; 00:00:15,435
one is the separability of yin and yang

5
00:00:16,268 --&gt; 00:00:17,907
Then the opposition of yin and yang

6
00:00:18,380 --&gt; 00:00:20,283
then the complementary of yin and yang

7
00:00:20,837 --&gt; 00:00:23,465
the ebb and flow and transformation of yin and yang

8
00:00:23,779 --&gt; 00:00:30,252
So these are contained &quot;yin and yang fish&quot; pattern created by ancient Chinese sages

9
00:00:31,803 --&gt; 00:00:35,696
to be specific, let us first talk about the separability of yin and yang

10
00:00:36,394 --&gt; 00:00:42,372
the separability refers to the concept that any thing belongs to either &quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;Yang&quot;

11
00:00:42,928 --&gt; 00:00:44,717
it has two meanings

12
00:00:45,096 --&gt; 00:00:46,507
the first means that

13
00:00:46,507 --&gt; 00:00:51,415
Anything can be identified by the standard of yin and yang properties

14
00:00:51,690 --&gt; 00:01:03,461
such thing as day, hot, rising,energy, agitation, bright, sports
Upward, outward, male, etc.

15
00:01:03,461 --&gt; 00:01:09,354
possess the characteristics of yang,therefore it is yang(positive)

16
00:01:09,860 --&gt; 00:01:22,666
And on the contrary,things and phenomenons like night, cold,decline, substance
depression, introverted nature, darkness,stillness etc. are of female characteristics

17
00:01:22,666 --&gt; 00:01:25,835
which are of the characteristics of yin, and thus can be attributed to Yin

18
00:01:26,298 --&gt; 00:01:29,589
the second one refers to the re-divisibility of yin and yang

19
00:01:29,912 --&gt; 00:01:32,267
that is Both yin and yang can be further divided into yin and yang

20
00:01:33,102 --&gt; 00:01:35,277
For example, we can see in the yin and yang fish

21
00:01:36,115 --&gt; 00:01:39,204
This sphere can be divided into two parts in black and white

22
00:01:39,853 --&gt; 00:01:42,325
representing the yin and yang respectively

23
00:01:42,833 --&gt; 00:01:46,941
But when there are black dots in the White part, representing yin exists in yang there

24
00:01:47,122 --&gt; 00:01:50,556
while the white dots in the black represents that yin exists in yang

25
00:01:50,914 --&gt; 00:01:55,516
Another example is that the night belongs to yin while daylight belongs to yang

26
00:01:55,932 --&gt; 00:02:04,880
The day also has both yin and yang.morning is the yang in yang while afternoon is yin out of yang

27
00:02:05,518 --&gt; 00:02:09,132
second,let’s talk about the opposition of yin and yang

28
00:02:09,588 --&gt; 00:02:13,069
Then these two things yin and yang are just the opposite

29
00:02:13,627 --&gt; 00:02:15,478
So we call them incompatible

30
00:02:15,759 --&gt; 00:02:17,972
It also has two meanings

31
00:02:18,208 --&gt; 00:02:23,949
The first refers to that any object or phenomenon has yin and yang the two aspects

32
00:02:24,269 --&gt; 00:02:27,402
the two aspects are contradictory

33
00:02:27,770 --&gt; 00:02:38,500
For example, the left and the right,the upper and the lower,the heaven and the earth,moving and stillness
in and out,rise and fall,day and night,light and dark 

34
00:02:38,500 --&gt; 00:02:42,103
even cold and heat, water and fire, etc.

35
00:02:42,325 --&gt; 00:02:46,945
So these are opposites just like the yin and yang.such laws prevail in nature

36
00:02:47,316 --&gt; 00:02:52,471
The second refers to that the opposing sides of yin and yang

37
00:02:52,711 --&gt; 00:02:55,574
Mostly of restrain each other

38
00:02:56,162 --&gt; 00:02:59,335
So the opposing sides inhibit and restrain each other 

39
00:02:59,752 --&gt; 00:03:02,474
reflecting intricate dynamic link

40
00:03:02,845 --&gt; 00:03:06,304
let us set climate change in the four seasons as an example

41
00:03:06,759 --&gt; 00:03:14,034
the reason why it gradually becomes warm in spring and hot in summer 

42
00:03:14,354 --&gt; 00:03:22,795
is Mainly that changes in the relative positions between the Sun and the Earth strengthens warm streams in the northern hemisphere   

43
00:03:23,125 --&gt; 00:03:25,618
Inhibiting the cold streams from the north

44
00:03:25,888 --&gt; 00:03:32,605
this yin-yang battle between Warm, cold streams makes the peak line it gradually advance to higher latitudes

45
00:03:32,882 --&gt; 00:03:38,485
The reason why it gradually becomes cool in fall and it is of low temperatures in cold winter 

46
00:03:38,807 --&gt; 00:03:44,023
Is that the increasingly cold streams inhibit the warm air from the south

47
00:03:44,351 --&gt; 00:03:49,209
the yin-yang battle peak line gradually migrates to low latitudes

48
00:03:49,403 --&gt; 00:03:53,224
This is a typical example of mutual restraint in yin and yang in the nature

49
00:03:53,687 --&gt; 00:04:01,683
That temperatures depend on the yin-yang confrontation between warm streams and cold streams

50
00:04:02,095 --&gt; 00:04:04,232
So in the &quot;Yellow Emperor&quot; it stresses that 

51
00:04:04,552 --&gt; 00:04:13,554
Therefore since the winter solstice lasting for forty five days, more yang and less yin 
since the Summer Solstice lasting for forty five days, less yang and more yin

52
00:04:13,964 --&gt; 00:04:20,098
Then the &quot;forty-five days&quot; refers to the time from winter solstice to the beginning of spring,and from summer solstice to the beginning of the autumn 

53
00:04:21,262 --&gt; 00:04:28,686
From the winter solstice to the beginning of spring,yang air gradually moves northward while yin air is inhibited and tends to remove from northwards

54
00:04:29,095 --&gt; 00:04:35,864
The summer is the heyday of yang, with yin hiding, resulting high temperatures 

55
00:04:36,134 --&gt; 00:04:39,963
From the summer solstice to the beginning of autumn,yin gradually strengthens and prevails 

56
00:04:40,227 --&gt; 00:04:45,229
Yang is suppressed and gradually retreat southward. from this time to winter

57
00:04:45,465 --&gt; 00:04:50,811
the temperature varies with the heyday of yin and the lurking of yang 

58
00:04:51,132 --&gt; 00:04:55,301
Temperature changes is manifested in this opposition and constraints of yin and yang

59
00:04:55,711 --&gt; 00:04:58,805
changes happen in circles like this year after year

60
00:04:59,301 --&gt; 00:05:04,366
third,we will talk about the interaction and interoperability of yin and yang

61
00:05:04,630 --&gt; 00:05:08,581
it can also be called interdependence between yin and yang

62
00:05:08,862 --&gt; 00:05:14,683
this means that is opposite sides both regard each other as the premise of its own existence

63
00:05:14,683 --&gt; 00:05:17,141
Showing interdependence

64
00:05:17,410 --&gt; 00:05:21,386
neither party can exist alone without the other

65
00:05:21,715 --&gt; 00:05:25,944
For example, upwards is yang while downwards is yin. there is no downwards without upwards

66
00:05:28,743 --&gt; 00:05:30,584
no downwards, then no upwards

67
00:05:31,330 --&gt; 00:05:37,398
left is yang, while right means yin.no left,no right.also no right, no left

68
00:05:37,723 --&gt; 00:05:41,629
all of such things illustrate interdependence of yin and yang

69
00:05:41,902 --&gt; 00:05:47,890
And each party exists because of the other’s existence

70
00:05:48,876 --&gt; 00:05:53,750
the second meaning of the interaction and interoperability of yin and yang is that on the basis of the interdependence of yin and yang 

71
00:05:54,113 --&gt; 00:06:00,095
to some extent, Yin and yang boast the characteristics of mutual development and utilization

72
00:06:00,506 --&gt; 00:06:05,322
For example, the ancients said: &quot;gas on the ground goes up to form cloud, while the gas in the air goes down as rain&quot;

73
00:06:05,701 --&gt; 00:06:08,475
This process is mutually antagonistic and interdependent

74
00:06:08,796 --&gt; 00:06:11,224
mutually developing and reinforcing 

75
00:06:11,697 --&gt; 00:06:16,026
The rise of gas on the ground can mix the water vapor to form cloud 

76
00:06:16,026 --&gt; 00:06:20,816
the rain is generated from the clouds which are formed by gas rising

77
00:06:20,816 --&gt; 00:06:27,485
The fall of gas in the air often leads to rainfall which moisture the ground with water vapour

78
00:06:27,746 --&gt; 00:06:35,941
so the cycle of gas,clouds,rain and weather represents the mutually developing and reinforcing effect of yin and yang

79
00:06:36,832 --&gt; 00:06:38,032
So an ancient saying goes that

80
00:06:38,032 --&gt; 00:06:48,261
Yin and yang base on each other.
No yang, then yin depends on nothing to exist and vice versa.

81
00:06:48,675 --&gt; 00:06:52,333
fourth, we are going to talk about the ebb and flow of yin and yang

82
00:06:52,795 --&gt; 00:06:56,310
Ebb and flow represent the form of yin-yang movement

83
00:06:56,634 --&gt; 00:07:00,049
so called “xiao” means decrease and consumption

84
00:07:00,327 --&gt; 00:07:03,678
so called “zhang” means increase and development

85
00:07:04,090 --&gt; 00:07:05,819
This refers to changes in the number

86
00:07:06,145 --&gt; 00:07:10,497
So the opposite yin and yang are not in static state

87
00:07:10,868 --&gt; 00:07:13,737
Instead is constantly changing

88
00:07:14,058 --&gt; 00:07:19,598
in the basic form that while one grows, the other eliminate

89
00:07:20,246 --&gt; 00:07:24,379
fifth, we will talk about the transformation of yin and yang

90
00:07:24,693 --&gt; 00:07:33,084
yin and yang opposites sides in things under certain conditions may change into the opposite

91
00:07:33,448 --&gt; 00:07:39,337
during the day-and-night change and seasonal transition in nature

92
00:07:39,337 --&gt; 00:07:43,179
Yin-yang transformation of the climate is the most common example

93
00:07:43,606 --&gt; 00:07:50,486
set circadian replacement as an example. as the sun rises,yang gas goes up and it gradually becomes warm

94
00:07:50,755 --&gt; 00:07:56,720
as the sun sets,yin gas goes up and it gradually becomes cool

95
00:07:58,114 --&gt; 00:08:05,571
For example, at noon (11:00-13:00) it is the peak of yang gas in a day

96
00:08:05,904 --&gt; 00:08:10,029
after that yang gradually decreases while yin increases 

97
00:08:10,822 --&gt; 00:08:17,022
till zishi,that is, the midnight(23:00-1:00),yin reaches the highest

98
00:08:17,350 --&gt; 00:08:24,325
After that yang begins to rise slowly and then starts to grow again in circle

99
00:08:24,932 --&gt; 00:08:30,194
set the seasonal transition as an example. from warm spring to hot summer

100
00:08:30,519 --&gt; 00:08:33,913
we also experience such a process that ”Yin diminishes and Yang grows”

101
00:08:35,786 --&gt; 00:08:41,999
So the summer solstice is the time when the yang reaches peak

102
00:08:41,999 --&gt; 00:08:45,806
and the winter solstice is the time when yin reaches the highest

103
00:08:46,082 --&gt; 00:08:50,829
it represents the yin-yang transformation movement in circle

104
00:08:51,068 --&gt; 00:08:53,617
Then a relatively stable climate is formed 

105
00:08:53,617 --&gt; 00:08:59,421
it is suitable for human to reproduce and other creatures to grow

106
00:08:59,697 --&gt; 00:09:01,618
resulting in biodiversity

107
00:09:02,493 --&gt; 00:09:10,088
However, the ebb and flow and transformation of yin and yang occurs because of the fact that yin and yang is mutually opposing and interoperable

108
00:09:10,088 --&gt; 00:09:17,357
So the Yin-Yang thought teaches us a basic law of the occurrence,development and decline 

109
00:09:17,547 --&gt; 00:09:23,068
So above all five aspects are the core ideas of yin and yang

110
00:09:23,300 --&gt; 00:09:25,539
let us stop here

111
00:09:25,815 --&gt; 00:09:30,642
the next time we will focus on the yin-yang thought contained in Chinese traditional medicine
