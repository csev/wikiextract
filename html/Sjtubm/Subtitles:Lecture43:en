1
00:00:00,200 --&gt; 00:00:09,751
Glad to see you all. This class we will talk about the fifth chapter: theory of Zang-Fu and meridians.

2
00:00:10,272 --&gt; 00:00:13,779
Chinese Medicine believes the core parts of human body are the Zang-Fu, literally means internal organs, 

3
00:00:14,212 --&gt; 00:00:16,489
which is basically in line with modern medicine

4
00:00:16,863 --&gt; 00:00:21,778
Lack of arms or legs are not fatal, but one can not live without Zang-Fu.

5
00:00:21,953 --&gt; 00:00:26,593
If one is without heart, liver or kidney, will he be able to live?

6
00:00:27,124 --&gt; 00:00:29,074
The answer is obvious: no!

7
00:00:29,449 --&gt; 00:00:33,613
That’s because they are the most essential organs of life, and they are indispensable.

8
00:00:34,059 --&gt; 00:00:39,370
Is &quot;Zang-Fu&quot; in Chinese Medicine the same as viscera in modern medicine?

9
00:00:39,745 --&gt; 00:00:45,408
There is an essential difference between these two.

10
00:00:45,866 --&gt; 00:00:49,062
Modern medicine defines viscera from the anatomical point of view

11
00:00:49,434 --&gt; 00:00:53,410
It observes interior human organs, which are different in both tissues and forms,

12
00:00:53,880 --&gt; 00:00:56,690
while Chinese Medicine define Zang-Fu from the functional point of view.

13
00:00:57,061 --&gt; 00:00:59,727
Sometimes, they are quite different from the anatomical concepts.

14
00:01:00,148 --&gt; 00:01:05,578
This class aims to teach you the basic idea of Chinese Medicine's Zang-Fu concepts.

15
00:01:05,953 --&gt; 00:01:07,451
Is there any differences between the internal organs Zang and the hollow organs Fu?

16
00:01:08,149 --&gt; 00:01:10,721
In Chinese Medicine, &quot;Zang-Fu&quot;(internal organs) is the generic term for interior organs

17
00:01:11,371 --&gt; 00:01:13,706
But there is an essential difference between the two

18
00:01:14,145 --&gt; 00:01:16,795
First let’s introduce the five Zang organs in Chinese Medicine

19
00:01:17,451 --&gt; 00:01:21,758
The five Zang organs refer to liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney.

20
00:01:22,202 --&gt; 00:01:23,955
Most of them are parenchymatous organs, full of Jing-Qi (energy)

21
00:01:24,384 --&gt; 00:01:26,110
Their main function is storage,

22
00:01:26,532 --&gt; 00:01:31,542
which means the five Zang organs can store fine and micro substances to sustain life.

23
00:01:31,961 --&gt; 00:01:34,861
(These substances) include Jing (essence), Qi (breath), blood and so on.

24
00:01:35,189 --&gt; 00:01:39,448
Are the heart and lung in Chinese Medicine the same with those in the modern medicine?

25
00:01:39,775 --&gt; 00:01:45,765
Heart and lung, parts of the five Zang organs, are basically the same with their counterparts in modern medicine.

26
00:01:46,493 --&gt; 00:01:48,604
They are more similar in terms of positions and in forms.

27
00:01:49,626 --&gt; 00:01:54,590
A slight distinction is that in TCM, the heart is being wrapped by pericardium

28
00:01:55,107 --&gt; 00:01:59,321
called heart-sac, or Danzhong, which is identified as a separate organ from the heart.

29
00:01:59,793 --&gt; 00:02:05,684
Especially when the pericardium or heart is experiencing pathological changes, the differences are more distinct.

30
00:02:06,058 --&gt; 00:02:07,835
Then is there a huge difference between their functions?

31
00:02:08,370 --&gt; 00:02:10,198
Yes, from the point of its functions

32
00:02:10,659 --&gt; 00:02:15,441
Chinese Medicine believes that except from blood transporting, 

33
00:02:15,906 --&gt; 00:02:19,089
heart also have the function of &quot;Zangshen&quot;, i.e. in charge of sanity 

34
00:02:19,463 --&gt; 00:02:23,347
Or in simple terms, the function of mental and emotional activities.

35
00:02:23,722 --&gt; 00:02:26,482
The lungs, except from the respiratory functions,

36
00:02:26,842 --&gt; 00:02:30,960
also maintains a clear passage for body fluids, and helps with metabolism

37
00:02:31,408 --&gt; 00:02:35,692
People often say that &quot;kidney is the foundation for the innate body and spleen is the foundation for the acquired body&quot; 

38
00:02:36,145 --&gt; 00:02:37,512
There's no similar sayings in modern medicine.

39
00:02:38,099 --&gt; 00:02:42,566
Is that because kidney and spleen in Chinese Medicine are not the same with the organs in modern medicine?

40
00:02:43,127 --&gt; 00:02:44,578
This is a very good question.

41
00:02:45,061 --&gt; 00:02:52,116
Kidney and spleen in TCM is not exactly the same as the organs in modern medicine under anatomy.

42
00:02:52,441 --&gt; 00:02:56,983
Chinese medicine believes that kidney is responsible of: human growth, reproduction,

43
00:02:57,444 --&gt; 00:03:02,037
body fluid metabolism and also helps to provide and tend to the viscera.

44
00:03:02,410 --&gt; 00:03:06,294
From these functions, we can see it is a combination of multiple organs

45
00:03:06,879 --&gt; 00:03:08,562
Aside from kidney in modern medicine

46
00:03:09,029 --&gt; 00:03:13,014
It should also include male’s testicles and some functions of female’s ovary.

47
00:03:13,420 --&gt; 00:03:17,592
Among them kidney is the key part, which is the shared knowledge of generations of therapists.

48
00:03:17,933 --&gt; 00:03:19,932
For example, Huang di’s Canon of Medicine: Su Wen

49
00:03:20,307 --&gt; 00:03:22,881
And Yi Guan all mentioned that

50
00:03:23,258 --&gt; 00:03:27,562
&quot;(kidney) is under the fourteenth vertebra, the width of each is 1.5 fen

51
00:03:28,040 --&gt; 00:03:33,282
The shape is like two face-to-face and curved cowpeas, cling to the backbone and is covered by yellow grease.&quot;

52
00:03:33,609 --&gt; 00:03:38,104
This is the same with the anatomical kidney

53
00:03:38,547 --&gt; 00:03:39,599
And the spleen?

54
00:03:39,976 --&gt; 00:03:42,641
Chinese Medicine believes the spleen has two main functions

55
00:03:43,016 --&gt; 00:03:47,602
One is to govern digestive functions and the other to govern blood transporting

56
00:03:48,224 --&gt; 00:03:51,547
From the functional point of view, instead of looking it as the modern medical spleen

57
00:03:51,874 --&gt; 00:03:54,076
We should rather call it the modern digestive system

58
00:03:54,571 --&gt; 00:04:00,016
It including stomach, liver, pancreas and intestinal digestive and absorptive functions

59
00:04:00,457 --&gt; 00:04:03,900
And it also has the function of governing blood, which has no claim in modern medicine.

60
00:04:04,481 --&gt; 00:04:06,011
So what are fu, namely the hollow organs?

61
00:04:06,498 --&gt; 00:04:09,564
We just mentioned the Chinese five internal organs

62
00:04:10,050 --&gt; 00:04:15,087
Now we talk about Chinese five hollow organs: gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, bladder and sanjiao

63
00:04:15,508 --&gt; 00:04:20,001
Morphologically, they are hollow and not full of energy as &quot;Zang&quot;

64
00:04:20,466 --&gt; 00:04:24,306
Functionally, they can not generate and deposit energy like &quot;Zang&quot;

65
00:04:24,800 --&gt; 00:04:26,838
They have the function of transforming and storing essence.

66
00:04:27,212 --&gt; 00:04:32,265
Here whether the stomach, small intestine and large intestine are overlapped with the spleen?

67
00:04:32,744 --&gt; 00:04:36,101
This is a good question and ostensibly, they are.

68
00:04:36,607 --&gt; 00:04:39,985
But actually Chinese Medicine resolved the functions of stomach and intestines

69
00:04:40,443 --&gt; 00:04:46,443
And distribute the functions of transporting food and chyle to the stomach, small intestine and large intestine, namely three of the five hollow organs

70
00:04:46,822 --&gt; 00:04:50,280
And the digestive and absorptive functions to spleen

71
00:04:50,654 --&gt; 00:04:52,297
Then what are the functions of gallbladder?

72
00:04:52,859 --&gt; 00:04:57,535
From modern medicine’s point of view, gallbladder has the function of deposit and secrete bile

73
00:04:57,908 --&gt; 00:05:00,533
When needed, it will secrete bile into intestines

74
00:05:00,951 --&gt; 00:05:03,198
When non-needed, it will conserve it in the cholecyst

75
00:05:03,663 --&gt; 00:05:06,150
Yi Xue Jian Neng mentioned that

76
00:05:06,520 --&gt; 00:05:11,202
&quot;Gallbladder, one of the five hollow organs, belongs to the wood, mainly functions to ascend the clear and descend the turbid and smooth the middle earth&quot;

77
00:05:11,737 --&gt; 00:05:16,161
Compared with liver, it has the functions of &quot;Fu&quot;the five hollow organs, so Chinese Medicine allots it to the five hollow organs.

78
00:05:16,687 --&gt; 00:05:19,205
But at the same time, it has the function of conserving essence

79
00:05:19,626 --&gt; 00:05:26,505
So it was called extraordinary organs along with the brain, cell, marrow, bone and vein.

80
00:05:26,926 --&gt; 00:05:28,142
Because they share some similarities

81
00:05:28,620 --&gt; 00:05:33,945
Morphologically, it is hollow like the five hollow organs. Functionally, it conserves essence, like five internal organs

82
00:05:34,361 --&gt; 00:05:36,509
What is Sanjiao?

83
00:05:36,946 --&gt; 00:05:41,004
According to the five elements, Chinese medicine only has five internal organs and five hollow organs, and Sanjiao is not included.

84
00:05:41,741 --&gt; 00:05:45,218
Actually Sanjiao is not at the same classification level as the five internal organs(Zang) and the five hollow organs(Fu)

85
00:05:45,920 --&gt; 00:05:48,490
Huang di’s Canon of Medicine: Su Wen: Ling Lan Mi Dian mentioned that

86
00:05:48,912 --&gt; 00:05:51,537
&quot;Sanjiao, the functional organ which governs the body fluid’s channeling&quot;

87
00:05:51,998 --&gt; 00:05:55,843
which means that Sanjiao spreads all over human thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity

88
00:05:56,312 --&gt; 00:06:00,284
And is the channel of blood, qi and other body fluids

89
00:06:00,706 --&gt; 00:06:06,745
Traditionally, Shangjiao means the parts above the diaphragm, including heart and lung.

90
00:06:07,239 --&gt; 00:06:11,097
The so called smoky Shangjiao refers to its dispersing function

91
00:06:11,609 --&gt; 00:06:15,870
which makes qi, blood and body fluids all over the body like smoke

92
00:06:16,397 --&gt; 00:06:22,472
Zhongjiao lies under the diaphragm and above navel, including spleen and stomach

93
00:06:22,945 --&gt; 00:06:27,616
When they transporting and transforming decomposed food, the food will be digested.

94
00:06:28,096 --&gt; 00:06:31,969
So bubbly Zhongjiao refers to its digestive function

95
00:06:32,465 --&gt; 00:06:36,555
Xiaojiao, lies below the navel, includes liver, kidney and bladder

96
00:06:37,004 --&gt; 00:06:42,686
So Channeling Xiajiao refers to its excretory function

97
00:06:43,193 --&gt; 00:06:48,207
From the discussion, we can basically draw the following conclusions.

98
00:06:48,582 --&gt; 00:06:54,486
First, Chinese Medicine built the human body model based on viscera

99
00:06:54,949 --&gt; 00:07:00,471
Second, the viscera in Chinese Medicine are morphologically 

100
00:07:00,847 --&gt; 00:07:04,216
Different from the modern medicine

101
00:07:04,590 --&gt; 00:07:08,897
Knowing these two points, we know the nature of Chinese viscera

102
00:07:09,381 --&gt; 00:07:15,352
That is all for today. Next we will further our discussion on the theory of visceral main and collateral.
