00:00:01,028 --&gt; 00:00:08,048
Hi. everyone. From this class on, we'll discuss final part of the chapter: theory of medicinal property.

2
00:00:08,280 --&gt; 00:00:10,388
We will discuss it from three aspects,

3
00:00:10,668 --&gt; 00:00:16,518
including the theory of property and flavour of TCM, the floating and settling theory of TCM and finally the theory of toxicity of TCM.

4
00:00:16,797 --&gt; 00:00:21,808
In this lecture, the theory of property and flavour of TCM will be discussed in detail.

5
00:00:22,132 --&gt; 00:00:26,813
Ginseng is a kind of TCM drug which many of you are familiar with.

6
00:00:27,093 --&gt; 00:00:30,090
In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP), China's national medical standard,

7
00:00:30,370 --&gt; 00:00:32,478
there is such a description saying

8
00:00:32,805 --&gt; 00:00:37,907
&quot;[Ginseng is gan, weiku, ping] sweet, a little bitter and even in flavour. It is often used in the treatment of spleen, lung and heart.&quot;

9
00:00:38,231 --&gt; 00:00:41,743
Well, who can tell what does this description really mean?

10
00:00:42,022 --&gt; 00:00:44,785
&quot;Gan&quot;in the Chinese has similar meaning with &quot;sweet&quot;.

11
00:00:45,113 --&gt; 00:00:47,872
那么“甘、微苦”应该就是药材的味道。
Therefore &quot;Gan, weiku (sweet with slight bitter)&quot; should be the flavor of ginseng.

12
00:00:48,155 --&gt; 00:00:51,149
It is not very clear what &quot;ping (even)&quot; means here.

13
00:00:51,430 --&gt; 00:00:56,485
The old often say that ginseng is both slightly sweet and bitter.

14
00:00:56,770 --&gt; 00:00:59,481
So people would often add some sugar when stewing ginseng.

15
00:00:59,714 --&gt; 00:01:04,301
Well, now &quot;gan&quot; means sweet and ginseng is both sweet and bitter.

16
00:01:04,534 --&gt; 00:01:06,031
You might wonder how indeed such a mix of flavours tastes. 

17
00:01:06,266 --&gt; 00:01:11,042
I brought some samples of ginseng with me. You can try by yourself. 

18
00:01:42,069 --&gt; 00:01:45,440
Have you got any sense of how it tastes like?

19
00:01:45,811 --&gt; 00:01:46,984
astringent?

20
00:01:47,264 --&gt; 00:01:48,760
Somewhat astringent?

21
00:01:48,994 --&gt; 00:01:49,603
But still a little bit sweet?

22
00:01:49,837 --&gt; 00:01:50,538
Yes, also sweet.

23
00:01:50,772 --&gt; 00:01:53,163
So it is both sweet and bitter.

24
00:01:53,394 --&gt; 00:01:54,702
Does it really taste bitter?

25
00:01:54,892 --&gt; 00:01:55,826
A bit.

26
00:01:56,015 --&gt; 00:01:56,389
A little bit.

27
00:01:56,670 --&gt; 00:02:01,119
Ok. So your taste just now implies that

28
00:02:01,350 --&gt; 00:02:09,869
&quot;Gan, weiku (Sweet with slight bitter)&quot; accords with the flavour of a drug.

29
00:02:10,101 --&gt; 00:02:13,335
Actually,  the &quot;property and flavour&quot; of TCM

30
00:02:13,570 --&gt; 00:02:20,122
does not necessarily behave so compatibly like ginseng.  

31
00:02:20,349 --&gt; 00:02:23,393
It has something to do with the theory of drug properties of TCM.

32
00:02:23,676 --&gt; 00:02:29,898
Drug properties refer to the properties and performance of a drug, which are innate qualities of TCM.

33
00:02:30,132 --&gt; 00:02:33,267
Xu Lingtai in the Qing Dynasty had made classical remarks that

34
00:02:33,501 --&gt; 00:02:38,791
&quot;When using a certain drug, we are actually using its property or its flavours.

35
00:02:39,025 --&gt; 00:02:44,974
Different drugs should be applied to corresponding diseases with their features,

36
00:02:45,248 --&gt; 00:02:47,917
so that these drugs could help treatment by balancing internal organs.&quot;

37
00:02:48,196 --&gt; 00:02:52,271
This quotation tells the principles of the drug properties.

38
00:02:52,549 --&gt; 00:02:56,015
The message that Xu Lingtai actually conveyed is that

39
00:02:56,292 --&gt; 00:03:00,834
drug properties indeed build a bridge between &quot;medical treatment&quot; and &quot;medicine&quot;.

40
00:03:01,067 --&gt; 00:03:04,154
That is to say, if you know little about the knowledge of drug properties,

41
00:03:04,389 --&gt; 00:03:07,997
you can hardly dispense medicines according to the TCM symptoms.

42
00:03:08,321 --&gt; 00:03:11,412
Well now, the theory of drug properties include

43
00:03:11,645 --&gt; 00:03:16,933
the four kind of properties, five kinds of flavors, floating and settling, channel tropism and toxicity.

44
00:03:17,167 --&gt; 00:03:21,380
Just now we have discussed about &quot;gan, weiku, ping (sweet with slight bitter, and its efficacy is even)&quot;. What does that mean after we have introduced the theory?

45
00:03:21,613 --&gt; 00:03:24,093
It refers to the property and flavour of the drug,

46
00:03:24,326 --&gt; 00:03:28,775
which is categorized into &quot;four kinds of properties and five kinds of flavours&quot; in TCM.

47
00:03:29,053 --&gt; 00:03:31,487
What are the four kinds of properties?

48
00:03:31,720 --&gt; 00:03:36,451
They are referring to the warm, heating, cold and cool properties of drug.

49
00:03:36,683 --&gt; 00:03:43,530
You might think that warm, heating, cold and cool, all these words are used often to describe weather.

50
00:03:43,763 --&gt; 00:03:47,507
Does TCM has a distinction of being &quot;cold and heating&quot; just like weather?

51
00:03:47,741 --&gt; 00:03:52,655
Of course not. &quot;Warm, heating, cold and cool&quot; here refers not to the temperature of drug itself,

52
00:03:52,889 --&gt; 00:03:57,429
but rather drug's effects on human body's metabolism

53
00:03:57,664 --&gt; 00:04:00,663
and temperature change.

54
00:04:01,314 --&gt; 00:04:05,853
As early as in the Western Han Dynasty about 2000 years ago,

55
00:04:06,090 --&gt; 00:04:11,007
people had realized drugs' different effects on human body's temperature changes.

56
00:04:11,236 --&gt; 00:04:15,587
As in the &quot;Book of Han Dynasty: Art and Literature&quot;, 

57
00:04:15,868 --&gt; 00:04:20,594
it said, &quot;classical prescriptions, which are warm or cool temperature of the herbs, can be used to measure the severity of sickness,

58
00:04:20,829 --&gt; 00:04:24,713
through the properties and flavours of drugs.&quot;

59
00:04:24,949 --&gt; 00:04:29,861
This implies that drugs have the properties of being warm and cool.

60
00:04:30,095 --&gt; 00:04:36,975
Does that mean we can judge the drug properties by our own bodies?

61
00:04:37,257 --&gt; 00:04:40,159
This is a rough understanding.

62
00:04:40,439 --&gt; 00:04:44,743
More accurately speaking, drug properties are observed and summarized according to 

63
00:04:45,070 --&gt; 00:04:49,097
human bodies' reactions and responses after taking the drugs. 

64
00:04:49,379 --&gt; 00:04:52,466
For example a man who has a cold. 

65
00:04:52,842 --&gt; 00:04:59,205
Visual symptoms include fever with aversion to cold, and that aversion to cold means serious fear of cold.

66
00:04:59,485 --&gt; 00:05:02,388
Even if you warm him or her by a fire or cover that person with thick quilt, he/she will still feel cold.

67
00:05:02,673 --&gt; 00:05:09,597
Symptoms may also include nasal discharge and slightly yellow urine. 

68
00:05:09,876 --&gt; 00:05:13,621
The patient's nasal discharge is clear and transparent.

69
00:05:13,859 --&gt; 00:05:16,569
and coating on the tongue is white. All these are symptoms caused by cold factors.

70
00:05:16,849 --&gt; 00:05:22,559
If, at this time, you use decoction of perilla frutescens or ginger for the treatment,

71
00:05:22,840 --&gt; 00:05:26,536
the patient shall be eased or recovered after diaphoresis.

72
00:05:26,771 --&gt; 00:05:31,081
Accordingly, we can say perilla frutescens and ginger both possess the warm drug property.

73
00:05:31,357 --&gt; 00:05:34,867
Likewise, when a patient shows symptoms of furunculosis, local swelling,

74
00:05:35,102 --&gt; 00:05:38,802
or even yellow urine and yellow coating on the tongue, which are all symptoms caused by heating factors

75
00:05:39,082 --&gt; 00:05:42,636
you can use honeysuckle and chrysanthemum for effective treatment.

76
00:05:42,870 --&gt; 00:05:46,427
This illustrates honeysuckle and chrysanthemum's cool drug property.

77
00:05:46,707 --&gt; 00:05:50,313
Eating ginger often makes people feel &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;heating&quot;,

78
00:05:50,549 --&gt; 00:05:51,995
and you might share that feeling.

79
00:05:52,234 --&gt; 00:05:55,976
But eating chrysanthemum won't let you feel any sense of &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;. 

80
00:05:56,256 --&gt; 00:06:00,981
That is why the &quot;four kinds of properties&quot; could not be judged merely based on our own feelings,

81
00:06:01,264 --&gt; 00:06:07,722
and they have to be summarized according to the drugs' clinical symptoms and efficacy.

82
00:06:07,959 --&gt; 00:06:14,040
Another question is why drug properties can be called &quot;the four kinds of flavours&quot;.

83
00:06:14,322 --&gt; 00:06:19,750
That is only a habit of ancient Chinese, so we just follow the tradition.

84
00:06:19,986 --&gt; 00:06:22,603
Li Shizhen has a famous saying that,

85
00:06:22,884 --&gt; 00:06:27,143
&quot;Mr. Kou said that &quot;warm, heating, cool and cold are properties, while fragrant, smelly, stinking and foul are flavours.

86
00:06:27,376 --&gt; 00:06:29,811
This accords with the descriptions in ”The Book of Rites“.

87
00:06:30,047 --&gt; 00:06:35,379
Indeed, this saying accords with the descriptions in ”The Book of Rites“.

88
00:06:35,614 --&gt; 00:06:37,533
However, since &quot;Huangdi Neijing (The Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor)&quot;,

89
00:06:37,815 --&gt; 00:06:43,012
TCM experts and theorists often spoke of only the flavours,

90
00:06:43,241 --&gt; 00:06:48,906
while the four kinds of properties are neglected. That had formed a habit.

91
00:06:49,145 --&gt; 00:06:52,977
Afterwards people just followed that tradition even though it is not very accurate.

92
00:06:53,210 --&gt; 00:07:05,895
So that's how matters stand. Then how should we understand the relationship between the four drug properties of &quot;warm, heating, cold and cool&quot;.

93
00:07:06,175 --&gt; 00:07:14,551
Generally speaking, &quot;warm and heating&quot; stands for &quot;Yang&quot; while &quot;cool and cold&quot; for &quot;Yin&quot;. They are contradictory.

94
00:07:14,787 --&gt; 00:07:17,500
So they have quite adverse usage.

95
00:07:17,735 --&gt; 00:07:23,678
&quot;Warm and heating&quot; drugs, with the thermogenous properties to fend off the cold

96
00:07:23,961 --&gt; 00:07:29,623
and warming and activating meridian, are usually used for the treatment of cold-related diseases.

97
00:07:29,902 --&gt; 00:07:36,360
On the contrary, &quot;cold and cool&quot; drugs, with the efficacy of heat-clearing and fire-purging,

98
00:07:36,643 --&gt; 00:07:38,564
are often used for the treatment of heat-related diseases.

99
00:07:38,842 --&gt; 00:07:41,793
So what's the difference between &quot;warm&quot; and heating&quot;,  &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;cool&quot;?

100
00:07:42,070 --&gt; 00:07:47,827
&quot;warm&quot; and heating&quot; just differ in degree.

101
00:07:48,110 --&gt; 00:07:51,947
Likewise,  &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; have similar properties and only slight difference of degree.

102
00:07:52,231 --&gt; 00:07:55,502
Will such a classification be oversimplified for so many Chinese medicine?

103
00:07:55,783 --&gt; 00:07:59,201
Indeed, and ancient Chinese had been aware of such problems.

104
00:07:59,433 --&gt; 00:08:02,948
So in order to better represent the differentiated properties,

105
00:08:03,224 --&gt; 00:08:07,810
they add some qualifiers on the basis of the four drug properties of &quot;warm, heating, cold and cool&quot;,

106
00:08:08,092 --&gt; 00:08:11,651
such as &quot;large, small, slight&quot; and so on.

107
00:08:11,857 --&gt; 00:08:14,937
Nonetheless, the strategy of qualifiers remained at qualitative analysis,

108
00:08:15,219 --&gt; 00:08:18,589
instead of quantitative analysis. So such a strategy still has many limitations.

109
00:08:18,868 --&gt; 00:08:21,678
Do there exist any Chinese medicine that is neither warm and heating, nor is cold and cool?

110
00:08:21,956 --&gt; 00:08:27,948
Ginseng, which we have mentioned in the very beginning of the class, serves as good example.

111
00:08:28,228 --&gt; 00:08:30,571
That is why we use &quot;ping (even or flat)&quot; to describe it.

112
00:08:30,850 --&gt; 00:08:36,511
Ginseng has a weaker deviation (towards warm or cool), so that it might be more securely used.

113
00:08:36,794 --&gt; 00:08:44,093
You have mentioned that there is another principle called &quot;five kinds of flavours&quot;in addition to &quot;four kinds of properties&quot; in terms of the theory of property and flavour of TCM.

114
00:08:44,424 --&gt; 00:08:48,960
Yes, as early as in the Zhou Dynasty about 3000 years ago,

115
00:08:49,292 --&gt; 00:08:54,301
people had realized that some drugs' efficacy are connected with their flavours.

116
00:08:54,577 --&gt; 00:08:56,682
In &quot;Zhouli: Tianguan (Rite System of Zhou Dynasty: Court Officials)&quot;,  

117
00:08:56,919 --&gt; 00:09:02,535
&quot;As for flavour, sour drugs are for treatment of bone, spicy for tendon, salty for pulse,

118
00:09:02,766 --&gt; 00:09:06,657
bitter for energy, sweet for flesh, smooth for joint.&quot;

119
00:09:06,885 --&gt; 00:09:10,911
In the later Spring and Autumn Period and Warring-States Period, with the popularity of thoughts of Yin and Yang and Wuxing (five elements),

120
00:09:11,146 --&gt; 00:09:17,887
the theory of flavour had been gradually reformed.

121
00:09:14,451 --&gt; 00:09:18,054
Till the emergence of &quot;Huangdi Neijing (The Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor)&quot;, there had formed rather systematic theory of five kinds of flavours.

122
00:09:19,088 --&gt; 00:09:24,795
Such a theory held that five kinds of flavours, colours and stink accord with the the five internal organs.

123
00:09:25,075 --&gt; 00:09:29,897
For example, we would say that sour drugs are for treatment of liver,

124
00:09:30,177 --&gt; 00:09:32,422
and bitter drugs for treatment of heart.

125
00:09:32,705 --&gt; 00:09:35,278
The five kinds of flavors also accord with the concept of &quot;Yin and Yang&quot;.

126
00:09:35,558 --&gt; 00:09:37,247
Like when it comes to the five kinds of flavors, we would say,

127
00:09:37,478 --&gt; 00:09:42,863
&quot;Spicy, sweet and flat&quot; belong to Yang; and &quot;sour, bitter, salty&quot; belong to Yin.

128
00:09:43,141 --&gt; 00:09:46,511
Later on, there arose the principle of &quot;Five Contraindications&quot;, and what does that mean?

129
