﻿1
00:00:00,191 --&gt; 00:00:05,964
Hello everyone, last time we talked about the concepts and evolution of the five elements.

2
00:00:05,964 --&gt; 00:00:10,377
This time, we will focus on the basic content of the five elements.

3
00:00:10,639 --&gt; 00:00:12,435
It will be introduced in two aspects.

4
00:00:12,619 --&gt; 00:00:18,468
The first aspect is to talk about five elements' attribute relationship among things and phenomena.

5
00:00:18,657 --&gt; 00:00:23,068
The second aspect is to talk about the interpromotion and interrestraint of the five elements.

6
00:00:23,711 --&gt; 00:00:30,218
At first, let's have a look at the relationship diagrams between the five elements which we showed you at the end of last lesson

7
00:00:31,184 --&gt; 00:00:37,322
and see how do things and phenomena have connections by the properties of the five elements.

8
00:00:37,552 --&gt; 00:00:41,146
We will illustrate this diagram from three levels.

9
00:00:44,276 --&gt; 00:00:47,620
First, we will have a look at

10
00:00:47,620 --&gt; 00:00:57,630
the connections between the law of seasons, directions, climate, life, colors, taste, timbre and the attribute of five elements.

11
00:00:57,907 --&gt; 00:01:02,120
For instance, spring is the season when all things break out and germinate.

12
00:01:02,248 --&gt; 00:01:06,706
And it has a character of ascending and free development, which coincide with &quot;wood&quot; in the five elements.

13
00:01:07,968 --&gt; 00:01:11,276
Both the sun and the moon are rising in the east.

14
00:01:11,403 --&gt; 00:01:14,991
And the wind has unsteady shape.

15
00:01:14,991 --&gt; 00:01:17,648
It's able to stoop or stand erect which coincide to the character of &quot;wood&quot;.

16
00:01:17,648 --&gt; 00:01:22,433
These, all these can be classified as &quot;wood&quot; in the five elements.

17
00:01:22,938 --&gt; 00:01:26,502
Similarly, climate in south China is relatively hotter.

18
00:01:26,502 --&gt; 00:01:31,648
Summer is the season of intense heat and the paddy is of the strongest growth.

19
00:01:31,681 --&gt; 00:01:36,292
And these all coincide with the red &quot;fire&quot; in the five elements.

20
00:01:36,875 --&gt; 00:01:42,091
Then you can study and comprehend the rest content in the same manner.

21
00:01:42,368 --&gt; 00:01:47,797
Then, the second level, we will have a look at the components of the function of human body.

22
00:01:48,210 --&gt; 00:01:55,024
And the l inks between emotional activity, main pulse condition and body fluid and the five elements.

23
00:01:56,090 --&gt; 00:01:58,028
Take human body's visceral organs as an example.

24
00:01:58,681 --&gt; 00:02:04,186
Liver belongs to &quot;wood&quot;. Liver and gallbladder are a pair of Zang-Fu viscera.

25
00:02:04,462 --&gt; 00:02:07,215
And there are close connections between these two organs.

26
00:02:07,483 --&gt; 00:02:16,638
In the meantime, liver governs tendons, which opens at the eyes. Therefore, gallbladder, tendons and eyes all belong to &quot;wood&quot;.

27
00:02:16,872 --&gt; 00:02:21,183
So traditional Chinese medicine regards the main function of &quot;liver&quot; as to dredge the qi movement of the whole body.

28
00:02:21,351 --&gt; 00:02:28,228
Hence, it can regulate human being's emotional activity and promote digestion, blood operation and water metabolism.

29
00:02:28,602 --&gt; 00:02:33,436
Liver-qi governs ascend, and is interior-exteriorly related with gallbladder. So liver and gallbladder are all belong to the &quot;wood&quot;.

30
00:02:33,624 --&gt; 00:02:39,960
Similarly, the earth's core belongs to the &quot;fire&quot;, and heart is interior-exteriorly related with the small intestine. These two are closely lined.

31
00:02:39,960 --&gt; 00:02:44,223
Then, heart governs pulse and opens at the tongue.

32
00:02:44,223 --&gt; 00:02:49,200
Therefore, small intestine, pulse and tongue all fall into the &quot;fire&quot;.

33
00:02:49,864 --&gt; 00:02:53,666
Spleen pertains the earth, while it is interior-exteriorly related with the stomach.

34
00:02:54,699 --&gt; 00:03:02,764
Spleen governs flesh and opens at the mouth. Therefore, stomach, flesh and mouth all belong to the &quot;earth&quot;.

35
00:03:03,740 --&gt; 00:03:07,130
Lung pertains to the metal, while it is interior-exteriorly related with the large intestine.

36
00:03:07,397 --&gt; 00:03:15,344
Meanwhile, lung the lung is in charge of the hair and skin, and nose is orifice to Lung, Therefore, large intestine, skin and nose all belong to the &quot;metal&quot;.

37
00:03:15,936 --&gt; 00:03:19,197
Kidney belongs to the &quot;water&quot;, and bladder is interior-exteriorly related to kidney.

38
00:03:19,519 --&gt; 00:03:29,656
Kidney is in charge of bone, and opens at ears, the genitals and anus. So, bladder, bones, ears, the genitals and anus all pertain to the &quot;water&quot;.

39
00:03:29,918 --&gt; 00:03:33,712
These all indirect derivations.

40
00:03:34,490 --&gt; 00:03:37,019
Then from the perspective of the third level is,

41
00:03:37,019 --&gt; 00:03:44,030
the seasons, directions, climate, law of life activities, colours, flavours and timbres

42
00:03:44,780 --&gt; 00:03:53,441
are closely linked to the components of functions of human body, emotional activities, main pulse condition and body fluid by the attributes of the five elements.

43
00:03:53,721 --&gt; 00:03:55,130
Then, for instance,

44
00:03:55,363 --&gt; 00:04:00,296
climate in North China is cold, especially in winter.

45
00:04:00,619 --&gt; 00:04:05,438
Landscape all covers by snow, and everything is hidden from the outside world, which presents the character of the &quot;water&quot;.

46
00:04:05,711 --&gt; 00:04:10,130
Correspondingly, kidney, bladder, deep pulse in pulse condition

47
00:04:10,408 --&gt; 00:04:14,468
and fear in emotional activities all have such kind of character.

48
00:04:14,468 --&gt; 00:04:24,011
Therefore, human's these organs, emotional activities and physiological phenomena together with winter, coldness and black colour are closely linked.

49
00:04:25,133 --&gt; 00:04:32,828
Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine thinks that eating black sesame and black soya beans will do good to the maintenance of kidney.

50
00:04:33,262 --&gt; 00:04:41,489
And fear will do bad to kidney. Accordingly, avoiding too much &quot;fear&quot; can protect kidney.

51
00:04:42,471 --&gt; 00:04:44,828
In the system of the five elements,

52
00:04:45,885 --&gt; 00:04:48,265
A book called Plain Questions: Yin and Yang Theory has mentioned that

53
00:04:48,483 --&gt; 00:04:53,955
the wind derives from the east, the wood from the wind, the acid from the wood, the liver from the acid and the tendon from the liver.

54
00:04:54,795 --&gt; 00:05:02,670
when in heaven, it is wind; when in the land, it is wood; when in the body, it is tendon; when in viscera, it is liver; when in colours, it is dark; when in timbres, it is skin.

55
00:05:02,670 --&gt; 00:05:10,345
when in voice, it is yelling; when in changes, it is grasping; when in orifice, it is eye; when in flavour, it is acid; when in emotion, it is anger.

56
00:05:11,046 --&gt; 00:05:16,805
In the original text, the &quot;birth&quot; to wind and the wood, here birth means inner connections.

57
00:05:17,275 --&gt; 00:05:21,851
Just like that, theory of the five elements classify everything into five types.

58
00:05:22,550 --&gt; 00:05:26,949
Things of each type have certain connections.

59
00:05:27,366 --&gt; 00:05:32,196
Therefore, theory of the five elements prove the unity of human being and natural environment.

60
00:05:32,702 --&gt; 00:05:35,001
OK, let's shift to the second topic now.

61
00:05:35,199 --&gt; 00:05:38,155
The second topic is the interpromotion and interrestraint of the five elements

62
00:05:38,860 --&gt; 00:05:43,556
Theory of the five elements not only discusses the attributes and characteristics of things,

63
00:05:44,200 --&gt; 00:05:46,572
which simply classifies them into five types,

64
00:05:46,772 --&gt; 00:05:56,083
more importantly is to explain the inner relations of each things in the complicated system by the mutual promotion and restraint between the five elements.

65
00:05:56,366 --&gt; 00:06:02,488
And mechanism of unity, completeness and self-control presented based on these connections.

66
00:06:04,015 --&gt; 00:06:07,893
Then,what does the mutual promotion and restraint between the five elements mean?

67
00:06:09,101 --&gt; 00:06:13,088
It means that among different things, two basic relations exist.

68
00:06:13,272 --&gt; 00:06:18,084
In the five elements, these two basic relations are illustrated as mutual promotion and restraint.

69
00:06:18,358 --&gt; 00:06:25,276
So-called mutual promotion means one thing can be promoted, encouraged and bred by things of other types.

70
00:06:25,502 --&gt; 00:06:30,410
To be simple, it means one thing has positive impact upon the other thing.

71
00:06:30,727 --&gt; 00:06:35,040
Ancient thinkers found that there is a common phenomenon in the nature world in practice.

72
00:06:35,219 --&gt; 00:06:41,769
One thing always appeared after the emergence of the other. And it would be influenced by the other.

73
00:06:42,180 --&gt; 00:06:47,248
Therefore, combined the knowledge of the five elements, they summarized and had the theory of the mutual promotion of the five elements.

74
00:06:47,715 --&gt; 00:06:50,218
The book Chunqiu Leaming- Theory of the Five Elements reads that

75
00:06:50,398 --&gt; 00:06:58,819
There are five elements in the world-wood, fire, earth, metal and water. Wood breeds fire; fire breeds earth; earth breeds metal; metal breed water.

76
00:06:59,601 --&gt; 00:07:05,004
Water is winter, metal autumn, earth late summer, fire summer and wood spring.

77
00:07:05,329 --&gt; 00:07:12,625
Spring governs germination; summer governs growth; late summer governs recuperation; autumn governs harvest and winter governs storage.

78
00:07:13,319 --&gt; 00:07:16,759
Four seasons-spring, summer, late summer, autumn and winter,

79
00:07:16,759 --&gt; 00:07:24,466
and germination, growth, recuperation, harvest, storage during a year all present the mutual promotion relation of the five elements.

80
00:07:25,115 --&gt; 00:07:29,058
Therefore,the Inner Canon of Huangdi emphasizes that the five elements should have orders and four seasons have their own timing.

81
00:07:29,559 --&gt; 00:07:32,388
There exits similar phenomena like this in life activities,

82
00:07:32,718 --&gt; 00:07:36,383
which belong to normal phenomena of nature or life activities.

83
00:07:36,657 --&gt; 00:07:40,013
Depending on this positive promotion,

84
00:07:40,013 --&gt; 00:07:46,251
nature can have luxuriant view and life activities can be full of vigor.

85
00:07:47,093 --&gt; 00:07:50,383
So what is the rule and order of the mutual promotion of the five elements?

86
00:07:50,625 --&gt; 00:07:57,574
Wood breeds fire, followed by fire breeding earth, earth breeding metal, metal breeding water and water breeding wood again.

87
00:07:57,574 --&gt; 00:07:59,708
Therefore, a cycle system is formed.

88
00:07:59,932 --&gt; 00:08:01,409
Then, mutual restraint

89
00:08:01,727 --&gt; 00:08:04,888
mutual restraint is called mutual resistance.

90
00:08:04,888 --&gt; 00:08:10,355
It means one kind of things can restrain and control the other kind of things.

91
00:08:10,675 --&gt; 00:08:15,502
In short, one thing can have negative impact upon the other thing.

92
00:08:15,916 --&gt; 00:08:19,762
Ancient thinkers found the mutual promotion of nature world, in the meantime,

93
00:08:20,001 --&gt; 00:08:24,817
they realized there existed a common phenomenon of the contrast attribute.

94
00:08:25,095 --&gt; 00:08:28,760
That is, one thing always would be hold back by others.

95
00:08:29,135 --&gt; 00:08:33,944
Therefore, they concluded this common phenomenon into the mutual restraint theory of the five elements.

96
00:08:34,915 --&gt; 00:08:37,839
In Plain Questions, Lie Ru pointed out that

97
00:08:38,158 --&gt; 00:08:49,883
if metal is added to wood, it would descend; if water is added to fire, it would extinguish; if wood is added to earth, it would lost its power; when fire is added to metal, it would decrease; if earth is added to water, it would die out. All these happen to everything in nature. 

98
00:08:50,300 --&gt; 00:08:54,410
This all belongs to the common phenomenon in nature and life activities.

99
00:08:54,681 --&gt; 00:08:56,888
So he said it was common in everything.

100
00:08:57,348 --&gt; 00:09:00,675
Thanks to this kind of restraint,

101
00:09:01,037 --&gt; 00:09:06,949
nature and life activities can be full of vigour in normal situations,

102
00:09:06,949 --&gt; 00:09:10,716
and won't be over-stimulation which will be harmful.

103
00:09:10,898 --&gt; 00:09:15,653
So what is the rule and order of the mutual restraint of the five elements?

104
00:09:15,969 --&gt; 00:09:22,477
That is, wood restricts earth; earth restricts water; water restricts fire; fire restricts metal and metal restricts wood.

105
00:09:23,042 --&gt; 00:09:28,921
The ancients once summarized the order of mutual restraint in the five elements as &quot;Elements next to each other are mutual promoted, while every other position, elements are of mutual restraint.

106
00:09:29,142 --&gt; 00:09:31,307
We can see in the diagram of the five elements.

10
00:09:31,535 --&gt; 00:09:37,847
So-called &quot;bi&quot; means in close proximity, which indicates the order of wood, fire, earth, metal and water is mutual promoted.

108
00:09:38,028 --&gt; 00:09:45,091
So-called &quot;jian&quot; means that in the order of mutual promotion, every one position, the elements are restricted.

109
00:09:46,099 --&gt; 00:09:50,588
So how to comprehend the mutual relations of mutual restraint in the five elements?

110
00:09:50,817 --&gt; 00:09:55,551
The theory of the Five Elements holds the view that mutual promotion and mutual restraint among things are not one and the only one,

111
00:09:55,551 --&gt; 00:09:57,175
but have close connections.

112
00:09:57,597 --&gt; 00:10:01,268
It presents in the generation within restriction.

113
00:10:01,485 --&gt; 00:10:05,439
Only like this can nature world maintains its ecological balance

114
00:10:05,758 --&gt; 00:10:08,535
and human body maintains its physiological stability.

115
00:10:08,947 --&gt; 00:10:11,350
Therefore, Diagrams of Classified Canon mentions that

116
00:10:11,350 --&gt; 00:10:19,239
The function of thing cannot exist without promotion and restriction. Without promotion, there wouldn't be any development. Without restriction, over-stimulation would be harmful.

117
00:10:21,239 --&gt; 00:10:24,156
Then, we will look at the over-restriction and reverse restriction of the five elements.

118
00:10:24,480 --&gt; 00:10:27,595
What does the over-restriction and reverse restriction of the five elements mean?

119
00:10:27,779 --&gt; 00:10:31,089
It mainly means abnormal mutual restrictions.

120
00:10:31,885 --&gt; 00:10:34,435
Over-restriction means the excessive mutual restriction of the five elements.

121
00:10:35,136 --&gt; 00:10:39,388
Under normal circumstances, one element in the five elements can restrict the other element.

122
00:10:39,388 --&gt; 00:10:43,006
But this kind of restriction has a certain limit.

123
00:10:43,006 --&gt; 00:10:47,875
Beyond a certain limit, one element would have excessive restriction to the other element.

124
00:10:48,158 --&gt; 00:10:51,344
And this will lead to a series of abnormal reactions, which are called over-restriction.

125
00:10:52,129 --&gt; 00:10:56,331
Restriction itself has a meaning of oppressing the weak side.

126
00:10:57,144 --&gt; 00:11:00,413
Reverse restriction means if the five elements are restricted in a reverse way, it will be harmful.

127
00:11:00,729 --&gt; 00:11:02,885
It indicates an abnormal situation of mutual restraint.

128
00:11:02,885 --&gt; 00:11:09,470
Normally, one element is restricted and control by other element.

129
00:11:10,253 --&gt; 00:11:15,013
Such as wood is restricted by metal, while earth is restricted by wood.

130
00:11:15,253 --&gt; 00:11:20,491
However, when power of the five elements becomes abnormal,

131
00:11:20,769 --&gt; 00:11:22,853
sometimes the opposite situation would happen.

132
00:11:23,135 --&gt; 00:11:27,223
Wood is no longer restricted by metal, but restricts metal on the contrary.

133
00:11:27,500 --&gt; 00:11:31,374
Earth is no longer restricted by wood, but restricts wood on the contrary.

134
00:11:31,556 --&gt; 00:11:35,669
Abnormal mutual restrictions like these are called reverse restriction or restriction in the opposite direction.

135
00:11:36,270 --&gt; 00:11:40,717
Therefore, over-restriction and reverse restriction all belong to abnormal mutual restrictions in the five elements.

136
00:11:40,989 --&gt; 00:11:44,076
The function of both is in opposite directions.

137
00:11:44,448 --&gt; 00:11:47,175
Over-restriction is restricted excessively according to the order of mutual restriction,

138
00:11:47,339 --&gt; 00:11:50,523
while reverse restriction is abnormal restriction contrast to the order of mutual restriction.

139
00:11:50,706 --&gt; 00:11:54,877
In the process of life activities, both over-restriction and reverse restriction belong to pathology.

140
00:11:55,531 --&gt; 00:12:01,258
Then there are two kinds of reasons for the abnormal mutual restriction of the five elements which leads to over-
restriction and reverse restriction.

141
00:12:01,573 --&gt; 00:12:08,520
One is the excessive flourishing of one element which leads to the over restriction to the element restricted by it,

142
00:12:08,935 --&gt; 00:12:14,079
which directly causes its weakness so that the promotion and restriction become abnormal.

143
00:12:14,079 --&gt; 00:12:22,710
For instance, if wood is too vigorous, it will have excessive restriction to earth. Then it will cause the deficiency of earth. This is called the over-restriction of wood to earth.

144
00:12:23,045 --&gt; 00:12:28,239
Then, another one is wood is too vigorous, although it should be restricted by metal,

145
00:12:28,239 --&gt; 00:12:35,104
metal not only lack the power to restrict wood, but is restricted by wood.

146
00:12:35,329 --&gt; 00:12:37,114
This called reverse restriction of wood to metal.

147
00:12:38,239 --&gt; 00:12:43,535
These situations presented in the process of life activities are the positivist pathological change of over-stimulated function. 

148
00:12:44,149 --&gt; 00:12:52,164
Another situation is that one element itself is too weak, which can also leads to over-restriction and reverse restriction.

149
00:12:52,164 --&gt; 00:12:59,385
Because of the weakliness of one element, it has little power to restrict the other element,

150
00:12:59,614 --&gt; 00:13:02,737
which means it is easily restricted by the other element.

151
00:13:02,965 --&gt; 00:13:10,616
For example, lack of metal always leads to wood is so powerful that metal is restricted by it. This is called deficiency of metal and over restriction of wood.

152
00:13:10,893 --&gt; 00:13:17,552
On the other part, if one element is weak, it is easily be over-restricted by the element that controls it.

153
00:13:17,552 --&gt; 00:13:25,149
Like the deficiency of earth would easily result in the over restricted by wood. It is also called deficiency of earth and reverse restriction of wood.

154
00:13:25,149 --&gt; 00:13:32,800
These situations would manifest as a kind of pathological change-syndrome of deficiency presented as insufficiency.

155
00:13:33,399 --&gt; 00:13:37,252
Both over-restriction and reverse restriction are abnormal mutual restrictions.

156
00:13:37,620 --&gt; 00:13:40,324
There are differences and connections between these two.

157
00:13:40,324 --&gt; 00:13:44,699
Differences lie in that over restriction is excessive restricted according to the order of the five elements.

158
00:13:44,923 --&gt; 00:13:48,899
While reverse restriction is abnormal restriction in reverse order of the five elements.

159
00:13:49,306 --&gt; 00:13:53,965
Their connections lie in that when over restriction happens, sometimes reverse restriction appears, too.

160
00:13:53,965 --&gt; 00:13:57,281
While reverse restriction happens, sometimes over restriction appears.

161
00:13:57,478 --&gt; 00:14:02,481
For example, if wood is powerful enough, it can not only over restricted earth, but reverse restricts metal.

162
00:14:02,763 --&gt; 00:14:08,804
When deficiency of metal happens, it would not only be reverse restricted by wood, but over restricts by fire.

163
00:14:09,172 --&gt; 00:14:12,480
Over restriction and reverse restriction always happen together.

164
00:14:12,750 --&gt; 00:14:16,735
Therefore, in Plain Questions- Five Operations, there reads that,

165
00:14:17,429 --&gt; 00:14:22,181
if qi is excessive, it would over restrict one element and reverse restrict the other element.

166
00:14:22,412 --&gt; 00:14:26,805
if qi is not enough, it would fail to restrict one element and be over restricted by others.

167
00:14:26,979 --&gt; 00:14:29,884
if it is excessive, it would easily restrict other elements.

168
00:14:30,110 --&gt; 00:14:34,121
In a word, we can see the rule of mutual restriction of the five elements from this diagram

169
00:14:35,101 --&gt; 00:14:37,823
Water, fire, earth, metal and water are mutually promoted in a circle in order.

170
00:14:38,607 --&gt; 00:14:42,085
Water, earth, water, fire and metal are mutually restricted in a circle in order.

171
00:14:42,085 --&gt; 00:14:47,190
So, these five elements both have mutual promotion and mutual restriction.

172
00:14:47,352 --&gt; 00:14:50,038
Then, a relatively stable system is formed.

173
00:14:50,878 --&gt; 00:14:56,421
Our course about the theory of the five elements is over now.

174
00:14:56,799 --&gt; 00:15:01,851
Next course, we will talk about the thought of the five elements in traditional Chinese medicine.
