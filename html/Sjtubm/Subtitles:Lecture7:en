00:00:00,243 --&gt; 00:00:06,461
Hello everyone, last time we have learnt renewal part of this course.

2
00:00:06,795 --&gt; 00:00:11,797
This course we will start to learn the second chapter, Approaching traditional Chinese medicine.

3
00:00:11,851 --&gt; 00:00:16,500
The main aim of this chapter is to help us have a elementary knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine.

4
00:00:16,663 --&gt; 00:00:20,705
First show to everyone that criticism of Chinese medicine, 

5
00:00:20,850 --&gt; 00:00:22,606
supported by a number of different perspectives

6
00:00:22,799 --&gt; 00:00:26,794
and then have a look at the development of traditional Chinese medicine in the long river of history.

7
00:00:26,866 --&gt; 00:00:31,540
At last we will introduce the core theories and knowledge pattern of traditional Chinese medicine

8
00:00:31,730 --&gt; 00:00:35,502
so that learners can have a complete knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine.

9
00:00:35,780 --&gt; 00:00:39,406
We divide the second chapter into six parts,  

10
00:00:39,671 --&gt; 00:00:41,770
including the rights and wrongs of traditional Chinese medicine,

11
00:00:41,793 --&gt; 00:00:45,489
the general discussion of yin-yang theory,

12
00:00:45,689 --&gt; 00:00:48,995
the enquiry of Five-elements theory, theory of zangfu organs and meridians,

13
00:00:49,000 --&gt; 00:00:49,960
the analysis of property of medicine.

14
00:00:49,960 --&gt; 00:00:53,551
First, we will talk about the rights and wrongs of traditional Chinese medicine.

15
00:00:53,880 --&gt; 00:00:55,103
It includes four topics.

16
00:00:55,508 --&gt; 00:01:01,228
This time, we will talk about how does acupuncture gain popularity among the world.

17
00:01:01,294 --&gt; 00:01:05,361
At present, if you can find a acupuncturist to have acupuncture,

18
00:01:05,669 --&gt; 00:01:08,056
it won't be hard for you to keep healthy.

19
00:01:08,816 --&gt; 00:01:10,078
Fifty years ago,

20
00:01:10,232 --&gt; 00:01:14,000
even in big citied in America or Europe

21
00:01:14,100 --&gt; 00:01:15,600
it was very difficult to find a acupuncturist, 
 
22
00:01:16,054 --&gt; 00:01:20,564
So why are there so huge a difference in just 50 years?

23
00:01:20,965 --&gt; 00:01:24,566
During this course, we will mainly discuss about how acupuncuture is so poplular all over the world.

24
00:01:24,756 --&gt; 00:01:27,395
Now, I show you a picture.

25
00:01:27,592 --&gt; 00:01:28,746
Do you know who he is?

26
00:01:30,676 --&gt; 00:01:34,000
He is the founder of PRC - Mao Zedong.

27
00:01:34,285 --&gt; 00:01:38,995
Let's start with the prophet of Chairman Mao in the beginning of 1950s.

28
00:01:39,000 --&gt; 00:01:40,073
He once said

29
00:01:40,434 --&gt; 00:01:42,988
traditional Chinese medicine is a treasure

30
00:01:43,000 --&gt; 00:01:45,346
rather than an outdated thing 

31
00:01:45,624 --&gt; 00:01:48,000
and it would be used by people around the world.

32
00:01:48,459 --&gt; 00:01:50,398
So does his prophet come true?

33
00:01:51,787 --&gt; 00:01:55,269
Yes, we can see that his prophet has realized.

34
00:01:55,349 --&gt; 00:01:59,248
Presently, more than 130 countries in the world are using traditional Chinese medicine as a  medical treatment.

35
00:01:59,512 --&gt; 00:02:03,727
Over 140 countries and regions are using acupuncture to keep fit.

36
00:02:04,184 --&gt; 00:02:08,657
And it has gained legal position in many countries.

37
00:02:08,918 --&gt; 00:02:12,846
So, why would this prophet come true in just a few decades?

38
00:02:12,999 --&gt; 00:02:17,452
On the one hand, acupuncture is indeed the particular treatment of traditional Chinese medicine 

39
00:02:17,515 --&gt; 00:02:21,879
with obvious curative effect,few side effect and has a great value of promotion.

40
00:02:23,103 --&gt; 00:02:27,333
On the other hand, Mao Zedong received traditional Chinese medicine 

41
00:02:27,673 --&gt; 00:02:29,738
Aware of the efficacy of Chinese medicine

42
00:02:30,712 --&gt; 00:02:32,065
In the meantime, we cannot deny that 

43
00:02:32,308 --&gt; 00:02:37,440
some people and events have played a great role 

44
00:02:37,851 --&gt; 00:02:39,117
in promoting acupuncture into the international community.

45
00:02:39,892 --&gt; 00:02:41,000
The first one worthed to be mentioned was James Rist, 

46
00:02:41,010 --&gt; 00:02:44,377
a New York Times columnist.

47
00:02:44,461 --&gt; 00:02:47,428
He paid a visit to China in July, 1971. Unfortunately, 

48
00:02:48,073 --&gt; 00:02:52,282
he had appendicitis in Beijing and received appendectomy.

49
00:02:52,925 --&gt; 00:02:54,380
After the operation, he had andominal distention  

50
00:02:54,547 --&gt; 00:02:57,599
and then Chinese doctor gave him a 20-minute acupuncture treatment,

51
00:02:58,018 --&gt; 00:03:02,870
which was a common treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. 

52
00:03:02,999 --&gt; 00:03:06,000
But for James, it was a rare matter.

53
00:03:06,002 --&gt; 00:03:09,000
Therefore, he wrote a press release 

54
00:03:09,144 --&gt; 00:03:12,120
which was pubished in New York Times on 26th, July, 1971.

55
00:03:12,120 --&gt; 00:03:15,999
In this piece of news, he wrote about his personal experience,
 
56
00:03:16,000 --&gt; 00:03:18,000
which not only introduces his operation and acupuncture treatment,

57
00:03:18,462 --&gt; 00:03:22,472
but also mentioned the acupuncture anesthesia study in progress in China.

58
00:03:22,796 --&gt; 00:03:25,628
This aroused the attention of people in western countries.

59
00:03:26,000 --&gt; 00:03:32,000
In his another press release, he mentioned the process of acupuncture anesthesia operation that he and his wife 
 
60
00:03:32,215 --&gt; 00:03:34,272
watched in Shanghai's Huashan hospital.

61
00:03:34,937 --&gt; 00:03:38,000
He knew that he was not a expert in this aspect

62
00:03:38,010 --&gt; 00:03:40,000
In some cases not easy to judge

63
00:03:40,389 --&gt; 00:03:45,000
and he received an interview by CBS radio in which

64
00:03:45,203 --&gt; 00:03:47,018
he mentioned his operation and acupuncture again.

65
00:03:47,391 --&gt; 00:03:51,000
And this can be proved in a piece of paper.

66
00:03:51,267 --&gt; 00:03:53,142
Then, with James'position, 

67
00:03:53,561 --&gt; 00:03:58,941
these reports of course can arouse attention of people in western countries.

68
00:03:58,999 --&gt; 00:04:02,999
But at that time, more they had was curiosity and suspicion.

69
00:04:03,000 --&gt; 00:04:07,000
Then, several months later, president Nixon paid a visit to China.

70
00:04:07,050 --&gt; 00:04:09,250
Some of his accompanying Americans said 

71
00:04:09,250 --&gt; 00:04:14,397
they wanted to prove whether acupuncture was as miraculous as it was reported.

72
00:04:14,910 --&gt; 00:04:17,000
On 24th, Feburary, 1972,
 
73
00:04:17,001 --&gt; 00:04:20,000
general Hacker,presidential assistant

74
00:04:20,019 --&gt; 00:04:23,785
with part of members of American delegation, 

75
00:04:23,900 --&gt; 00:04:25,785
in the third hospital of Peking University Medical Academy

76 
00:04:25,982 --&gt; 00:04:30,237
watched an upper right axillary excision anaesthetized by acupuncture

77
00:04:30,546 --&gt; 00:04:36,165
It is said that the private doctor of Nixon president 

78
00:04:36,486 --&gt; 00:04:38,171
watched this operation, too.

79
00:04:38,725 --&gt; 00:04:43,692
Prefessor Xi Yulin in that hospital mentioned in his memoir:  

80
00:04:43,701 --&gt; 00:04:45,984
Reporter in New York Times once said

81
00:04:46,000 --&gt; 00:04:47,887
he no longer regarded acupuncture anaesthesis as a myth.

82
00:04:49,431 --&gt; 00:04:55,429
This actual inspection of acupuncture anaesthesis dispelled many western people's doubts.

83
00:04:56,263 --&gt; 00:05:00,164
Then, let us briefly look back to the history of acupuncture anaesthesis.

84
00:05:00,412 --&gt; 00:05:06,777
During 656 and 661, when Dee Renjie, a brilliant acupuncturist, entered the pass, .

85
00:05:07,379 --&gt; 00:05:10,005
he met a child at the age of 14 or 15

86
00:05:10,100 --&gt; 00:05:14,900
This child had a tumour at his arm, which was very painful

87
00:05:14,925 --&gt; 00:05:18,535
Dee gave acupuncture to his specific points behind his head 

88
00:05:18,999 --&gt; 00:05:21,940
and his tumour was successfully removed.

89
00:05:21,999 --&gt; 00:05:25,285
This was the first case of acupuncture anaesthesis operation.

90
00:05:25,783 --&gt; 00:05:29,673
On 30th, October, 1958, 

91
00:05:29,673 --&gt; 00:05:33,142
doctor Yin Enzhu in Shanghai First People's Hospital

92
00:05:33,425 --&gt; 00:05:36,993
after the approval of a patient named Shen Jigen,

93
00:05:37,000 --&gt; 00:05:40,854
gave an acupuncture treatment to his heku acupoint between his two hands 

94
00:05:40,981 --&gt; 00:05:43,000
without any anaesthesis.

95
00:05:43,464 --&gt; 00:05:47,357
Then she used operationg apparatus to touch his swollen tonsils, 

96
00:05:47,470 --&gt; 00:05:50,000
and the patient felt no discomfort or pain.

97
00:05:50,470 --&gt; 00:05:55,000
And his tonsils was cut out smoothly. 

98
00:05:55,001 --&gt; 00:06:00,230
In the process of operation, the patient only felt a mild nausea and some few partial hemorrhage,

99
00:06:00,500 --&gt; 00:06:06,002
This event was reported on The Liberation Daily, Shanghai on 5th, September, 1958.

100
00:06:06,318 --&gt; 00:06:11,333
And aroused the popularity of learning traditional Chinese acupuncture all over the country.

101
00:06:11,400 --&gt; 00:06:15,797
Soon, the clinical application of acupuncture anaesthesis developed in a fast pace.

102
00:06:15,806 --&gt; 00:06:17,573
On 18th, July, 1971

103
00:06:18,087 --&gt; 00:06:23,000
People's Daily announced to the whole world of China's acupuncture anaesthesis for the first time.

104
00:06:23,000 --&gt; 00:06:27,128
Over 100 kinds of operation, adding up to 600 thousand cases, 

105
00:06:27,223 --&gt; 00:06:29,230
this all contributed to the successful results.

106
00:06:29,336 --&gt; 00:06:32,687
From acupuncture treatment to acupuncture anaesthesis,
 
107
00:06:32,966 --&gt; 00:06:37,143
it is a historic progress in the history of Chinese acupuncture.

108
00:06:37,511 --&gt; 00:06:43,560
These  innovative products attracted the world's attention. 

109
00:06:43,626 --&gt; 00:06:48,000
After the visit of President Nixon, there appeared China heat in the U.S,
110

00:06:48,002 --&gt; 00:06:51,909
including Chinese food, movies, clothes and books of Mao Zedong.

111
00:06:52,323 --&gt; 00:06:55,511
And traditional Chinese medicine, like acupuncture 

112
00:06:55,896 --&gt; 00:06:57,562
is also on the list.

113
00:06:57,774 --&gt; 00:07:00,163
And when Nixon's delegation to China back to America,

114
00:07:00,163 --&gt; 00:07:03,000
they also leart a human body model of acupuncture acupoints, 
 
115
00:07:03,188 --&gt; 00:07:08,867
which was put on display in Beijing and Shanghai

116
00:07:08,990 --&gt; 00:07:11,987
when marked the 30th anniversary of President Nixon's first visit to China.

117
00:07:12,147 --&gt; 00:07:16,166
And some introduction of China appealed to the outside world, 

118
00:07:16,393 --&gt; 00:07:19,397
especially American's attention to China's acupuncture anaesthesis.

119
00:07:19,466 --&gt; 00:07:22,427
Just as Ollie st. said, 

120
00:07:22,762 --&gt; 00:07:23,926
when Nixon returned to his country,
 
121
00:07:24,292 --&gt; 00:07:30,745
he introduced traditional Chinese acupuncture to American who were fascinated about alternative medicine.

122
00:07:31,196 --&gt; 00:07:36,231
President Nixon's visit to China opened the door of Sino-American communication.

123
00:07:36,791 --&gt; 00:07:38,000
Afterwards, more and more Americans,

124
00:07:38,001 --&gt; 00:07:43,732
even reporters and scholars in the whole western countries had the opportunity to come to China,
 
125
00:07:44,110 --&gt; 00:07:48,000
and further spreaded acupuncture anaesthesis to the world.

126
00:07:48,371 --&gt; 00:07:53,481
In 1973, when American scientists saw a color documentary about an experiment of two rabbits
 
127
00:07:53,481 --&gt; 00:07:58,000
receiving acupuncture in a cross tubular way, 

128
00:07:58,036 --&gt; 00:08:02,629
they sent a medical delegation to China 

129
00:08:02,745 --&gt; 00:08:05,859
to investigate China's acupuncture anaesthesis and its clinical application.

130
00:08:06,089 --&gt; 00:08:10,000
Since then, acupuncture therapy began to 

131
00:08:10,142 --&gt; 00:08:13,667
arouse western mainstream society's attention.

132
00:08:13,995 --&gt; 00:08:14,913
In 1980s,
 
133
00:08:15,280 --&gt; 00:08:18,000
it saw a boom 

134
00:08:18,012 --&gt; 00:08:23,000
for foreigners to come to China to study traditional Chinese medicine.

135
00:08:23,101 --&gt; 00:08:24,193
On the other part,

136
00:08:24,612 --&gt; 00:08:29,198
WHO has found the prospect of acupuncture therapy 

137
00:08:29,575 --&gt; 00:08:33,351
and has begun to popularize it around the world. 

138
00:08:33,770 --&gt; 00:08:36,961
It established International Acupuncture Training Center in 1975   

139
00:08:37,280 --&gt; 00:08:42,571
and released special issue of acupuncture in 1979

140
00:08:42,618 --&gt; 00:08:43,539
to introduce and broadcast acupuncture,

141
00:08:44,192 --&gt; 00:08:46,507
which can be adopted in 43 kinds of diseases.

142
00:08:46,933 --&gt; 00:08:51,691
Later on, WHO organized a series of activities.

143
00:08:51,702 --&gt; 00:08:57,492
And acupuncture began to have legal position in some western countries 

144
00:08:57,905 --&gt; 00:08:59,000
and regions besides WHO.

145
00:08:59,100 --&gt; 00:09:02,891
It was Massachusetts, US that first admitted

146
00:09:02,995 --&gt; 00:09:05,173
the legal position of acupuncture in 1973.

147
00:09:05,324 --&gt; 00:09:10,000
And FDA officially relieved the restriction

148
00:09:10,115 --&gt; 00:09:12,000
on acupuncture in 1990.

149
00:09:12,143 --&gt; 00:09:15,983
Since then, acupuncture not only gained its international recognization

150
00:09:16,350 --&gt; 00:09:21,000
but also drived the regression of traditional medicine and a new wave of research.

151
00:09:21,392 --&gt; 00:09:26,509
WHO listed traditional medicine as its main working content, 

152
00:09:26,966 --&gt; 00:09:31,237
and made some policies upon it.

153
00:09:31,334 --&gt; 00:09:33,185
Additionally, in Australia,

154
00:09:35,058 --&gt; 00:09:38,557
parliament in state of Victoria passed some plans in 2000.

155
00:09:38,683 --&gt; 00:09:44,357
Britain also founded the Management Committee of traditional Chinese medicine in 2004.

156
00:09:45,018 --&gt; 00:09:53,035
All these above-mentioned events present that the western countries have a better understanding of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture.

157
00:09:53,641 --&gt; 00:09:58,308
Therefore, the prophet of Mao Zedong is correct indeed.

158
00:09:58,406 --&gt; 00:10:02,000
So when did traditional Chinese acupuncture appear in western world?

159
00:10:02,448 --&gt; 00:10:06,657
Why did it have a huge influence only after the thaw in Sino-Us ties?

160
00:10:07,209 --&gt; 00:10:12,001
I think it is a question worths considering.

161
00:10:12,292 --&gt; 00:10:13,220
Then, there is another question.

162
00:10:13,260 --&gt; 00:10:19,000
Acupuncture anaesthesis is an important factor to promote acupuncture to the world, 

163
00:10:19,288 --&gt; 00:10:26,702
but why it is not a common method using in China nowadays?

164
00:10:26,796 --&gt; 00:10:28,594
First, we will talk about the first question.

165
00:10:29,008 --&gt; 00:10:29,692
On the first question

166
00:10:29,928 --&gt; 00:10:35,526
It can be proved that traditional Chinese acupuncture,  

167
00:10:35,660 --&gt; 00:10:36,872
except neighboring countries in Asia,

168
00:10:37,194 --&gt; 00:10:41,145
in history, it was spreaded to Europe via Arab countries.

169
00:10:41,217 --&gt; 00:10:44,811
Meantime, it was introduced to America and Australia by Chinese labor.

170
00:10:45,173 --&gt; 00:10:50,000
But it didn't catch the attention of mainstream society at that time

171
00:10:50,325 --&gt; 00:10:52,599
or was just used among Chinese people.

172
00:10:52,651 --&gt; 00:10:56,315
Since the regaining relation of China and America 

173
00:10:56,863 --&gt; 00:10:59,103
and China can be equally treat by western countries, 

174
00:10:59,232 --&gt; 00:11:03,053
they began to gain interest in Chinese culture, 

175
00:11:03,078 --&gt; 00:11:05,645
civilization and traditional Chinese medicine

176
00:11:05,758 --&gt; 00:11:11,000
Although the essence of meridians remains a difficult problem to be overcomed,

177
00:11:11,001 --&gt; 00:11:16,789
they still accept acupuncture after the confirmation of its curing effects.

178
00:11:17,312 --&gt; 00:11:22,766
And at present, due to the difference between cultures, diagnostic methods of traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine

179
00:11:23,185 --&gt; 00:11:29,001
cannot pass FDA and meet the demand of modern medicine and pharmacology.

180
00:11:29,157 --&gt; 00:11:33,000
Therefore, they cannot be recognized by western sociey 

181
00:11:33,161 --&gt; 00:11:34,000
and remains as folk medicine.

182
00:11:34,037 --&gt; 00:11:36,487
Only several regions mentioned above,

183
00:11:36,487 --&gt; 00:11:40,655
like Victoria in Austrialian are accepted.

184
00:11:40,707 --&gt; 00:11:42,000
Then ,what about the second problem?

185
00:11:42,381 --&gt; 00:11:47,345
Domestic scholars have conducted a lot of researches about acupuncture anaesthesis,

186
00:11:47,549 --&gt; 00:11:51,747
In December, 1997, in a  meeting about acupuncture 

187
00:11:51,807 --&gt; 00:11:54,073
hosted by National  Institutes  of  Health, US,

188
00:11:54,122 --&gt; 00:11:59,009
Professor Han Jieshen gave a speech about the principles of neuro and chemstry in acupuncture anaesthesis.

189
00:11:59,167 --&gt; 00:12:05,217
Professor Cao Xiaoting made a experiment about the improvement of immune system by acupuncture and gave a speech of its 

190
00:12:05,498 --&gt; 00:12:06,172
clinical verification.

191
00:12:06,478 --&gt; 00:12:12,479
These all testify that acupuncture analgesia is science-based and  effcient.

192
00:12:12,558 --&gt; 00:12:14,315
And acupuncture anaesthesis has its specific applied range. 

193
00:12:14,315 --&gt; 00:12:20,806
For example, it performs greatly in head, face, neck , abdomen, gynaecology  and  obstetrics and limb surgery.

194
00:12:21,184 --&gt; 00:12:26,257
Hence, after the heat of acupuncture anaesthesis,

195
00:12:26,472 --&gt; 00:12:27,387
we should return to a sensible level

196
00:12:27,761 --&gt; 00:12:31,689
and know that it cannot be applied in an extended range randomly.

197
00:12:32,111 --&gt; 00:12:33,515
Another reason is that 

198
00:12:34,115 --&gt; 00:12:37,235
many patients know nothing about the advantage of acupuncture anaesthesis,

199
00:12:37,308 --&gt; 00:12:42,114
like free from side-effect, and so on.

200
00:12:42,270 --&gt; 00:12:45,375
So, they may not choose acupuncture anaesthesis.

201
00:12:45,546 --&gt; 00:12:48,457
So this reason is the root

202
00:12:48,660 --&gt; 00:12:52,349
cause of acupuncture anaesthesis not being widely used.

203
00:12:52,476 --&gt; 00:12:55,977
Ok, this class is over.

204
00:12:56,000 --&gt; 00:13:01,355
Next time, we will talk about whether traditional Chinese medicine has its value nowadays.
