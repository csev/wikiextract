1
00:00:00,000 --&gt; 00:00:05,000
Last class we have talked about Chinese traditional culture

2
00:00:05,000 --&gt; 00:00:09,000
So let's focus on what's traditional Chinese medicine

3
00:00:09,000 --&gt; 00:00:015,000
who came up with the term &quot;traditional Chinese medicine&quot; is unknown

4
00:00:15,000 --&gt; 00:00:21,000
but we are sure that it's named for the purpose of distinguishing it from Western medicine

5
00:00:21,000 --&gt; 00:00:25,000
In the thousand-year-history, there is no special name as traditional Chinese medicine

6
00:00:25,000 --&gt; 00:00:32,000
none in Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor,Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases,Tang materia medica,or Compendium of Materia Medica

7
00:00:32,000 --&gt; 00:00:36,000
It's called medical science or pharmacology

8
00:00:36,000 --&gt; 00:00:42,000
Concerning traditional Chinese medicine, I'd like to illustrate in the following three aspects

9
00:00:42,000 --&gt; 00:00:49,000
First is about medicine practice under the guidence of traditional Chinese medicine theory
It is about the fundemental definition of traditional Chinese medicine

10
00:00:49,000 --&gt; 00:00:58,000
Second is about how it has influenced our history
Third is to discuss about it in terms of its cultural influence

11
00:00:58,000 --&gt; 00:01:06,000
So let's talk about the definition of traditional Chinese medicine itself
That is, Chinese medicine guided by the traditional Chinese medine theory

12
00:01:06,000 --&gt; 00:01:12,000
To start with, we need to know what is traditional Chinese medicine theory
in order to know what the definition means

13
00:01:12,000 --&gt; 00:01:25,000
Traditional Chinese medicine theory actually involves yin-yang,the five elements,zang-fu, grain,
pathogenesis,disease,Xiaoke syndrome 

14
00:01:25,000 --&gt; 00:01:30,000
Then we will talk about a number of important theories later in the following courses

15
00:01:30,000 --&gt; 00:01:37,000
So what is it the practice of traditional Chinese medicine
For example, we are talking about a man who goes to see a TCM doctor

16
00:01:37,000 --&gt; 00:01:45,000
so can the TCM diagnosis way of looking, smelling,asking,and feeling the pulse
be counted as disease diagnosis
17
00:01:45,000 --&gt; 00:01:49,000
of course.
how about the treatment of the disease

18
00:01:49,000 --&gt; 00:02:01,000
For example, oral administration through acupuncture or Chinese medicine or medicine wine, 
Or topical applicator, Fumigation, or a massage, 

19
00:02:01,000 --&gt; 00:02:07,000
of course these are also considered as the medical practice of traditional Chinese medicine
It also includes Mentoring heritage

20
00:02:07,000 --&gt; 00:02:17,000
Drug content provisioning is also a very extensive collection,for example herbs collection
identification,binary,planting drugs,medicines boiling and manufacturing

21
00:02:17,000 --&gt; 00:02:22,000
We know the perfect high-end classic preparations and some other modern formulations and tablets

22
00:02:22,000 --&gt; 00:02:30,000
and the drug store as well as drug transportation, etc.
Well, from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine 

23
00:02:30,000 --&gt; 00:02:39,000
For example, some prescription and case management in hospitals
Then also we should set standards for drugs and combat illegal agreements.

24
00:02:39,000 --&gt; 00:02:43,000
charlatans is also a noun often talked about in history

25
00:02:43,000 --&gt; 00:02:51,000
So actually the practice of Chinese medicine also includes the R&amp;D of Chinese medicine
For example, do research of chemical constituents by some experiments

26
00:02:51,000 --&gt; 00:02:57,000
Its pharmacological effects of the drug and matrix formulation process
Then education

27
00:02:57,000 --&gt; 00:03:05,000
Let's talk about educational philosophy of Chinese medicine
We now have college education and also a number of private school education, etc.

28
00:03:05,000 --&gt; 00:03:13,000
In fact there is a broader context that includes regimen and treating disease
For example, mental recuperating,doing sports,diet and Diet

29
00:03:13,000 --&gt; 00:03:18,000
For example, in Shanghai popular  Pastes are of the concepts including curing Winter Disease in summer etc.

30
00:03:18,000 --&gt; 00:03:26,000
This is the first issue we are going to talk about.  it is about
Chinese medicine Practice under the guidance of such TCM theory of Chinese medicine

31
00:03:26,000 --&gt; 00:03:36,000
So the second question we are going to talk about is from the perspective of the positioning of TCM
We know in history China has four great inventions

32
00:03:36,000 --&gt; 00:03:42,000
So can TCM be considered as the fifth great invention of China
Or was recommended to a new four great inventions

33
00:03:42,000 --&gt; 00:03:51,000
So we all know China's four great inventions in history
Compass, gunpowder, papermaking and movable typing

34
00:03:51,000 --&gt; 00:03:59,000
But the concept &quot;four great inventions&quot; is not come up with by Chinese people
it is put forward by Western and finally accepted by Chinese people 

35
00:03:59,000 --&gt; 00:04:05,000
as early as 50 years time
Italian mathematician called Girolamo Cardano 

36
00:04:05,000 --&gt; 00:04:18,000
He was the first to put forward what impact the three great inventions China has on the world
it is a sinan, also a compass,and some Chinese call it beizhen. 

37
00:04:18,000 --&gt; 00:04:25,000
There are still gunpowder,printing
And it is regarded as uncompatible in ancient history

38
00:04:25,000 --&gt; 00:04:35,000
Later, in 1620, when the British philosopher Bacon also mentioned in the surname Gong
He said the three inventions are compass,gunpowder, and printing

39
00:04:35,000 --&gt; 00:04:49,000
Has changed all over the world.
from 1861 to 1863, Marx and Engels gave the inventions peak-high meaning

40
00:04:49,000 --&gt; 00:05:00,000
Marx said in speaking of mechanical forces of nature and scientific use 
Compass, gunpowder, printing three great inventions which foresaw the arrival of bourgeois society

41
00:05:00,000 --&gt; 00:05:08,000
for example, gunpowder crushed the Knight class
The compass opened the world market and establish colonies

42
00:05:08,000 --&gt; 00:05:14,000 
The printing becomes a Protestant tool
Overall it becomes a means of scientific renaissance

43
00:05:14,000 --&gt; 00:05:19,000
Becomes a maximum leverage which creates necessary precondition for spiritual development

44
00:05:19,000 --&gt; 00:05:30,000
Engels also talked some about passing China's four great inventions to Europe in Spain 
through the Arab countries 

45
00:05:30,000 --&gt; 00:05:43,000
Yiyuan Shi was the first scholar  who added papermaking into the four great inventions
After comparing Japan and China, he said

46
00:05:43,000 --&gt; 00:05:51,000 
Japan indeed doesn't have excellent discoveries including printing
papermaking and compass, gunpowder 

47
00:05:51,000 --&gt; 00:06:00,000
That means that China has these four great inventions
It was eventually by the British historian and sinologist Joseph Needham

48
00:06:00,000 --&gt; 00:06:07,000
He identified China's four great inventions of this
So in fact, the role of the four great inventions play comes to recede

49
00:06:07,000 --&gt; 00:06:14,000
some think whether to come up with new four great inventions
Apparently due to the historical role Chinese medicine holds

50
00:06:14,000 --&gt; 00:06:22,000
it is reasonable because it exists today and has impact on the world
From the perspective of its historical contribution to human health

51
00:06:22,000 --&gt; 00:06:29,000
and its value now
It is no less than four former great inventions

52
00:06:29,000 --&gt; 00:06:39,000
Accordingly it is suggested that the four great inventions of modern China should be
hybrid rice, kanji laser phototypesetting,synthetic insulin and Coartem

53
00:06:39,000 --&gt; 00:06:49,000 
in fact such inventions as artemisinin or Coartem 
is just one example of drug-resistant invention of TCM

54
00:06:49,000 --&gt; 00:06:52,000
however, actually Chinese medicine is far beyond 

55
00:06:52,000 --&gt; 00:07:01,000
So there are some who believe that on the basis of the four great inventions in China
to consider the value of this in medicine. TCM should be added to the fifth great invention

56
00:07:01,000 --&gt; 00:07:06,000
Of course, there comes to how to set standards.

57
00:07:06,000 --&gt; 00:07:11,000
But through such a short discussion of the importance of traditional Chinese medicine,it is obvious

58
00:07:11,000 --&gt; 00:07:15,000
Next let's discuss Chinese medicine from the third perspective---culture

59
00:07:15,000 --&gt; 00:07:26,000
Some people think that Chinese medicine is unique in traditional Chinese culture
so its cultural value is also very important

60
00:07:26,000 --&gt; 00:07:36,000
If try to  understand the rich spiritual culture the Chinese medicine itself contains from a narrow perspective
For example, talked about concept of yin and yang balance of health

61
00:07:36,000 --&gt; 00:07:42,000
The integrated idea of Heaven and human
Focus on treating disease and mental health recuperating

62
00:07:42,000 --&gt; 00:07:48,000
Even today modern Chinese medicine is highly developed
These ideas still have strong vitality

63
00:07:48,000 --&gt; 00:07:57,000
Broadly speaking Chinese medicine is created by our ancestors
Covering material and spiritual civilization 

64
00:07:57,000 --&gt; 00:08:02,000
It not only has a lot of advanced medicine ideas and concepts 

65
00:08:02,000 --&gt; 00:08:09,000
There are many specific inventions
For example, some treatment methods and drug manufacturing technology

66
00:08:09,000 --&gt; 00:08:16,000
Then there are acupuncture and cupping Scraping
Chinese medicine infusion and medicine manufacturing, 

67
00:08:16,000 --&gt; 00:08:26,000
we can say that Chinese medicine is the concept of health,disease prevention 
and lifestyle culture Chinese people hold for generations

68
00:08:26,000 --&gt; 00:08:34,000
So that's all we talk about
Next lesson we will discuss why to take this course
