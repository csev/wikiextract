00:00:01,085 --&gt; 00:00:05,484
Hello，there is a saying in China that all drugs are toxic. 

2
00:00:05,672 --&gt; 00:00:08,292
It demonstrates the deep understanding of toxicity of Chinese Traditional Medicine

3
00:00:08,575 --&gt; 00:00:12,554
So this lecture, let's discuss the toxic theory of the Chinese Traditional Medicine

4
00:00:12,833 --&gt; 00:00:19,430
Before the Western Han Dynasty, poison is the general term for all medicine 

5
00:00:19,667 --&gt; 00:00:23,222
As is clearly reflected in the records in ancient books

6
00:00:23,502 --&gt; 00:00:31,412
For example it is recorded in the book Zhouli: Tianguan (Rite System of Zhou Dynasty: Court Officials) as follows: The doctors are accumulating poisons to practising medicine.

7
00:00:31,692 --&gt; 00:00:36,092
It is also mentioned in the The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic: Basic Questions and the discussion on the zang-fu organs that

8
00:00:36,375 --&gt; 00:00:40,304
poisons suppress the evil, the five cereals nourish the body and fruits serve as supplements

9
00:00:40,537 --&gt; 00:00:46,575
The legend of Shen Nong who tasted about a hundred kinds of herbs justifies that people started to realise the importance of the safety of medicine from an early time.

10
00:00:46,857 --&gt; 00:00:52,847
The saying that one can come across seventy two kinds of poison further reflects the universality of the toxicity of  medicine.

11
00:00:53,127 --&gt; 00:00:57,153
So people at that time were in great danger when they are takeing medicine

12
00:00:57,434 --&gt; 00:00:59,542
It was once mentioned in the Book of Rites that

13
00:00:59,819 --&gt; 00:01:06,046
The courtiers should first take the medicine for the ill king in case it is toxic and the child should first take the medicine for his ill parent in case it is toxic.

14
00:01:06,324 --&gt; 00:01:08,480
and that one can not take the medicine prescribed by the doctor who practised medicine for  less than three years

15
00:01:08,758 --&gt; 00:01:15,217
I remenber my teacher once told that the medicines recorded in the book Shen Nong’s Classic of the Materia Medica were categorized according to its toxicity.

16
00:01:15,453 --&gt; 00:01:19,617
The book Shen Nong’s Classic of the Materia Medica was written in Eastern Han Dynasty
 
17
00:01:19,897 --&gt; 00:01:25,937
It was the first monograph on Pharmacology by a person who used the name of Shen Nong

18
00:01:26,219 --&gt; 00:01:28,135
He attached great importance to the understanding of the toxicity of medicine.

19
00:01:28,414 --&gt; 00:01:34,312
The poisons were categorized into three levels:top, middle and low

20
00:01:34,641 --&gt; 00:01:38,665
They represented not poisonous, a little poisonous and highly poisonous respectively.

21
00:01:39,042 --&gt; 00:01:42,319
Isn't it too rough to categorize in this way?

22
00:01:42,599 --&gt; 00:01:50,086
Yes , but there has been the awareness to distinguish medicine according to its toxicity

23
00:01:50,363 --&gt; 00:01:56,869
In addition, the basic principles of dosage from small to large was put forward

24
00:01:57,149 --&gt; 00:02:00,801
in order to avoid the serious toxic reaction as far as possible.

25
00:02:01,081 --&gt; 00:02:09,928
For example, it was mentioned that if the poison was used to treat disease, we should start from Panicum miliaceum

26
00:02:10,254 --&gt; 00:02:16,618
and stop taking as long as the disease is cured and try not to increase its dosage and the increase and decrease of the dosage should be limited.

27
00:02:17,088 --&gt; 00:02:19,384
So it is a progressive increase

28
00:02:19,660 --&gt; 00:02:24,250
It is rare and commendable to have such an idea more than 2000 years ago

29
00:02:24,532 --&gt; 00:02:28,225
But such understanding was contradictory against the idea we say today that medicines are all poisonous 

30
00:02:28,506 --&gt; 00:02:33,330
The understanding of medicine during the Eastern Han Dynasty remained in a narrow sense

31
00:02:33,656 --&gt; 00:02:36,417
compared to the understanding of the toxicity of medicine by modern medical field

32
00:02:36,699 --&gt; 00:02:38,989
But with the development of theory of property of medicine in Chinese Traditional Medicine

33
00:02:39,271 --&gt; 00:02:44,469
such as the knowledge of warmness, heat coldness and coldness and the knowledge of the ascending descending floating and sinking as we mentioned just now

34
00:02:45,175 --&gt; 00:02:49,246
people's understanding of the toxicity of medicine gradually entered the broad sense of toxicity

35
00:02:49,527 --&gt; 00:02:54,160
that is the deviation of the medicine (towards warm or cool) and there is little medicine which is absolutely flat in property. 

36
00:02:54,441 --&gt; 00:03:01,885
So it will be reasonable to account for the toxicity of medicine according to its degree of deviation.

37
00:03:02,163 --&gt; 00:03:03,989
for an example,

38
00:03:04,319 --&gt; 00:03:09,699
It was once reported that Ginseng and Rhizoma Anemarrhenae were also resulted in poisonous reaction even they were once considered as non-toxic.

39
00:03:09,935 --&gt; 00:03:13,490
It was because the dosage was excessive 

40
00:03:13,774 --&gt; 00:03:16,717
or the medicine was taken for a too long period, such kinds of reasons are all relevant.

41
00:03:17,000 --&gt; 00:03:20,275
So it is not difficult to understand from the deviation of medicine,

42
00:03:20,555 --&gt; 00:03:24,632
the excessive use of a particular kind of medicine which has a certain deviation will definitely cause toxic reaction.

43 
00:03:24,863 --&gt; 00:03:28,748
In this sense, toxicity and effectiveness are related.

44
00:03:29,031 --&gt; 00:03:31,600
So the treating process using Chinese Traditional Medicine is in fact 

45
00:03:31,835 --&gt; 00:03:34,878
a process of correcting the disorder in the patients by using the deviation of the medicine.

46
00:03:35,159 --&gt; 00:03:40,588
Yes. To make it easier: the principle of treating diseases using Chinese Traditional Medicine is using deviation to correct deviation

47
00:03:40,868 --&gt; 00:03:44,894
and how to understand the saying &quot;cure a poisoned patient with poison&quot;?

48
00:03:45,127 --&gt; 00:03:48,404
and it also belongs to the principle of using deviation to correct deviation

49
00:03:48,636 --&gt; 00:03:54,161
The difference is that the deviation of the medicine used is a little strong and the disease to be treated is a little die-hard

50
00:03:54,393 --&gt; 00:03:55,893
the symptom is a little serious and so on

51
00:03:56,171 --&gt; 00:04:04,175
If we use some medicine which is more toxic to treat diseases such as serious sore and swelling toxin, scabies ,crewels and tumour etc.

52
00:04:04,412 --&gt; 00:04:06,094
What we should pay attention is that

53
00:04:06,375 --&gt; 00:04:09,934
such saying often results in some wrong understanding

54
00:04:10,163 --&gt; 00:04:14,144
for example the medicine with strong toxicity has to be used for patients with tumour

55
00:04:14,376 --&gt; 00:04:16,861
for example using Chinese blister beetle and centipede to treat 

56
00:04:17,090 --&gt; 00:04:21,303
this is the narrow sense of cure a poisoned patient with poison and it is different from the concept in Chinese Traditional Medicine

57
00:04:21,538 --&gt; 00:04:25,935
It is similar to the principle of treatment of the cytotoxic drugs in modern medicine

58
00:04:26,219 --&gt; 00:04:33,003
It is known that arsenic is effective in treating leukemia and does it accord with the principle of curing a poisoned patient with poison

59
00:04:33,285 --&gt; 00:04:35,155
this is a good question

60
00:04:35,437 --&gt; 00:04:40,630
the chemical composition of arsenic is As2O3 and it is acquired by sublimation from the arsenolite
 
61
00:04:40,913 --&gt; 00:04:43,955
It was once used as the poison for murder in history

62
00:04:44,188 --&gt; 00:04:49,523
There is an old Chinese Traditional Medicine doctor in our country in the 1970s

63
00:04:49,757 --&gt; 00:04:53,927
A secret prescription made by him treating scrofula once contained arsenic.

64
00:04:54,158 --&gt; 00:04:56,358
It was then used for the treatment of skin cancer and it was effective.

65
00:04:56,589 --&gt; 00:05:00,146
Later it was changed into injection and used for treating many kinds of cancer. 

66
00:05:00,475 --&gt; 00:05:02,206
Based on this,

67
00:05:02,487 --&gt; 00:05:08,058
a scholar in Haerbin Medical University found that arsenic can treat leukemia

68
00:05:08,338 --&gt; 00:05:10,211
but the mechanism of treatment is unclear 

69
00:05:10,490 --&gt; 00:05:14,656
Later scientists such as Wang Zhenyi in our Ruijin Hospital found that

70
00:05:14,890 --&gt; 00:05:20,644
the arsenical can contribute to the differentiation of the premyelocyte and can kill cancer.

71
00:05:20,926 --&gt; 00:05:26,261
the result of this research caused a sensation throughout the world

72
00:05:26,543 --&gt; 00:05:28,695
So after the year 1998

73
00:05:28,931 --&gt; 00:05:35,671
It was widely accepted in the international medical field that arsenic can treat the acute promyelocytic leukemia.

74
00:05:35,954 --&gt; 00:05:40,956
So the property theory of Chinese Traditional Medicine and its application was derived from practice

75
00:05:41,283 --&gt; 00:05:47,185
and it has application value and deserves further application by modern research in order to benefit human beings

76
00:05:47,463 --&gt; 00:05:52,191
hat is all about chapter four
