<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_we_need_punctuation">Why we need punctuation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Punctuations are dash, colon, semicolon, parenthesis,...</li>
<li>To vary sentence structure, make it more interesting and engaging.</li>
<li>People think punctuations are <em>informal</em> and not suitable for scientific writing. However, they're really useful if you know how to use.</li>
</ul>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_use">How to use</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Semicolon">Semicolon</span></h3>
<p>You can use semicolon in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The semicolon connects two independent clauses. Use it when you want to link two small sentences together and emphasize the second clause.<br />
<strong>Example</strong>: Kennedy could be a cold and vain man, and he led a life of privilege. But he knew something about the world; he also cared about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Semicolons are also used to separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation.<br />
<strong>Example</strong>: They dramatically reduced the number of series in production: in 1935, fourteen series were circulating; in 1940, nine; by 1980, when the syndicate was in its final years, only four.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Parenthesis">Parenthesis</span></h3>
<p>Use parentheses to insert an <strong>afterthought</strong> or <strong>explanation</strong> (a word, phrase, or sentence) into a passage that is grammatically complete without it.  </p>
<p>If you remove the material within the parentheses, the main point of the sentence <strong>should not change</strong>.  </p>
<p>Parentheses give the reader <strong>permission to skip over</strong> the material.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: What kind of teenager beats up on the misfit, sissy kid, pinning him down and violently cutting his hair with a pair of school scissors—the incident from Romney’s youth that the Washington Post famously reported (and Romney famously didn’t really deny) back in May?</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Colon">Colon</span></h3>
<p>Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification.  </p>
<p><em>“The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash.”</em>--Strunkand White  </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Washington has a simple solution to most governments it doesn’t like: isolate them, slap sanctions on them, and wait for their downfall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The woman suffers from lack of experience and a chronic Democratic disease: compound sentences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Use a colon to join two independent clauses if the second amplifies or extends the first. The first clause usually set up the second clause.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Companies use Marsh for the same reason that home sellers use real-estate agents: the agent’s knowledge and experience is supposed to help the client get the right deal at the right price.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dash">Dash</span></h3>
<p>Use the dash to add <strong>emphasis</strong> or to <strong>insert</strong> an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence. Just don’t overuse it, or it loses its impact.</p>
<p><em>“A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses.”</em>—Strunkand White</p>
<p><em>“Use a dash only when a more common mark of punctuation seems inadequate.”</em>—Strunkand White</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1:</strong> The drugs did more than prevent new fat accumulation. They also triggered overweight mice to shed significant amounts of fat—up to half their body weight. <em>(emphasis)</em></li>
<li><strong>Example 2:</strong> To establish that the marrow cells—also called adult stem cells or endothelial precursor cells—can colonize the eye, Friedlander and his colleagues first transplanted stem cells from an adult mouse into the eyes of newborn mice. <em>(definition)</em></li>
<li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Researchers who study shipworms say these mislabeled animals—they’re clams, not worms—are actually a scientific treasure. <em>(emphasis and added information)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_rule_of_three.E2.80.99s_.28lists.2C_examples.29">The rule of three’s (lists, examples)</span></h2>
<p>When you want to introduce a list or examples, you should use <strong>three items</strong>.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> They dramatically reduced the number of series in production: in 1935, fourteen series were circulating; in 1940, nine; by 1980, when the syndicate was in its final years, only four.</li>
</ul>
