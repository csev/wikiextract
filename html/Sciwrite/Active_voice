<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_you_should_use_Active_voice">Why you should use <strong>Active</strong> voice</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>It's the natural way and easier to read.</li>
<li>In passive voice, reader can't know who did it, who takes responsibility for the verb.</li>
<li>Using passive voice doesn't make your paper more objective.</li>
<li>Style guidelines for many journals actually explicitly will tell you to write in the active voice.</li>
<li>You should use active voice in most part: abstract, introduction, results, or your discussion...</li>
<li>However, you should use <strong>passive voice</strong> for <strong>method sections</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Is_it_OK_to_use_I_and_We">Is it OK to use <strong>I</strong> and <strong>We</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>It's OK, and you usually have to use it to make an Active voice sentence.</li>
<li>You have to admit the fact that you did the experiments, using passive voice doesn't make it more objective.</li>
<li>You're putting your name as an author, so you are taking public responsibility for its content.</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="When_to_use_Passive_voice">When to use <strong>Passive</strong> voice</span></h2>
<p>You should use passive voice in <strong>method section</strong>, because in that section:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was done is more important than who did it.</li>
<li>Readers tend to skim the methods section for keyword rather than reading it as prose.</li>
<li>You have to start many sentences using "We" or "I".</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>

<li>a recommendation was made by the DSMB committee that the study be halted.

<li>Major differences in reaction times of the two subjects was found.

<li>=&gt; We observed the major differences in reaction times of the two subjects.</li>

<li>It was concluded by the editors that the data had been falsified by the authors.

<li>The first visible light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA's Hubble space telescope.

<li>Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete, and an able bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are not different was rejected.

<li>=&gt; Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete, and an able bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are comparable.</li>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_indicates_active_versus_passive_voice.3F">What indicates <strong>active</strong> versus <strong>passive</strong> voice?</span></h2>
<p>Words or phrases such as: was, has been, and believed; indicate a past experience for the reader.  When writing in <strong>active</strong> voice, remove negatives to positives by providing a present experience for the reader.</p>
<p>In cases where a past experience is necessary for the reader; for example, the sentence, "They did not believe the drug was harmful" use "They believe the drug is determined to be harmful. This is considered active voice indicating a past experience. </p>
<p>Note, in the examples above, we have removed the negatives but added verbaige to the sentence for clarity and purpose.</p>
<p>To eliminate added verbaige such as "to be" which indicates <strong>active</strong> voice, use:
<ul><li>They believe the drug is determined harmful.</p>
</li></ul>
