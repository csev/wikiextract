<p>Strong verbs assert an action about an subject or object.  Let's look at a few samples of strong verbs. </p>
<p>Note, when reviewing this information, simplicity is not always the answer.  The audience varies based on the environment in which you write as does the level of technical content.  </p>
<p>For example, documentation written for a medical practitioner versus a web document on "causes of cancer."  In most cases, the web document is written to target a global audience and the document written for a medical practioner is written for a specific audience.</p>
<p>Example:
<pre>
Stephaine presented her oral argument in the court room today.
</pre></p>
<p>Verb:  presented</p>
<p>Example:
<pre>
The wide scope of practice and resultant requires breadth of knowledge
demand and frequent use of medical literature.
</pre></p>
<p>Verb: requires, use</p>
<p>Example:
<pre>
The question can be formulated as follows: (1) among elderly males with acute 
STEMI about to undergo coronary revascularization, (2) does the addition of a 2b/3a 
inhibitor to standard therapy, (3) versus standard therapy alone, (4) reduce infarct size?</pre></p>
<p>Verb: formulated, addition, undergo, reduce</p>

<p>Verb to nouns transformation occurs when there is an action without an object in a sentence.  </p>
<p>Example: Verb
<pre>

</pre></p>
<p>Example: Noun
<pre>
Preform the arithmatic operation of addition.
</pre></p>

STEMI about to undergo coronary revascularization, (2) does the addition of a 2b/3a 
inhibitor to standard therapy, (3) versus standard therapy alone, (4) reduce infarct size?</pre>
<p>Answer key: revascularize</p>
