  <p><em>The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - these are thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to the education and rank.</em> 
  -- William Zinsser in <em>On Writing Well</em>, 1976</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be vigilant and ruthless. After investing much effort to put words on a page, we often find it hard to part with them. Try the sentence without the extra words and see how it's better -- conveys the same idea with more power.</p>
