<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.1_The_Scientific_Inquiry_of_Carl_Woese">2.1 The Scientific Inquiry of Carl Woese</span></h1>
<p>I'm Bruce Fouke from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. So when we look at the historical development of the philosophy of science and evolutionary biology, there are some fundamental, very large, names, very well-known names of people that you do know, people like Socrates, people like Darwin. These are household names. They occur in all aspects of our society and they're recognized as being pioneers and people who fundamentally set the stage for understanding how science works and for giving us some understanding of how evolutionary biology works.  </p>
<p>However, the field of evolutionary biology is rapidly moving forward, is driven in a large part by technological developments, the ability to analyze DNA, which we haven't had before, and it's moving forward extremely fast. And therefore, the most fundamental conceptual ideas of evolutionary biology are just being published now. They're not in most textbooks, they're not being discussed around the kitchen table, yet this is where the field is going.  </p>
<p>So what we're going to be doing in our journey of evolutionary biology together is to recognize these massive accomplishments by the scientists that you don't know of now who will be household names in the near future. And I think especially important to us, for this evolutionary biology course is the history of Professor Carl Woese and his research here at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Professor Woese began with a true grassroots movement on campus, in the department of microbiology, and, started to use new tools that hadn't been, applied before, and really set out on this journey to try to find a universal, a unifying theme of how to look at this great diversity of life we have on the planet: what are the essential elements of that life that let us compare all life to each other and understand what the fundamental structure of life is?  </p>
<p>So we found right away that the oligonucleotide catalogues for these eukaryotes had a common signature which was different than the signature for the bacteria. Well, here comes this pattern on the wall and I read this is from the first archaea... and I say "Where are the bacterial spots... that are unique for bacteria? They're not here." And then I worked my way up in what's called the G isopleth that contains no U, and here I came to another signature oligonucleotide that is characteristic of all bacteria... and it wasn't there. And this continued, and my excitement grew. What was this beast? So we went all through it and... and the first thought was, "This isn't even a prokaryote." That was a very exciting day.  </p>
<p>And so his work for the first several years, it was very hard to get funded, it was, something that a lot of people flat out rejected or were very cool to, and he had a lot of â€¦ he was ostracized a lot by the community, and this was played out both in terms of, getting students, having grants, allowing papers to be published. But then eventually, he was able to, have some fundamental benchmark papers published, and the one that we're going to be going back to, later on and discussing in more detail is the paper where he puts out, holistically, a structure for life based on the composition of specific genes and their frequency and occurrence within different organisms, through geological time.  </p>
<p>[Germanic accent] Carl Woese, he had done his analysis already, and, based on a few differences which were very, very significant, and he worked obviously very, very precisely, and, as I know now, of course, a very honest scientist, and so he found really that these organisms which all have been misclassified by the old, chemical-thing, that those were placed in a different, in a separate top, in the tree of life, and by his method, and this was for me, it was unbelievable that he really ... that he seemed to be able to trace back, microbial life almost to its roots. And at that time, there's nobody who had thought this would ever be possible, and so this was so exciting. He identified the gene, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence, that could be compared in all things that are living, and that comparison then yields evolutionary relatedness and became, finally, the tool that fundamentally changed science and let us have a structure for science and a structure for biology.  </p>
<p>Before then, before Woese, 1977, the ideas were wrong, and still are wrong in our textbooks, as you know, in many regards. A third process of evolution that we don't know about yet, but we have a much better idea of what that was in the context of Woese's big tree. So I would argue that, again, before 1977, biology writ large is not a science, and when Woese put in place the experimental grounding, that made biology a science.  </p>
<p>Now before Professor Woese did his work, the general paradigm, the general thinking of the large-scale concept of, well, what's the general structure of life on Earth, how many types of life are there, the answer was universally two. There were prokaryotes, which are the single-cell organisms, and there are the eukaryotes, which are the multiple-cell organisms, and that's all there was. And for decades, once that was established, people thought, "Well, the answer's there. That's what the structure of life is, and we need to move forward, and anyone who challenges that, is a heretic who should be, you know, figuratively, burned at the stake."  </p>
<p>So, that's what Professor Woese was against, and then as his work matured and refined, he started seeing this pattern of the structure of life, and it wasn't twofold, it was threefold. So instead of having two branches of life, the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes, we had three branches of life: the bacteria, the archaea, and the eukarya. So that three-pronged tree of life is the fundamental structure on which we are going to base the rest of the course.  </p>
<p>At that moment of publication, it changed fundamentally how science is done as it relates to biology throughout the planet, and everything was different from that moment forward. So that's one of the goals of the course is to understand that revelation and how that revelation now is tied to making predictions and understandings, not only of the historical evolutionary biology, but also the prediction of where biology is going to go in the future.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.2_The_Place_of_Carl_Woese_in_Evolutionary_Biology">2.2 The Place of Carl Woese in Evolutionary Biology</span></h1>
<p>(Nigel Goldenfeld) So I'm Nigel Goldenfeld, and I'm a theoretical physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. So you're familiar with the idea of a family tree; you have a family tree. Your parents gave birth to you, you give birth to your children, everybody is descended from everybody else, and you can build that up into a tree structure. So that idea is one that is pervasive in biology, and the question that I want to talk about in today's lecture is not your family tree or my family tree, but the family tree of all life on Earth. Now you may think, "Well how could we possibly "know the family tree of all life on Earth?" But amazingly, we actually do know it. It was actually determined right here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, about 30 or so years ago, and it was determined by Carl Woese who was a professor of microbiology and one of my colleagues at the Institute for Universal Biology.  </p>
<p>So I want to tell you about how we know the history of life on Earth, and then what that knowledge has told us about the structure of life and how it could have arisen and how it may have arisen elsewhere in the universe. And this is a very surprising story, and it's a story that is still being written because we don't know all the answers, and in fact we're going to see that trying to understand the history of life, is like using a telescope to look back into the furthest reaches of time.  </p>
<p>So let's start off with the history of life on Earth. So, how do we, how do we try to explore that question? So Carl Woese's idea was very simple. He said, "Look, if I'm going to study, life, on Earth, I need to have some kind of bar code, some kind of measure of every single organism, something that I can be guaranteed to find in every living cell."  </p>
<p>So what do cells do? Well, cells reproduce, they metabolize, they do various functions in the body, but one of the things that they have to do is they have to reproduce and they have to also learn what they're supposed to do from their genome, from the genome of the cell. So the cell has a number of basic functions, then. So just to summarize, a cell starts off with its DNA. Ultimately, the cell functions by making proteins. To make proteins it has to read the instruction set that is written down in the DNA, and to do that, it first of all transcribes the DNA into messenger RNA. The messenger RNA is then processed by a machine called the ribosome, and that ribosome is the thing that takes the amino acids, the basic building blocks of life, strings them together to form every protein that makes up you.  </p>
<p>So Woese's reasoning was very simple: every cell must have a ribosome in order to function. This ribosome is fundamental to every living cell, and so therefore, if we want to understand, the history of the cell, we should look at the history of the ribosome. We should look at the history of this translational machinery, and from that we can learn something about how cells evolved.  </p>
<p>So to do that, what he started doing, back in the 1960s, was to start to look at the molecular sequences that encode the parts of the ribosome. Now the ribosome is an incredibly complicated machine. It has lots of proteins in it, it has ribosomal RNA, and for various reasons, Woese decided to focus on the ribosomal RNA. And what he did was, he found a way, using what's called Sanger sequencing, a very difficult and time consing and, in fact dangerous, experimental technique, to find the molecular sequences of parts of the ribosomal RNA. And then what he did, laboriously, was to find the molecular sequences for as many organisms as he could get into his laboratory and then look at the results.  </p>
<p>Now here's the idea of how you can take that sort of data set and turn it into an evolutionary history. So the idea is this: that you have a molecular sequence; that molecular sequence is different from organism to organism. It's different for the bacteria <em>E. coli</em> than it is for humans. It's different between humans and from corn, and so on and so forth. And by looking at the small differences between the molecular sequences, you can sort of say, "Well these ones are different here and different there. Maybe they're different because, there was a mutation and that turned this one into that one." And so by various statistical techniques, you could try to find out the most likely evolutionary path of these molecular sequences. And that's what Woese started to do, and by 1977, he had enough data to actually publish the first results of that.  </p>
<p>Now, the first results were very surprising. Prior to Woese's work, it was thought that there were really just two kinds of life: eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Now, what is a eukaryote? Well, you're a eukaryote and plants are eukaryotes. In fact, eukaryotes are simply cells that have a nucleus to them, a nucleus where the DNA matter is stored, the chromosomes. The other sorts of cells are single-celled organisms like bacteria (round, blobby things that you can see under a microscope), and those were called prokaryotes because the idea was that they're simpler than eukaryotes, and perhaps they preceded the eukaryotes, in the timeline of evolution. So that was the basic idea.  </p>
<p>Well, that turned out to be completely false. Woese blew that out of the water, because what he discovered was that in fact life could be split up into three types, not two, and it wasn't just that they were three different types, but he could infer their evolutionary relationship. So what he discovered is shown in the phylogenetic tree. That phylogenetic tree has got three branches, or the domains of life as they're sometimes known, the eukaryotes, the bacteria, and archaea. If you look at the eukaryotes, they include the usual suspects, but if you look at the bacteria and the archaea, they both look like round blobby things under a microscope, but they are as genetically different from each other as you are from bacteria; they're completely distinct.  </p>
<p>And furthermore, you'll see from that tree that the archaea and the eukaryotes, which includes you, have themselves a common ancestor, and then that branch itself meets with the bacteria at an earlier point in time. And they defined it in terms of this, all of which were trivial characteristics, and the only one that came through at the end was the prokaryotic cell wall, and the prokaryote cell wall even collapsed when the archaeas were discovered and the wall structure was determined.  </p>
<p>So that was the big surprise then, that there are three domains of life, and it's not that the single-celled organisms were less complex than the multicellular eukaryotes. They are, but they evolved simultaneously with them over evolutionary time. So they're not like an earlier stage, and then life blossomed into its fullest form.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.3_Revolution_of_the_Tree_of_Life">2.3 Revolution of the Tree of Life</span></h1>
<p>(Jan Sapp) My name is Jan Sapp. I'm a professor in the history of biology at York University in Toronto, and I write about the history and philosophy of biology. So Woese writes a book in 1967 called The Genetic Code, but it's a very unusual book because that book was embedded in evolutionary biology; it was all about how the code evolved. Molecular biologists ignored evolution. Molecular biologists weren't concerned with evolution. Molecular biology turned into, primarily, an engineering discipline. What can we do with this stuff? It was just sort of something we had to know about the secret of life, but it itself didn't want to understand its own evolution, thought it was off, to speculate about the origin of life was merely that it was speculation; let's get serious and do real science.  </p>
<p>That was around the time that I said to myself, "This is biology. To study biology you have to study evolution." And so I set up this system that could do it. This was the first system that could do it. That was the oligonucleotide cataloging. Well Woese wanted to do that with respect to the origins of the genetic code, to say, "Well, how can I study the genetic code without speculation? How can I have an empirical study of the evolution of the translation apparatus?" So his answer was, "Well, if I can make a deep phylogeny, that is, if I can order simple microorganisms, say bacteria and eukaryotes... back to some ancient forms, perhaps I'll find organisms that have a different translation apparatus, and then I can order them in terms of the way in which the translation evolved."  </p>
<p>So he starts to do that, and he picks, a molecule, that is part of the ribosome. The ribosome is at the heart of the translation machinery. He thought all organisms that we know have ribosomes, organisms and, you know, not viruses, but all organisms that have both have DNA and RNA and that can synthesize proteins have ribosomes, so here's a universal characteristic. It's an essential characteristic, just like Darwin's essential characteristic, just like Lamarck's essential characteristics, though, Woese read neither, you know, he broadsided the field, knew nothing about, you know, classical evolutionary biology.  </p>
<p>So he begins to work on ribosomal RNAs, and with the idea that if he can look at the sequences, and in those days you could have very short sequences up to about 13 nucleic acid units, right, base pairs, right, and so the first thing he did was, "Let's see what sequences "within these rRNAs and these ribosomes are universal to all bacteria," for example. And so he finds patterns that all bacteria have. Finds other patterns that all eukaryotes have. The idea of molecular evolution was that it was a clock, and this was the clock that Linus Pauling and Emil Zuckerkandl published in 1965, that the genetic code or nucleic acids (information molecules) will change like a clock, as a steady beat like that, and that is to do with just random mutations. It's neutral; selection doesn't act on that. It's like a car with the engine going before you put it into gear, right?  </p>
<p>And you can have lots of variation before you actually change the protein and evolution will only see that protein. I mean, that's the theory. So through studying the pattern of these changes in the nucleic acids, and in information molecules, whether they be amino acids or nucleic acids, one is studying in part it's a clock, an evolutionary clock. Woese thought that the RNA molecule was the ultimate universal chronometer. Well, when he arrives at University of Illinois in 1964, the program of molecular phylogenetics gets up certainly by the late '60s, he has about 15 years where nobody knows really what he's doing.  </p>
<p>By 1990, everything breaks because Woese makes a formal taxonomical proposal. You know, the evolutionists tolerated him before because he's sort of invisible. Okay, everybody knew there's this guy who seemed to be a little bit cranky, making all these remarks about what they take to be iconic concepts in evolutionary biology, pretending now, that he can, you know, order life through one molecule, you know. And he teamed up with really â€¦ he didn't have much support in the United States. Great support in Germany, with Otto Kandler and Wolfram Zillig and Karl Stetter, and these were really important for this story. But in 1990, to flash forward to1990, when they make the formal taxonomical proposal that there are three domains, the Archaebacteria he wants to redefine now as the Archaea, and the reason he did that was that full-blown genomics, comes about. The human genome project emerges by 1990. Around that time, one could now sequence all the genes in an organism. This was amazing.  </p>
<p>Well, Woese and Gary Olsen here at University of Illinois put out a proposal to sequence, I think it was an Archaebacteria, and they were turned down on the grounds that they already had a sequence of <em>E. coli</em>, you know, and one didn't need to sequence any more of these things; you've seen one, you've seen them all. I mean, that was the attitude about bacteria; they're all the same, aren't they? I mean, give me a break, you know. It was, you know, the old joke about there's two kinds of bacteria, <em>E. coli</em> and the other one, right? And that was basically the view of things, especially from the part of morphologists, who say, "Come on, these things are all the same. Don't give me- Woese wants to analyze these things in terms of molecules, but this is absurd. You can't compare the difference between bacteria and an Archaean and compare that distinction to a kangaroo and a giant sequoia. It's absurd to think that that's a distinction, you know, that would make a new domain."  </p>
<p>So Woese made three higher taxa, right, proposed three higher taxa above the kingdoms. So his argent was there would be three fundamental domain- three fundamental lineages of life: the Eukarya, the Bacteria, and the Archaea. And the reason he called them the Archaea was because he didn't want the word bacteria associated with them for the reason that because people thought that all bacteria were the same, alright. So it's sort of a biopolitical argent. He called them domains because he didn't want militaristic concepts in biology, you know. Ah, before we were, you know, in the middle ages, it was all kingdoms, you know, and that's what- and we still use this middle-age kind of expressions, kingdoms of nature, you know. What does that mean, and why are we still living in kingdoms? I mean, you know, we're in democracies now; we don't need royalty, you know. I mean, who are these people, you know? But now we still have these noble kingdoms, pretty bizarre, right? And then, you know, people wanted empires, you know, empires as being, you know, very large areas of conquest and military conquest, and those were the words that Woese tried to avoid. So he and Kandler had a big discussion about trying to find a neutral term, you know. But biology is, you know... embedded in social relations. There's no escape from our human situation, so good luck with finding a word that doesn't have sociopolitical connotations, you know. But that was the best they could do, so they called them three domains, you know.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.4_Evolution_of_the_Tree_of_Life">2.4 Evolution of the Tree of Life</span></h1>
<p>So the advent in 1977 of molecular phylogeny recast and restructured, fundamentally, how we look at the emergence of life on planet Earth. Now, an important context for our modern-day understanding of the emergence of life is to look at how different and how drastically changing and evolving itself the whole concept of evolution has been over the last 150 years, and in fact even deeper, into human history than that. So what we want to do is take a look at the changes in evolutionary thought and how people had tried to graphically structure the Tree of Life, and then see how fundamentally different that the departure is for the results of Carl Woese and his colleagues here at the University of Illinois.  </p>
<p>So, we need to start all the way back actually in 1674 when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who was a, a scientist in Holland, developed the first microscope, and that first microscope was actually a brass plate with a few very crude lenses, and a setting screw that allows you to change, the angle and therefore the magnification of the lenses. Well, Leeuwenhoek is very famous because of that development of the microscope, and he's the first one who actually published an observation that there was life on a very small scale, and that microscope was strong enough for him to see one micron cells, some of which were bacteria. Some of them were Eukarya, the more advanced forms of cellular life on the planet, and that publication in the "Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Science" was a benchmark. It was the first time that human beings had seen life active at that kind of scale.  </p>
<p>The next step in the process was about 100 years later. In 1735, Linnaeus, who was a Swedish scientist, decided to use primarily the observations of the diversity of life on planet Earth for morphology, the size, the shape, the color, some of the attributes of how the organisms lived to use those to break all of life into pieces and compartments that can be used to look at the structure and eventually the historical evolution of life. And Linnaeus came up with two kingdoms he called them. One was the animals and one was the plants. And so, Linnaeus was critically important for developing the ability to describe morphological differences, and move forward with that kind of what we call taxonomy, that descriptive taxonomy of what was living.  </p>
<p>Well, and again, about another 100 years plus had passed and in 1866, Haeckel decided to start structuring not only morphologies you could see with the eye, but also some morphologies you could see under the microscope. Now remember, this is long, long before the genetic tools were available, so this was using whatever tools of observation were possible at these times. And what Haeckel put together was a very different kind of tree. Again, Linnaeus had animals and plants.  </p>
<p>Haeckel, as you can see from this, also had plants and had animals, but also had another small group of organisms called the Protists. And these Protists were single cells or sometimes multiple cells, but they were small and they moved around and he could see they had these different morphological features; they had some different colorations. But then also he broke things into another group called the Monera. And the Monera were what we call in the present day the single-celled microbes that eventually were Bacteria and Archaea. So the Monera was kind of a loose grouping of single-celled organisms. The Protists were the more complex yet still small organisms, and he kept with the plants and the animals.  </p>
<p>Well, another 100 years plus passed, and there was a benchmark work by a scientist named Whittaker in 1969. And you can see from the Whittaker tree of life, there was this concept of having eukaryotes, and that was one of the earlier times that eukaryotes had been coined, and then we had prokaryotes, and those were all the single-celled, small organisms. So going from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and you can see that tree makes it a very linear progression of the two, implying that eukaryotes evolved directly from the prokaryotes and all of the prokaryotes. And you can see some of the same names were kept. The Monera were part of that prokaryote group, and the Protists, again, these more complex, small single-cells. So the Whittaker tree is actually what is still used in a lot of applications within science today, and can still be found in some textbooks.  </p>
<p>Well, the advent of the 1977 publication by Woese and Fox, and then the ensuing publications, especially Woese et al 1990, reset, fundamentally, the stage of how we understand that the structure of the evolution of life on this planet took place. So all these came together to produce a drastically different looking tree of life, and in this tree of life you can see that we're hovering in a helicopter, if you will, looking down at the uppermost branches of that tree of life, and in the middle we have an origin. We have a root or a stalk, versus having these three branches, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, coming up and out.  </p>
<p>The importance is that the context of the history of the evolution of the idea of a tree of life itself really sets the stage for us because it compares and contrasts what was thought of as being simpler life and more complex life and what came first and what came second. Instead of some of those paradigms and hypotheses that were put up, and very reasonably, based on morphology, the genetic tool, the molecular phylogeny allows us to quantify these relationships and look deep into time to see how diversity on this planet is actually structured in terms of its capabilities of lifestyles, ecology, but then even more importantly, its genetic composition.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.5_How_Did_Life_Emerge">2.5 How Did Life Emerge</span></h1>
<p>A drastic change took place in the world of biology in the year 1977. And that change has revolutionized how we look at the emergence of life and how we look at the history of life itself on this planet.  </p>
<p>(Carl Woese) This is a real strong evolutionary tool, and if you didn't have the bacterial signature, you just weren't bacterial, and the same for eukaryotes. And it took me the better part of... I don't know, maybe I'm being kind, of ten minutes to say, "Something's wrong here; something's wrong with prokaryote." And that's when I started... deconstructing.  </p>
<p>(Karl Setter) He was a real eye-opener. So, also for me, but also for the other people, of course. His work was groundbreaking. It was so novel and it gave so much excitement over to my science.  </p>
<p>(Bruce Fouke)So what does, then, the emergence of life look like using these brand new tools of molecular phylogeny?  </p>
<p>Well, one of the first ideas is that in the very early Earth, the earth had what we call a prebiotic soup. It had all kinds of chemicals on the earth's surface at high temperature that ended up in being some of the components that were used, of the building blocks of life, but really, life hadn't taken a foothold and emerged at that time. So before we had life, we call that the prebiotic soup. Then, the concept that is derived from using these molecular tools is that we initiated the formation of some of the molecules of life, including RNA, including perhaps partial pieces of viruses, and some other small molecules that are required now to build complex cells, but we didn't have cells at all; we just had some of the molecules that make up cells. And some people have called this the naked RNA planet, where we had these molecules moving around in these chemical soups, if you will, at the very early stages of life.  </p>
<p>Well the next thing that happened in the process, again using this molecular phylogeny, is that some of those molecules became more complex, and the RNA itself, the composition of some of these other molecules became larger, but we still didn't have cell walls, or if we had cell walls they were very different from the kind of cells that we think of now. And so, that's been called the progenote.  </p>
<p>The progenote is, again, we haven't moved to a point where we have cells as we know them now, but we've gone from a primordial soup to molecules that are in cells, that are free-floating without having cell walls, to having some loose affiliations of cell walls that aren't at all like the cell walls we have now, and some of the more complex molecules. And that progenote stage was very important because, without cell walls, that means that all those molecular components were all free-flowing between everything that was merging towards cellular life as we know it.  </p>
<p>Then a really dramatic change took place, and that was called the Darwinian transition, and the Darwinian transition is when cell walls actually formed. So cell walls went from a proto-early loose stage to a real cell wall as we know them now. And at that Darwinian transition, then the cell walls captured these molecular components, and at that moment then we had the genesis of the three domains of life, and that's what was described in the 1977 paper by Woese and Fox.  </p>
<p>Those three domains of life are called Eukarya, which are the groups that we're part of. These are the more complex, often multicellular organisms, although some organisms can have one cell that are Eukarya, and we use the word microbe to describe that. So the word microbes can be any type of single-cell organisms, but many of the Eukarya have multiple cells.  </p>
<p>Then another branch, that was very closely related to the Eukarya, are called the Archaea. These are the small cells, again, about 1 micron in diameter, but these are very unique. They don't have any kind of a membrane around the internal molecules of that we call the nucleus in the middle of the cell. And they're also the organisms that, among other things, can produce methane, which is very unique in terms of the different types of life that are on this planet.  </p>
<p>The other branch that came up at about that same time out of this Darwinian transition we call the Bacteria. We're familiar with these in terms of humans becoming sick, and these were also organisms that were one cell, and they did not have a formal nucleus or membrane around the middle part of the genetic components of the cell.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.6_The_Genetic_Code_and_Evolutionary_Theory">2.6 The Genetic Code and Evolutionary Theory</span></h1>
<p>(Nigel Goldenfeld) So in today's lecture, I'm going to talk about evolution before there were genes. So this is the genetic code, and it's a remarkable code for many reasons.  </p>
<p>The first reason is that the genetic code is universal. We have the same genetic code as jellyfish. We have the same genetic code as corn, as pigs, as elephants. Every animal has the same genetic code. That's how we can do genetic engineering, which you've doubtless heard about. We all have the same genetic code, so take genes from a jellyfish, stick them in you, you'll glow green. Isn't that great? So, you couldn't do that if we had different genetic codes. So that's the first attribute of the genetic code; that it's universal.  </p>
<p>Now, there's a second one that really was only fairly recently discovered, going back about 20 years or so, and this is the following: the genetic code is extremely good at minimizing errors. So let's suppose there's been a mutation so the sequence in your genome has been slightly screwed up. Or let's suppose that the translation apparatus doesn't work very well and makes a mistake. You're going to get the wrong amino acid. If you get the wrong amino acid, you'll get the wrong proteins. If you get the wrong proteins, you'll die. That's not good. So wouldn't it be great if you had a genetic code that if you make a mistake, the amino acid that you get is going to be pretty close to the one you should have got, and therefore, hopefully, won't make too much difference? So guess what? Our genetic code is as pretty much as good as it can possibly be at minimizing those sorts of errors. So it's really, really good at mitigating the effects of this kind of misreading or this kind of mutation. In some sense we'll say, then, that the genetic code is optimal. It's not truly optimal, but very, very close to optimal.  </p>
<p>I want to answer the question, now, of how it came to be that the genetic code had this structure. Now you might just say, "Well, the genetic code is optimal but, you know, how good is very good? How likely is that to have arisen by chance?" Well we know the answer to that. I can't explain to you in this lecture how we know it, but it's the probability of this happening by chance is much less than 1 part in 100 million. So something happened, something special happened, and what happened was that the genetic code evolved. In fact, it evolved before the last universal common ancestor. It had to have evolved before the last universal common ancestor because if it evolved afterward, we wouldn't be able to do molecular phylogeny to look at the translation apparatus to deduce the existence of the last universal common ancestor.  </p>
<p>So, we know there was life before the last universal common ancestor, and we know that during that period of time when life was starting to sort of get going, the genetic code evolved, and it must have evolved very rapidly so that of 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago, we had a fully functioning genetic code.  </p>
<p>So, question: what evolutionary mechanism is there that can evolve things so fast that something as complicated as the genetic code could evolve in a very quick time scale? Well, I've already told you the answer in this lecture. There's only one thing that can do it, and that's horizontal gene transfer. So the same mechanisms that are causing the bacteria in your gut to evolve rapidly and defeat the medical community's attempt to counter bacterial infections, those same evolutionary mechanisms, generalized evolutionary mechanisms, gave rise to the evolution of the genetic code and the evolution of the cell more than 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.  </p>
<p>(Jan Sapp) Darwin shifted the question of evolution to the origin of species and focused on the origin of the species as in the title of his book. Not big tree, not the big universal tree of life, no. But Darwin argued in order to have a deep evolutionary phylogeny, or deep evolutionary genealogy, that is, classifying organisms naturally in terms of the way in which they evolved in the course of evolutionary history, one had to distinguish between trivial characteristics and the essential characteristics of an organism. Again, Darwin's world was a world of plants and animals, and how you did this with animals was easy. Well, it wasn't that easy, but it was easy in the sense that there were morphological traits that were deep in the organism. So Darwin argued the best way to do it was to look at embryonic characters, because those characters would evolve very, very gradually, and they may in fact be stable, highly conserved in evolutionary time, whereas adaptations would be piled on top of these deep, highly conserved developmental characteristics.  </p>
<p>Well, none of that was available for microbes. Microbes didn't have embryos, you know, didn't have great morphologies, and the way in which one classified, ever since Darwin, was to do comparative morphology, alright. So now we're caught in another false dichotomy, just like the plant-animal one that we try to group all of life into, or one between the prokaryote and eukaryote that we try to group all life into. Even our evolutionary concepts, our conceptions, of life on Earth, generally, we have this other dichotomy, and that dichotomy is are you a Darwinist or are you a creationist? Creationist meaning that you invoke supernatural phenomena on Earth to account for the course of evolutionary time, that you don't believe we are of this Earth, that we're created in some other fashion, but not by natural processes on this earth. So the problem with that dichotomy is that evolution and Darwinism are conflated; they're seen as one thing. To pose the question, "Are you a Darwinist?" is to say you are an evolutionist. If I say, "Are you an evolutionist?" the automatic response is, "Oh, you're a Darwinist," alright?  </p>
<p>And so what I'm saying, is that we have to break away from that dichotomy because it's a false one, and that we can be evolutionists without being Darwinist, and we have to understand that our principles of evolution have to evolve, and they evolve with the data, and we've only begun to have access, and we're just scratching the surface of the great diversity in the microbial world, and there may be other things afoot. You know, that Carl Woese likes to talk about a cosmic evolution, right, I mean, I've always believed that evolution is bigger than life, way bigger than life. You have evolution first, then you think about life, and if that's true, then we have to think of cosmic principles through which life is formed. Life is not an accident. So I think 100 years down the line people will know Woese's name just like we know Darwin's name â€¦ 100 years down the line.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.7_Throwing_Rocks_at_Earth:_The_Martian_Meteorite">2.7 Throwing Rocks at Earth: The Martian Meteorite</span></h1>
<p>Mars has given us a lot of good things over history of time. Mars has given us, first of all, the ability to be fascinated about a red planet that we actually can see with our naked eyes on some nights. It's a place that has driven all kinds of science fiction fantasy, invasion of the planet. It was very important, of course, for, ancient cultures, and its position within mythology in other aspects of culture.  </p>
<p>So, Mars is a critical component of the human experience, but something about Mars that we don't think about is how fundamental it's been for driving forward our ability to understand a new version of evolutionary biology in the context of a changing Earth. And that fundamental capability of Mars to change the way we think was driven by the following: every year a huge amount of rock material, and I'm measuring this in terms of tons, so tons and tons of rock material on a yearly basis has been dislodged from Mars because of meteor impacts, blasted into the solar system, thrown into the pathway in which the Earth is spinning around the sun, and every time the earth goes through a dust and rock field that was generated by debris being blasted off of Mars from meteor impacts, every time the earth goes through these clouds of dust and rock, that dust and rock is collected into the atmosphere and falls to the earth.  </p>
<p>Now we know some of this from the space shuttle heat shields. The heat shields have been analyzed and every time the space shuttle goes in and out, it would collect rock and dust material. And by analyzing the chemical composition of the rock material that is collected from the heat shields, Mars has a very distinct chemical signature from that of Earth, so we have a fingerprint. If we have a rock that came from Mars, we can tell that distinctly from a rock that came from Earth. Now what's really exciting about this is that not only are the space shuttles great collectors of Martian rock and dust, but on a natural process, rock and dust hits the earth, it settles through the atmosphere, it hits the planet's surface, and the rock and dust that hits the surface on the ice fields, places like the Antarctic where we have 1.8 kilometers of ice that's just sitting there on the poles. That ice field becomes the perfect trap for collecting dust and rock that falls in from space and hits the planet.  </p>
<p>Now, at any one time that dust and rock will hit the surface of the ice, and then as more snow falls and more ice is formed, then that dust and rock gets collected and trapped within the ice. Now, ice sheets like the Antarctic are really dynamic places, and by that I mean that is in some places, they're forming, in some places they're melting. And on a yearly basis, parts of the ice sheet are known to actually melt or what we call ablate, go from one phase that's actually a solid ice phase directly into a gas phase without becoming a fluid or water. So parts of the ice sheet are changing and going from solid ice into water vapor, and in those places the ice sheet deflates; it actually decreases in mass, and anything that's trapped within the ice becomes sitting on the top of the ice as the ice slowly fades away and becomes more compressed and dense underneath of it.  </p>
<p>So you have the ice sheet, then, disappearing, and it's rock and ash and particle load that is collected over the millennia is now sitting free on the surface because of that deflation of the ice. Well NASA's known this for a long time, so every year, NASA scientists go up and they take snow mobiles and they collect all kinds of meteors that have hit the earth. Meteors are actively flying through space. A meteorite is one of these meteors that has hit the planet and stopped moving. So they go around the ice sheets and collect meteorites off the surface of the Antarctic. And those meteorites are put into massive collections that are held at the Smithsonian or at NASA or at other places. And they're held for future, analysis by scientists because every year enough are collected to overwhelm the scientific community. There's a lot of material that needs to be looked at.  </p>
<p>Well, we got really lucky, because of a confluence of circumstance that came together. One of those was that NASA had an ongoing research program in terms of looking at meteorites that had hit the earth and then looking for fossil evidence of what that life is. Another one is that some of the right meteorites were actually collected, and so there's a famous one that ended up being the rock sample, the meteorite that changed the face of science and our ability to understand evolutionary biology, and that's called the famous Martian meteorite.  </p>
<p>And the Martian meteorite was given a name; it's ALH84001. If you <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.google.com/#q=ALH84001">Google that number</a>, you will be amazed at what you find. That was the number given to that a particular meteorite that was collected in the year 1984, since thence the number 84, and it was collected from a part of the Antarctic ice sheet called the Allan Hills, ALH. And the Allan Hills region of the ice sheet, at that time, in 1984, there was a beautiful potato-sized rock that was laying there, a meteorite, and it was collected, given that catalog number and then put into a collection.  </p>
<p>Well, a few years later, a NASA scientist, especially out at NASA Ames Research Center out in California, they started looking for fossil evidence of microbes within rock, and it's not easy to do. Microbes, their average diameter is 1 micron. These are small, small creatures, and they have many aspects of them that are hard to distinguish from non-biological entities. So telling the difference between a biological fossil and a non-biological fossil that's on the scale of 1 micron is a major challenge. So NASA scientists were looking carefully at these meteorites that were collected, and the ALH84001 turned out to be a piece of orthopyroxene.  </p>
<p>Orthopyroxene is a form of igneous rock. Igneous rocks you know about more commonly are things like granite. People like to put them on their counter tops. Well orthopyroxene is another form of igneous rock. It's crystals that cool and grow together, that come out of a molten mass of rock, and this particular meteorite, it was formed originally as an igneous rock on the planet Mars. And then while it was still on Mars, it formed, became a solid rock, and then it was fractured, and we don't know exactly the process that fractured it, but some kind of strong geological process would have had to have fractured the rock while it was still a component of the crust of Mars.  </p>
<p>Now, after the rock was fractured, waters started moving through the rock, and as waters move through rock like that, oftentimes they'll precipitate minerals. So you can have elements that are dissolved in water, and if you flow the water over something, change some of the physical chemical conditions, you can actually have those elements go from being ions in the water to something that's solid.  </p>
<p>Now you do this in reverse all the time. If you want to put, sugar into your coffee, right, you'll put sugar in and then you'll stir it, and it goes from a solid sugar clump into disappearing, which means all the ions that make up the sugar go into the water.  </p>
<p>So as these waters on Mars flowed through these fractures in the piece of orthopyroxene, they precipitated a very important mineral, the mineral calcite, calcium carbonate, CaCO_3. And calcium carbonate is really important to us because calcium carbonate is often associated, not always, but is often associated with biological activity. If something is living there and they do some kind of a process to keep themselves alive, then one of the things that happens as a result is the water will allow the ions to go from being dissolved to being a solid mineral.  </p>
<p>So these solid rock minerals actually grow out of the water as the water flowed through these cracks, and they were trapped in the calcium carbonate and filled up this fracture in this igneous rock from Mars. Now we have good and actually very excellent analogues for this, comparative environments on Earth, where we see this happening all the time. A very famous one is Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, where the waters come up to the surface of the earth after being heated by a supervolcano. They are full of ions that, once the waters cool and allow some of the gas to escape from those waters, they precipitate calcium carbonate at incredible rates, very, very, very fast. So we know from Earth environments that this can happen.  </p>
<p>Well, all this process took place on Mars, but then one thing happened a very long time period after that rock was formed, is that a meteor hit Mars, created a crater, and then blasted rock material into space. Then that chunk of orthopyroxene with the fracture filled with calcium carbonate, with potential microbial fossils in it, it traveled... through the solar system. It left the orbit of Mars, went into orbit around the sun, and as the earth came around, it entered the earth's atmosphere and then plunged to Earth in the Antarctic.  </p>
<p>Then the funding agencies, especially in the United States, but also in other countries, began, making opportunities for scientists to look carefully at what is a fossil that is microbial in origin versus what is a fossil that is not microbial in origin. And therefore, the famous Martian meteorite really opened the door for scientific discovery to lay the boilerplate, then, for us to understand the genesis of life, not only on planet Earth, but also, potentially, on Mars.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.8_Microbial_Mats_and_Stromatolites:_Laying_Down_on_the_Job">2.8 Microbial Mats and Stromatolites: Laying Down on the Job</span></h1>
<p>We want to take a look at the most common fossil that we find in the geological record that is indicative, or at least possibly indicative, of microbial life. We've already discussed that microbes make up 60% of what's living on planet Earth, and therefore, you'd reasonably want to then find some kind of a fossil record of microbes to help understand the history of that organism that dominates our planet.  </p>
<p>So what do we mean by microbial life? Well, the microbial life that actually was occurring during the Archaean was cyanobacteria. So a lot of people get cyanobacteria confused because it is green and they photosynthesize, which is not necessarily indicative of just a plant. Bacteria were actually one of the first organisms to photosynthesize before plants even appeared on the earth. So cyanobacteria are actually, bacteria that have cells, but they lack some of the characteristics of eukaryotes.  </p>
<p>So the primary type of rock that houses this paleontological fossil evidence of microbes is called a stromatolite, and the stromatolite is actually a highly controversial term. The reason it's controversial is not because of what it describes, but because of what it might indicate. So the word stromatolite is actually a finely layered sedimentary rock, layers of rock that are on the scale of tens of microns to hundreds of microns to millimeters, so very finely-laminated layers of rock that have been acculated through geological time, with the oldest at the bottom and the youngest at the top.  </p>
<p>So stroma in Greek means "layered." Lite, or lithos in Greek, also means rock. So stromatolite is just "layered rock," very simple, very easy, and these layers are very, very thin. And so how I usually try to understand stromatolites are that most stromatolites, not all, but most stromatolites are actually produced by some kind of biological indicator or force, such as cyanobacteria.   </p>
<p>Now, we know that in the modern oceans, microbes can grow on the sea floor, and as the microbes grow they make a sticky, gooey mat that sticks together the cells and protects them from the rest of the marine environment, and because it's sticky it actually allows sediment, small grains of sand and clay, to stick and acculate. So as the microbes are growing on the sea floor in some places, the sand grains and the clays, they acculate, and they make layer upon layer, and these layers, again, are millimeters or smaller.  </p>
<p>So the reason why cyanobacteria actually grow through the sediment and create a whole other layer is that the cyanobacteria are photosynthesizing, so they require sunlight. So if you have sediment on top of you and you can't get any sunlight at all, so they have to actually grow through it and create a whole nother layer, and eventually more sediment will come live on top of them and they'll have to grow through that again. So that's why you get multiple layers of microbial mat and sediment.  </p>
<p>So those...occurrences in the modern day ocean, where we know there are microbes growing and acculating these kind of sediment layers, those stromatolites are known to be of biological origin, and therefore they are a living preserved record of microbial life. Now that's all fine and good for the modern, but one of the problems is when we go to the ancient geological record, we find immense deposits of stromatolites. We find stromatolites that are literally kilometers in thickness, and these were growing on ancient sea floors or sometimes in caves, or even in hot springs. So stromatolite deposits, finely layered sedimentary deposits, are very, very abundant, but the million-dollar question is which of those stromatolite deposits are microbial in origin and which of those can actually be formed by non-biological processes?  </p>
<p>So the idea of having very thin layers of sediment that are laid down one after another through geological history, as I mentioned, it can happen when microbes are present and the microbial biofilms, the mats, stick together the sediments, but we also have very good evidence from experiments in the laboratory and also modern natural settings where we can make these finely layered sediments, and there were no microbes around whatsoever. There are details in the structure of the stromatolites, things like, well sometimes the stromatolites make a bulbous, almost pillow-shaped deposit, and parts of the bulb are anti-gravity, if you will. And the thinking there is that well, you can only stick sediments together to make a layer and have those be anti-gravity, sticking against themselves, if that stickiness is driven by some kind of microbial mat. But what we see is that there can be changes in temperature and viscosity and density of the water, and these factors combine with a myriad of chemical changes that can actually make a non-biological stromatolite.  </p>
<p>So stromatolites are critically important to us. We know that some large proportion of them are microbial in origin, but understanding which are microbial and which are not takes an extremely intensive and long amount of work on any one geological deposit to make that inference. As NASA lands spacecraft on other planets, like the Curiosity is doing now, we're hoping that one of the types of rocks that the Curiosity will collect is a stromatolite because it is possible that those might be microbial mat deposits from ancient life that occurred on Mars, but careful evaluation will have to be done to be able to prove or disprove the concept of whether those finely-layered sedimentary structures are biological in origin or non-biological in origin.  </p>
<p>So understanding the fossil record in this context, this ability to go into the ancient rocks, either on another planet or on Earth, and decipher whether or not they are the product of biological activity or non-biological activity is kind of the fundamental boilerplate of us exploring the ancient life that occurred on Earth, as well as the ancient life that potentially has occurred on other planets.   </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.9_Oxygenation_of_the_Atmosphere">2.9 Oxygenation of the Atmosphere</span></h1>
<p>Just take a deep breath, a really, really deep breath. That's probably the thing that we take most for granted as human beings. Well, that breath you just took, the gases you consumeded into your lungs at that moment, the oxygen that your, lungs and your blood vessels were filled with, that oxygen is something that was not created by planet Earth itself. It was actually created by biological activity.  </p>
<p>What happened is that the early Earth had no oxygen. It was a very hot place, very acidic place, and it had very different kinds of landscapes. Nothing in terms of multicellular organisms had evolved yet. It was a pretty difficult place to be, unless of course you were one of the early anaerobic non-oxygenated microbes that liked to live in an environment with no oxygen. So we had bacteria and archaea, a few eukarya, but not a lot of other things. And in that early Earth, oxygen was actually very toxic. In the modern day planet, all of us know that you can smell hydrogen sulfide, that smell of rotting eggs, very clearly, and in fact our noses, our olfactory system, has been designed and evolutionary crafted to be able to give us an early warning system of toxic gasses like sulfide. But in the early Earth, there was a lot of sulfide and there was no oxygen, and in fact then the oxygen on the early Earth was the gas that was very toxic.  </p>
<p>Well, as organisms began to evolve, and especially the bacteria, they were able to, develop, a geochemical, biochemical pathway that allowed them to combine things like CO_2 and sunlight to produce sugars they needed for theirselves, as well as oxygen. And so that was called photosynthesis, and photosynthesis was a process that was evolved not by plants, but by bacteria. So the earliest bacteria came on the earth 3.9 billion, 3.8 billion. We know for sure that there were microorganisms fossilized by about 3.7 billion years. So in that kind of time frame, we had the very early onset of these microbes living on planet Earth in an environment that had a lot of toxic gasses to us, which are not toxic to them, and there was almost no oxygen. Then they evolved the physical, biological process of photosynthesis, and that photosynthesis was first developed by bacteria in environments with no oxygen.  </p>
<p>Well the photosynthetic reactions in the organisms that do those became so prevalent, so efficient and so widely-distributed that photosynthesis was going on every place around planet Earth, and the oxygen that was produced by that photosynthetic activity flooded the atmosphere and flooded the oceans with oxygen, and it flooded them to an extent, then, that oxygen built up and built up, and by 2.5 billion years before present, which is the boundary between the Archaean and the Proterozoic time periods, in the Precambrian, the Earth had become oxygenated. So what was originally a very scarce and low-abundance gas became one of the dominant gasses that prescribed the environments in which all future organisms were going to evolve.  </p>
<p>So photosynthesis itself was evolved by microorganisms, by bacteria. And eventually through time, that process was transferred over to the eukarya, the multicelled eukarya that are algae and plants. And that process itself, a biological revolution took place, flooded our planet with oxygen and made it the oxygenated Earth that we are accustomed to and take so for granted. You can almost not imagine another process on planet Earth which can be driven by biology that can so fundamentally change everything that happens from that time point forward. So even oxygen itself is a biological product on planet Earth, and once that oxygenation kicked in, then all other evolutionary biology was fine tuned to these environments that were dominated by oxygen.  </p>
<p>So next time you take a deep breath, don't take that oxygen for granted. Those oxygen molecules were produced by as a result of photosynthetic activity of originally, bacteria, and now plants, which are flooding, continually, the atmosphere and the oceans with oxygen. And that event of biologically-driven oxygenation of the atmosphere, which reached very high levels by about 2.5 billion years before present, is fundamentally the benchmark event that set the stage for all the ensuing evolutionary biology that we've seen take place during the Proterozoic and then throughout the Phanerozoic.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="2.10_Snowball_Earth:_It_Did_Freeze_Over.21">2.10 Snowball Earth: It Did Freeze Over!</span></h1>
<p>So we want to consider the earth as a series of spasmatic, catastrophic, terrible events, actually, that have taken place, and the reason we want to understand that is because those are the kind of events that life has responded to. The organisms that are alive at the time the events happen, some of them have the right characteristics. They are able to reproduce in a certain way. They can get food in a certain way, They're actually in an environment that was less affected than others, but they have characteristics that they've evolved that then would allow them to be more successful than others when the environment changes.  </p>
<p>So one of the most striking ones, and especially relevant to the modern day discussion in our society about global warming, is the idea that the earth has been much warmer than it is now, and that it was especially warm during the time of the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous. But another time period that is equally dramatic, but in the opposite direction, is about 0.6 billion years ago at the end of the Proterozoic. The entire earth froze. We had ice sheets that moved all the way from the poles down through the mid latitudes, and ended up with sea ice on the equator, and we call that Snowball Earth.  </p>
<p>Now there are discussions about Snowball Earth, about whether or not it happened, and then to what degree it took place. Some scientists now are suggesting that maybe we had a slushball Earth, where instead of having true ice at the equators we had slushy ice at the equator, but the bottom line is that the earth's temperature had dropped dramatically. And in that process, as the earth cooled, then water was drawn out of the oceans and then formed ice sheets, both on the continents, but then it spread out onto the open oceans as well.  </p>
<p>So the Snowball Earth was dramatic, and I want us to, visit just briefly what some of the evidence for this is. And at the same time, we need to recognize that when we talk about ice in the open ocean, the open ocean is deep water, and at the bottom of that deep water we have microbes, bacteria and archaea that are actively doing their everyday lives. They consume organic matter, they extract energy from the environment, and they recycle organic matter and put it back up into the ocean water. So happily at the bottom of the ocean, while the top of the ocean is freezing, we have organisms that are, doing their lifestyles at those locations, and we have a geological deposit that represents both the effect of and the presence of ice at the equators and the development of microbial mats on the sea floor.  </p>
<p>So, one of the things we can look for in the geological record that are a fingerprint of a glacier, and one of the most, easy to find and least controversial of these are what we call dropstones, and a dropstone is simply the idea that a piece of rock that made up a continental landmass was gouged and ground and brought up into an ice sheet that formed on a continent, which we call a glacier. Then that ice moves and creeps slowly out towards the open coast and into the ocean.  </p>
<p>And when it gets to the ocean, it breaks into pieces and it forms icebergs. So, when those icebergs, that have the rock material that they derive from the eroding continent they were on, when those icebergs float from the northern latitudes into the equator, then they melt. And as they melt, this load they have of rocks, it drops out of the bottom of the iceberg and it falls down onto the sea floor. So that deposit we call a dropstone, and it'll have the rock types of the landmass on which the original glacier was formed.  </p>
<p>So those dropstones at the equator indicate that we had a very much colder Earth. Now, we have other lines of evidence that has to do with the chemistry of some of the rock deposits at that time, and some of that chemistry, such as the oxygen isotopes, allow us to reconstruct what the temperature was directly of the sea water at that moment. But taken as a whole, the dropstones along with this other, data is indicating that, yes, we had a very cold planet and yes we had ice sheets at the equators, temperate ice sheets, and then ice covering the equator. So that's one thing: good dropstones at equatorial zones in the oceans.  </p>
<p>Now the next one is at the same time that all of us have some strong familiarity with metal, iron ore. Every one of us who go into a building in which there's iron girders, every one of us who ever ridden in a car, every one of us who have ever taken a plane ride, and we're all familiar with iron and different types of ores. So, this is something that might not be unknown to you, but you might not have thought about where some of the metal comes from that, let's just say, it makes up your car.  </p>
<p>So it turns out that, during this Proterozoic time period, and actually back into the Archaean as well, in the deep oceans, we had fluctuations in the amount of oxygen, the amount of nutrients, and also the amount of dissolved metals, things like iron. Iron becomes dissolved when the oxygen drops to low levels within the ocean, whereas when the ocean becomes well-oxygenated, then the iron chemically bonds with the oxygen and it precipitates a metal ore.  </p>
<p>So the thing that we want to think about there is that we have a fingerprint of microbial mats and microbial activity on the deep sea floor, in a very unique kind of deposit, called a BIF, a banded iron formation. And banded iron formations are ubiquitous around the planet in these age rocks. Now, if there are ocean rocks, and a lot of the rocks that are preserved at this time were deposited in the deep ocean.  </p>
<p>So banded iron formation is composed of the following. Imagine you're very deep down into the ocean, far below where sunlight is able to penetrate, so on the order of kilometers in water depth, and on that sea floor you have organisms, that are forming these gooey, ooey microbial mats, and those organisms, they don't use oxygen, and they also are not able to photosynthesize. And so they have to have a lifestyle, and that lifestyle for them is they basically breath iron. So iron(III) is taken into their cells, and then they use that iron to actually generate proteins and actually create energy, ATP, the basic currency of life. So they're going about their lifestyle just trying to survive and using the raw materials that they can get their hands on, which in this case is iron. So, in that process of bringing iron into their cells and utilizing it, they can drive the precipitation of the iron into a solid mineral, and those solid minerals are forms of hematite, goethite and some of the other iron-rich metals that we see forming. So when you have microbial mats and these organisms are going about their lifestyle, they bring iron into the cell and the end result is they precipitate the iron ores. So you get a pure iron ore that's driven by the metabolic activity of microbes that are living on the sea floor, and these pure iron ores come out in finely-layered, stratified rock deposits called banded iron formations.  </p>
<p>Now, they're different from stromatolites in that stromatolites are sedimentary rock deposits. These are also sedimentary, but they're not made out of sand grains; they're not made out of individual grains and clay components. They're actually composed out of metal minerals that are precipitating out of sea water and driven by the metabolic activity of the organisms.  </p>
<p>Now banded iron formations are very beautiful. Oftentimes the iron, oxidizes to a bright red, so if you see it, in a rock outcrop, it has these beautiful layers in around the order of tens of millimeters to maybe a single millimeter and even thinner in thickens, and you have layer upon layer upon layer, and so you see these bright red layers that are intermixed with, oftentimes, a grey to a black. And so, those also have some metals in them, but it's also other types of sediments or mineral precipitation on the sea floor. In the end, it makes these beautiful banded iron formations, BIFs.  </p>
<p>And the BIFs are important because they're a good indicator of ocean circulation in the ancient oceans and also the activity of these ancient microbes. So we find BIFs, primarily concentrated in the Archaean time period, then up through the Proterozoic.  </p>
<p>So this is the type of fingerprint we see in the rock record that tells us definitively we had a deep ocean, lack of oxygen, iron was mobile and available to these organisms to breathe and take into their cells. The end product is to precipitate these iron ore mats. You drop a stone from a melting iceberg that's just above it, a few kilometers in water depth, and then you continue the process forward.</p>
