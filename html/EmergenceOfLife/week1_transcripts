<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.1_Scientific_World_View">1.1 Scientific World View</span></h1>
<p>In order to fully understand how evolutionary biology has linked with the history of the Earth and resulted in this amazing complexity we have on the planet, a very useful approach is to consider how a scientist views the Earth on which they live and how the scientific mindset is actually structured to move forward to deal with the amazing complexity that we're surrounded with on a daily basis.  </p>
<p>One of the first thoughts is that, as you look around and see nature and see your surroundings, see society, that, a scientist would say, first of all that it's understandable. At some fundamental level, no matter how complex it gets, or unpredictable it seems, we can understand it at some level. I like to say that scientists are actually quite optimistic people instead of pessimistic because they do see possibility even in what some people would call the impossible.  </p>
<p>Another scientific view of the world is that the ideas of your world, of how you view it and evaluate it, are going to change. So there is not a definitive truth that will be anchored once it's established and stand the test of time. It will stand the test of time in terms of being evaluated, but it won't be the end answer because science will always be moving forward and finding new frontiers. This whole idea that scientific endeavor then, once you apply it to these complex surroundings you're in, it's the idea that the work that is done, even though it will change, that specific body of work is durable, or it's something that can withstand the test of scrutiny, and that's an important idea here because a scientist would want their work to be absolutely excellent and rigorous, but there's also a knowledge is that as technology advances and concepts advance, that the field will move forward, but whatever you do accomplish can always be gone back to and be defended and argued as relevant and real.  </p>
<p>Another thing that a scientist would have deeply implanted is the idea that you can't have complete answers to everything. You can get partial answers and you can get very well-established responses to questions that you put together via experimentation or observation, but you will never have every single answer, and that's something that society doesn't like. Society likes to have lots of answers.  </p>
<p>Fundamentally, science has to be both reproducible, in other words, not matter when and where and who does the work, if the same approach is done, that it will reproduce the same results. So science has to be reproducible, but also another litmus test of the efficacy of science is that it has to be predictable. In other words, you have to be able to make predictions in the future of what might be happening in natural or social or environmental phenomenon. So there must be reproducibility and there must be predictability, and if those aren't engaged, then the scientific result is inadequate.  </p>
<p>Another thing that's really important: people think of scientists as automatons almost, and people who are shedding every part of their humanity to be a scientist, and I would argue that it's actually the opposite, that science depends on people who are imaginative and clever, daring, willing to do things that people haven't done before. All the aspects of human nature that I think are some of the most beautiful to capture all need to be embodied in the scientific endeavor. So far from being robotic, a scientist needs to bring forth the best in people, and it's a truly human endeavor in that way.  </p>
<p>And because science is completed by humans, then of course, along with the strengths of humanity, like I said, courage and vision, there are also all the weaknesses of being human. There's bias, there's inconsistency, there's tiredness, there's frustration and so, all these factors come into play to describe and constrain, the way that a scientist would want to approach what they're doing.  </p>
<p>Now this is probably best expressed in a simple look at what are some of the end members or some of the spectrum of scientific approach. The list I just gave, it sounds good, but then how's it actually coming out in terms of the application, and the end result of scientific endeavor.  </p>
<p>And so one of the ways we look at this is that one end member we call reductionism, one end member we call holism, and there's actually a third variability that runs right down the middle.  </p>
<p>So let me just explain to you, reductionism has been practiced in science really since its founding, and it's the idea that, well, if you use your powers of observation and use the latest technology, you can identify what the individual pieces are of something that's complex.  </p>
<p>So if you had a car that didn't work, and let's say the carburetor was bad, and you went to a garage that said "reductionist garage" on the top, then the mechanic in that garage would have you bring in the car, ask you what was wrong, And then that mechanic would say "Okay, well to understand your problem, I'm going to take your carburetor out, and I'm going to take all 3,746 pieces and lay them on the table, and then once I lay them all on the table, I hope I'll see something that gives me an idea how to put it back together." Well, that's a valuable approach, and it gives a lot of information, but I think that all of us might be a little wary of spending a lot of money for someone who's going to have 3,700 plus parts sitting on a table and may or may not know how they fit together.  </p>
<p>The other extreme is called holism, and the holistic aspect is that someone would say "Well bring your car here, and I'm going to look at all the parts. I'm going to start with the bumper and the fender and the hood, and then I'll get to the carburetor, and then I'll have every single part kind of understood and put together in a very generalized sense, but I'm not sure always that we're going to know what all the individual pieces are." That would make me equally nervous, right? I think to be really good at fixing a exhaust system is a different set of tools than fixing a carburetor. So I'm not sure I would want to go to the holism garage as well.  </p>
<p>But, there is one, repair shop that I like to plug into on a regular basis, and I think this is the one that gives a lot of strength to the approach of studying evolutionary biology, and that's the middle path between the two. There's a mantra or a statement that somewhat encapsulates this, and it's that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. So in other words, the best way to move forward now is to use a blend of reductionist and holistic approaches, and the way to do that is you'd want to carefully pick the few detailed parts of the system that you know will have relevance and importance in terms of how the system works, but you're not going to describe and analyze every single part, and at the same time you want to understand how that part fits into the whole.  </p>
<p>And so you won't want to have just the carburetor, but maybe there's some kind of back pressure coming from the exhaust system that's preventing, you know, efficient firing in the cylinder, so you do need to have some idea how the system works, and this idea of system sciences is very important now and it's moving forward. So, the middle path is what we're after in this kind of scientific endeavor to truly understand the manifestation of evolutionary biology in the context of the history of the Earth.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.2_Philosophical_Benchmarks_in_Science">1.2 Philosophical Benchmarks in Science</span></h1>
<p>I want us to discuss the basic understanding of how we do science, how did science originate, what brought us to the moment of applying science in a way that we can ask very complicated but very meaningful questions about the history of life, evolutionary biology, and how the Earth came to be. So to do that let's encapsulate that in a discourse about the nature of science, what does science provide for us and how did science come to be? Now, again, this is not a philosophy course. There are courses that will go into great detail about this, but a short encapsulation. I believe is very important for us to understand how we use the the basic concepts throughout the class.  </p>
<p>So one of the things that I think we should start with is the idea of critical free thought. Now, there are many parts of our society that critical free thought thrives, and its' actually the underpinning. There are other parts of our society that do everything possible to stop critical free thought, and this is not a new thing. Actually, society used to squash and try to destroy all forms of critical free thought.  </p>
<p>So let's start with society several thousands years ago, and then we're going to come up to the modern day. So one of the great heroes of scientific endeavor is Socrates. Socrates lived from about 470 BC to 399 BC, and he lived in the time period in ancient Greece where society was very hierarchical, and that's truly what Socrates did for us. Socrates brought the idea, I describe it as society at that time in many ways was kind of a dark void within a large balloon, and Socrates came and brought a pinhole, pricked the balloon and brought a small pinhole of light into a dark morass, and that dark morass was that society would tell people what to do and that was the end of the story because it was truth.  </p>
<p>Socrates brought to the table the idea that, well, let's employ critical free thought, let's use our mind, let's use our reason, let's use our senses and let's discuss this. And that discussion process of using those techniques and then having an open free discourse, he called that the dialectical method, and that Socratic dialectical method is the idea that you freely, critically evaluate and challenge, and you even go to one more step, where the instructor or the professor or the politician or whoever is guiding the discussion takes the attitude of a devil's advocate. In other words, taking a stance that that person may or may not believe in, but using it as a leveraging tool to draw out from the participants what they really think and what their evidence is for that.  </p>
<p>So the Socratic method was critical, but what I think is especially sobering is that the Socratic method was the step forward towards accuracy and truth, but it was also the death sentence for Socrates because eventually society responded very negatively to this, and society not only was unhappy, but they put Socrates to death; they put him in prison and they forced him to drink, hemlock.  </p>
<p>Now, one of Socrates' students, Aristotle, ended up being one of the first true paleontologists who thought about evolutionary biology. Now, it wasn't couched in those terms, but Aristotle did a lot of hiking in the mountains throughout Greece, and when he was high up in the mountains he thought about and wrote about the idea that he saw fossils in rock that were lifted out of the ocean, and he saw those fossils lived in the marine environment, and he deduced from that that those rocks must have formed in the ocean and then uplifted by some kind of force. he also saw that in those rocks, the fossils that are at the base of the rock, corals and brachiopods and clams and snails, they changed from the bottom of the rock to the top of the rock, and he further deduced that, there must be a history of evolutionary biology change. again, he didn't use these words, but he observed that. So-so our first true paleontologist/evolutionary biologist was Aristotle, and then we've had a little bit of time, in human history to move forward from that.  </p>
<p>Now some of the questions that Aristotle would want us to bring to the table for studying evolutionary biology are things are: What is your main point? can you give me a good example of what you're talking about? Can you summarize for me what you just discussed? what are you assuming? what kinds of ideas do you know, but not know, and then what are you assuming might be possible to, support your assumption? What evidence do you have? That's always a good one, right? What real evidence do you have versus some kind of an emotional knee-jerk response to something you feel strongly about? you know, we as humans are always trying to decipher those things, and really culling out true cold and hard fast evidence from emotion or from, assumption is really, really good. And then other things like what can you generalize from this, and how can you make predictions because fundamentally science has to be reproducible and predictable, and if it doesn't fulfill both those, then it's really not rigorous or useful science.  </p>
<p>Later on in history, people took these ideas and they changed the wording a bit, and the wording is a little bit complicated, but it's important, I think, to put on the table right now. the phrase is "analogy identifies anomaly." So the concept of analogy is that we as humans have an experiential base that we bring to anything that we are part of, and if we see something new, the first thing we do is compare it to something else we've seen or experienced, so that's the analogy. Now, in that experience, if through analogy from our experiences, we see something that doesn't fit, it's something new. It's something unexplained, then it's something that rises as something that's maybe concerning or startling or interesting, and something that should be identified as a topic of further investigation. So that's anomaly. So "analogy identifies anomaly" is a really important toolkit we have.  </p>
<p>The next person we want to look at, and again, this is a whirlwind tour, there are many others we can bring into play, but it's René Descartes, and he lived in 1596 to 1650 in France. He was a true renaissance man, a philosopher, mathematician, writer, but he wrote a book in 1637, on the Discourse on the Method, and in other words, what Descartes did was to bring the concepts of Socrates to the next level and say "If we have critical free thought "and we use our multiple senses, "um, in everything that we do in our everyday life, "then we can acquire knowledge "and have a genuine foundation of what's going on," but also, it's encapsulated in this great statement of "I think, therefore I am."  </p>
<p>And so he gave an example called the wax model, and I think that kind of explains where Descartes was bringing us. The wax model is the following: if you have a candle that's cool with a wick in the middle, let's say that some candle maker just made it, and you set the candle in a candle holder in front of you on the table and you describe it, you say "Oh, well it has a certain temperature, it has a color, it has a waxiness, it has a beautiful white wick, it has all these characteristics," but then if you light the candle and allow the candle to burn all the way down, you end up with something that's very different than what you started with, but it's still a candle, right? And so let's say that you let the candle burn all the way down, and you have this molten, gooey mass. the wick is now, if there's any wick left, it's black and it's, carbon, and it doesn't have the same color, it has none of the same shapes, but it's still is a candle.  </p>
<p>So therefore, the idea there is that we must utilize our multiple senses simultaneously all the time, but at those moments then, we have to understand the context of our observations.  </p>
<p>Another really important philosopher, and again, we're jumping through time here dramatically, is Tom Kuhn. he lived from 1922 to 1996, and Professor Kuhn was at Harvard and Berkeley and MIT and did a lot of very influential philosophical writings about science, but his most important, and I think profound work was the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which he published 1962. And so this builds upon what we've been talking about so far, but it adds another important caveat, and that is that the nature of humanity, you know, if scientists are humans and we bring to the table all the baggage that humans all have, one of the natures of science is that it's done by humans, and therefore, change is almost universally resisted.   </p>
<p>And so what Kuhn, puts forward is a look at the historical development of science and saying that, some of the most important things we've ever had, developed scientifically was a result of a lot of pain, a lot of struggle and a lot of rejection by society, and so the scientific revolutions he talks about is the idea that people will methodically, do scientific method or scientific inquiry, conduct research, have hypotheses tested, move forward with data, synthesize it, try to make predictions, try to put this into process models, but oftentimes the most important developments of this process is, actually rejected by, not only society, but other scientists. And then eventually, if the scientific work that's being rejected or shunned at some level, if it's strong, solid science and based in reproducibility and prediction, it finally prevails.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.3_Scientific_Inquiry_vs._Scientific_Method">1.3 Scientific Inquiry vs. Scientific Method</span></h1>
<p>So what we're going to do is put on the table a new modification. We do need to use a scientific, systematic approach, but that modified new version I'm going to call scientific inquiry. And it's the idea that we not only have to go through a systematic process, but it's a process that loops back on itself infinitely, and this infinite process of hypothesizing, testing, observing, synthesizing, but then taking those results and moving back to the point of saying, "What I've just learned "is that A, I know more about what I was investigating, "and B, I also know more about what I don't know … about what I was investigating." So we are always left ... excellent science is always bringing us to a new juncture of new possibilities for investigation, but also more information about what we were after. So it's that two-pronged approach, and standard scientific method does not accommodate that very well.  </p>
<p>So let me give you some examples. Scientific method is generally taught in what I call the cookbook approach. You could buy this... infinite wisdom cookbook, right, so you could have a very precise process that was laid out and understood by all scientists, and really the goal of the scientist was to simply and easily and systematically walk through that process from beginning to end and get some kind of scientific result that you could defend, that you could publish, that you could have into the, inserted into the, lexicon of society and science, and then you'd be successful.  </p>
<p>A good example is Yellowstone, where for many decades, centuries, people thought that Yellowstone and other places where water was really hot, heated by a volcano, coming to the surface, and they thought those waters were sterile and nothing lived in them. So, scientific method applied to a place like Yellowstone would say, the hypothesis is that life does live there, and you collect samples, you do experiments, and you end up with proving that life is there. Scientific method, as it's taught, it's a little deceiving, because it makes you think that well, the end game would be you've proven that life is there and you stop. The reality is that by continuing forward, by taking that idea that life lives in extreme environments and then asking the next question, and that's what we're defining, in this case, as scientific inquiry. It's going back with the results, both positive and negative results. You know, good science oftentimes yields information that isn't what you were looking for, and it yields information that has nothing to do with your original hypothesis, but that information is very valuable. And so scientific inquiry is simply that idea of saying the scientific method is valid, but you need to understand that scientific method is used repetitively in the cycle of inquiry, and you go back to these environments.  </p>
<p>So by going back to Yellowstone, we now know things like microbes can reproduce and, regenerate and recreate their-their DNA composition, by using a certain suite of chemicals, and those chemicals now are used fundamentally in human medicine all the time. The shortcoming of that is it only captures one part of how science is actually accomplished. Science requires going back over and over again to reevaluate what was concluded, to reevaluate the final results, but also to capture what wasn't known before. Good science usually brings to the table brand new ideas, insights you wouldn't have even asked before. It tells us what we don't know. It lets us explore things in a way, rigorously and thoughtfully, that identifies for us, "Well, we thought we knew how something worked, "but now we see that that one thing has four or five different manifestations "that come off of it."  </p>
<p>So the result of excellent science is to generate knowledge of a topic, but also to generate knowledge of what we don't know about this topic and related topics. So it's the concept of consistent spiraling, scientific inquiry that brings us back to, a process of investigating scientific questions. And let's go to a spiraling vortex, if you will, a tornado, and you're going to look right down the throat of the vortex into infinity. So you're going to view the process as a complete dynamic swirling entity, and I call that scientific inquiry.  </p>
<p>So let's just think a little bit about how that might play out. So number one is that, I'll use the word "initiation." So, originally you have an idea. Remember the thought of analogy identifies anomaly. In other words, we use our experiential past to compare to what we see at the present, and if what we see doesn't fit with what we know from the past, then it becomes anomalous, it becomes different, it becomes weird and it becomes of value to study.  </p>
<p>Then we initiate some thoughts about that and try to come up with a structured hypothesis, a prediction, if you will, of how what we see might have come into being, how it works or how it might be manifested, in the future.  </p>
<p>Then once we have that hypothesis from the initiation process, then I propose that, and again, this is all based on how I see really good science being done at the moment, we'd want to have some kind of pre-experimentation. Right, we want to run some simple logic experiments: is the hypothesis, is the context, is the initiation of the idea, is it valid and do we have some logic experiments we can run? And the beautiful thing about logic experiments is that they cost nothing, right, except a little bit of time and a little bit of concentrated effort.  </p>
<p>And then once we do the logic experiments, that things fit and they substantiate themselves, then we can move and maybe collect a little bit of data, put together a suite of analytical approaches, measurements, observations, photographs, use different simple tools and try to get some initial data. And then from that initial data observation-gathering, logic experiment technique, then you can start to have some results to let you test the hypothesis.  </p>
<p>Well, if after initiation and pre-experimentation you're, original ideas and hypotheses still stand the test, then I'd say that you can launch into true-scale experimentation. Now, why wait like this and why not just do the experiments at the beginning? Well, experiments that are done well cost a lot of time and money and effort, and, money and, money's usually the really big limiting factor here, because large-scale scientific endeavor requires significant, financial, support and input. So you want to be very careful once you- once you get funding to do, some kind of a serious study, you don't want to, if you will, fire those scientific bullets until you're ready to do so. You want to do the experimentation and you're willing to pay the money to do that, and the time and the effort, but you only want to do it when you know it's the highest probability of good results. So you finally then get to the point of actually doing the experimentation.  </p>
<p>Then you move to another really important stage I call that post-experimentation, the idea that once you get the full data sets together, you can synthesize them and make some hypotheses based on the initial data. You do modeling, which means that you combine the data, either logically or in computers, and you make interpretations and then predictions of what the results will mean, and then you substantiate and test directly the original hypothesis. Now, that stage of synthesis should never wait until after the experiment is over. Actually, it always needs to begin at some, moderate level, during the experimentation, so that you can always have a cross-check as you're running through the experiments to see if the data sets are coherent, if they're legitimate, if they're reproducible, and if they are actually getting to a point of answering the question.  </p>
<p>And then, this is the, riding the giant tornado. I call it reiterate and reinitiate, and that's where you take the results of your work to that point and you go back to the very beginning and you courageously, with vision and courage, look at the idea that you need to get back to the very beginning of your process, and are the results of your work A, fulfilling and testing adequately your hypothesis, and B, what are the other avenues and other uncertainties and other unknowns that the result of this process has given you?  </p>
<p>So the idea that you are constantly spinning, from initiation, logic experimentation, early pre-experimentation, full experimentation, synthesis and modeling throughout, and then heavily at the end, and then ending up with results that need to be reiterated, you're constantly spiraling forward. You are tightening the circle of the spiral, but you're still moving towards, an infinite truth that's in the middle of your process. So let's call that, that super-tornado of scientific endeavor, let's call that scientific inquiry, and that's the kind of process that evolutionary biology is built upon.  </p>
<p>That's the kind of process that all geoscience is built upon, and this marriage of evolutionary biology within the context of historical geology is all built upon this scientific inquiry approach.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.4_The_Scale_of_Time_and_Space:_Powers_of_Ten">1.4 The Scale of Time and Space: Powers of Ten</span></h1>
<p>As we approach a complex subject matter like the emergence of life, we are immediately faced with a hurdle, a conceptual concept that is really hard to get past because it's something we don't think about much in our daily lives, and that hurdle has to do with the concept of scale - how large or how small is something. And so the way that we want to approach scale in the Emergence of Life is to think about the dimensions of two very important properties. One of them is size, and one of them is time.  </p>
<p>So the properties of size we put into our category we call spatial, and so spatial dimensions - how large or how small is something. The spatial parameters are very important when we think about scale. The other concept of scale is time, and we use the word "temporal" for time, so temporal dimensions. So what we want to do now is "How do we approach extremely broad scales of spatial and temporal dimensions?" Of space, size, length, versus how long or how short an amount of time something, takes to actually function and come to its completion or fruition.  </p>
<p>So the way we do this in the Emergence of Life is that we have to recognize that our spatial and temporal frameworks are incredibly large. In our everyday life, obviously we use the human body as a good, comparative standard. We think about, say, a tree being three times as large as someone, or we think about children, being half or a third the size of an adult human being. So we always start by kind of comparing, and that comparison we just described, that's in this world of spatial dimensions, and understanding how big or how small something is.  </p>
<p>But when we look at the emergence of life, we are talking about looking at dimensions of length, length scales of spatial dimensions, that are incredibly small. The average diameter of a microorganism, especially bacteria, is about 1 micron. Well 1 micron is 1 millionth of a meter, and that one micron is one of the kind of functional units of spatial dimensions that we want to consistently be able to access and go to as we jump from 1 millionth of a meter to talk about human beings that are 1.5 to 2 meters in size, to talking about meteor impact craters that are 50 kilometers in size, right, and each kilometer, then, of course is 1,000 meters.  </p>
<p>So how do we, describe these kind of tremendous differences in size, when we want to go from a millionth or a billionth of something, all the way up to a thousand or a million or a billion times larger? We have the same kind of problem with the temporal concept of dimension. We want to recognize and look at the lifetime of a human being, on average 60, 70, 80, 90 years in length, but we also want to think about the time frame over which it takes a cell to divide, which in many cases it can be within seconds, or some of the basic chemical reactions, like when we breathe in oxygen, and then release CO2, those dimensions of time are in a fraction, a tiny proportion of a second. Then we go to the age of the Earth, 4.7 billion years. That's a tremendous increase over 1 second of time, so these are enormous distances, if you will, of scale.  </p>
<p>So how do we go about doing that for both space and time? And the way we do that is first of all, we consider a critical conceptual benchmark. We say to ourselves "Is something 10 times larger, or 10 times smaller? Is something 100 times larger, or 100 times smaller? Is something 1 million times larger, or 1 million times smaller?" But that first functional unit of saying, "Is something 10 times larger or 10 times smaller?", that is where we want to start with understanding how to look at the dimensions of time and space.  </p>
<p>And by centering it around that template of "Is something 10 times larger or 10 times smaller?" we call the approach The Powers of 10. If something is twice as large as something else, it catches our interest, but if something's 10 times larger than something else, it proves itself to be fundamentally important, fundamentally different, just because of the magnitude or size of that scale change. So the nice thing about The Powers of 10 approach and centering the idea around 10 times larger, 10 times smaller to start with is that then we can put the concept of describing length scales and time scales into a 10 by 10 by 10 basis. So we can say "Is something 10 times larger? Is it 100 times larger? Is it 1,000 times larger?"  </p>
<p>And if we go to the concept of something being 10 times larger, then if we put the framework of 10 into exponential notation, which goes to the point of saying that we put the number 10 and then we make a small exponent that tells us how many 0's come after that 10. Is it 10? Is it 100? Is it 1,000? 10 to the first is 10, 10 to the second is 100, and 10 to the third is 1,000. And by focusing on the exponent, instead of saying out all the 0's in terms of the number, like the word "1,000", then we can say that this microbial cell is 10 to the third larger than some of the molecules that make up the DNA of that microbial cell, then we can just drop off the 10 part of the description and we can focus just on the exponent, which is 3. So if something is 1,000 times larger than something else, then we say that that object is three powers of 10 greater. So something that is 10 times larger is one power of 10, something that's 100 times larger is two powers of 10, and so forth.  </p>
<p>And we go in the opposite direction. When something is two powers of 10 smaller than something else, that means it's 100 times smaller. So this powers of 10, conceptualization and framework is really powerful for us, and another phrase that we're going to be using throughout the Emergence of Life course is that we also say that one power of 10 is one order of magnitude. So something that's 10 times larger than something else is one power of 10 larger, and it's also-it can be described as one order of magnitude larger. let's say that the average child is 1 meter in height, and that we want to understand then how that child fits into the framework of a kilometer, right. So there are 1,000 meters in a kilometer, and so if we say well, that meter scale-let's say that they're standing next to the front range of a mountain, that's a kilometer in size, and there's a child that's 1 meter in height, then we would say that that mountain that the child is standing in front of, it's three powers of 10 larger than the child. It's 1,000 times larger than the child, and we can also say that it's three orders of magnitude larger than that child. And this concept of how to approach these immense diameters of scale of time and space are what will give us the ability to communicate, then, about going from the evolution of early cells all the way up through fish, dinosaurs, and now eventually human beings.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.5_NASA.27s_Greeting_Card_to_Aliens">1.5 NASA's Greeting Card to Aliens</span></h1>
<p>Imagine that you want to send a postcard throughout the universe, and you want to send a message to things that might or might not be alive. you have no idea what you're sending your postcard to, but you want to connect, in case, in the outer reaches of the universe, there are, say, microbes or maybe multicellular metazoans who evolved and perhaps made intelligent life.  </p>
<p>Well that was one of the major goals of NASA in the 1970s, early 1970s, to be able to send a postcard to anything that was alive in the universe and anything that could then read the postcard and get some information about where we are. And it was a really interesting experiment, not only in scientific endeavor, but also in human behavior, and that experiment was called the golden record. And the golden record, is actually still hurtling outward in space on the Voyager spacecraft. So the golden record was a small record made of solid gold, thin, on a scale of a millimeter or so in thickness, and it ended up being a postcard, or in this case a record, on which a lot of information was burned about what life is like on planet Earth, and the fact that life exists on Earth.  </p>
<p>NASA put together a lot of scientists, a lot of philosophers, and a lot of social scientists, who worked on this idea of what should our postcard contain that we send out to the unknown, intelligent life throughout the universe. And so it was chosen to be put on a piece of gold because of the fact that gold resists many types of cosmic radiation. It also resists very well certain chemical attacks that could happen as it was hurtling out in space. So gold was a good choice.  </p>
<p>Now, when an interesting idea is if we were to send a new version of the golden record out into space instead of the early '70s, what would we put it on? Would we put it on a DVD? Would we put it on some kind of high-speed tape of some type? You know, what would be the format? So the format of gold was chosen because it's resistant. Now, we have the spacecraft that's going to go out, and it's still proceeding outward and past, Pluto, and it's now to the farthest reaches of our universe and continuing. So the next question is what should we put on the record? And this is the fascinating part.  </p>
<p>So through a whole series of meetings that took place over many, many years, NASA decided on the following, that one of the things on the golden record should be some etchings that occur on the face of the record. You know how if you go to a music store and you buy a DVD, or for some of us, the old vinyl LP's in the past, and one of the things that really attracts you, right, is the cover of the record, what's the label. And so NASA thought "Well, let's make a label etched onto the cover of the gold that's going to be attractive, but also meaningful.  </p>
<p>So on that label they put a couple things. One of the graphic designs, the objects they etched onto that, is the structure of the hydrogen atom, and so the idea that there's a nucleus and electrons that float around it. That's a pretty good idea, right?  </p>
<p>Another, concept was, "Well, let's see, we better put on the cover of the record how to build a record player," and so if you look at the front face of the golden record, it has a design that something could read and actually build a record player to be able to play the golden record.  </p>
<p>Then another thing that was pretty important, depends on how you look at this actually, is, where Earth is positioned within the universe. So where are we located, and what's the basic element, and then how do you make the record player.  </p>
<p>Now, for those of us in, I'm assuming that some of you are in this same camp, who love science fiction, if we think about some of the most recent movies, or even the most dramatically memorable movies, things like or or some of these movies, it might be argued that it's not such a good idea to send a postcard with an exact location of where you're sending the postcard from, right? So inviting something to Earth that might blow us away might not be the best strategy, but you know, we think that we're not … if we do find intelligent life, hopefully they're not going to be aggressive to that level.  </p>
<p>So, hydrogen atom, how to build the record player, and then the position of Earth within the solar system on a quasar map. So that's what's on the LP, and we're hoping that that LP will really attract the alien visitors to the record store, and they'll want to make a record player.  </p>
<p>Then the next question is what's going to go on the record, and so, NASA decided, again through many, many meetings over several years, there are three basic things that should be on the record. One thing on the record should be an assortment of photographs, okay, so pictures of planet Earth. What are some of the different components of Earth? Life, water. What are all the components of Earth that you'd want to have on a series of pictures? And you can't have many because in the early 70s and given it's a golden record, you can only hold a few images. So what would you pick to have on that? So we'll go to that in just a moment.  </p>
<p>The next thing that they thought would be important would be to have sounds on the record, and those sounds are indicative of what life is like on the planet, and we'll speak about that in just a minute. And so this combination of photographs and sounds, was kind of the template that they wanted to have the record portray to whatever life form would be able to play it. Well, that sounds okay too, but there's a few things about it.  </p>
<p>There's one more thing in addition to sounds that they wanted to have, not only sounds of what life is like, but also the sound specifically of human beings, and so one of the third components on the record is languages. And so, very interesting, this reflected kind of the geographic, political, dynamics of the planet in that time period of the Cold War, but they chose a selection of languages to have on the golden record as well.  </p>
<p>So again, this all sounds good, but let's think about a little bit what they chose. So the pictures they chose - kind of interesting. There's a picture, of a person eating melting ice cream. That's, I guess, interesting. There's a picture of a person drinking. There's a picture of an airplane taking off from JFK airport. There's a picture of a lake and a mountain and some animals around it. But then there are some line drawings of things like a human fetus.  </p>
<p>So it's kind of interesting this array of pictures they decided, and you know, that's an interesting question to all of us. If we were the ones making the picture postcard to send to unknown aliens, what would we pick? So that's what was chosen at that moment.  </p>
<p>Then in terms of sounds, another interesting series of choices were made. One of the first sounds you hear on the golden record is the sound of a horse-drawn cart moving down a cobblestone street you know, the clip-clop- clip-clop, and then you hear the wagon wheels turning. It's an interesting sound, definitely, but you know, it's unique that they would pick that as part of one of the few sounds they'd pick. Another type of sound is they have the sound of water flowing. They have the sound of a machine running. There's all kinds of sounds, but not necessarily maybe the sounds that you or I would pick for the postcard.  </p>
<p>Then the last piece of the puzzle was the languages, and again, this reflects strongly the geopolitical concepts in the age of the cold war. So the languages they chose were, of course, English, and for each of the languages, they have a map on there that shows where the language was generated from. So there's a-I think it was in the Midwest, and there's language of English. Hello from the children of planet Earth. Then, of course, they have a couple languages in Europe. I believe there's one in Sweden and then there's one in southern Europe. And there's German, and then they keep going, and then you keep seeing, wow! There's Spanish in there, and the Spanish comes from South America. But then you just keep looking across the globe. There's, Chinese, there's Russian, there's Japanese.  </p>
<p>So a little known fact is that Carl Sagan was in charge of putting all the images, sounds and music on the golden record. One of his fellow scientists was Ann Druyan, and he actually put her in charge of the sounds of Earth, and while she was trying to think of different sounds to put on the record, she thought it would be really cool to put someone's EEG on the record, or their brainwaves, and so she was hoping that by putting the brainwaves on the record that there could be some intelligent life out there that could actually have some technology to decipher the brainwaves and actually interpret and understand human thought. So that was her idea.  </p>
<p>So they only had 6 months to compile everything on the golden record, and she worked very closely with Carl Sagan, and during that time, working late nights together, they fell in love. So the day that she actually did her brainwaves to record them, Carl Sagan called her and was talking about how great this project is and how it's going to change your life, and so he decided to change her life even more - he asked her to marry him. And so, elated and excited and happy about getting married to Carl Sagan, she actually went in and recorded her brain waves - not of thoughts of human history or of our culture or philosophy, but actually of love, of true love. So that is actually one of the messages we sent out to space.  </p>
<p>So we've made an attempt to reach out to other unknown aliens in the universe, and what we're after is some universal principles that can tie together this idea that life and its Earth conditions, or life and its planetary conditions have been able to evolve and co-evolve, and that process doesn't have to happen on planet Earth; it can take place on other planets as well. And the golden record was an achievement to put out this postcard of greetings to unknown products of evolutionary biology on other planets as a way to signal kind of the birth of evolutionary biology, strongly impacting the space program and then other aspects of how we interact with and perceive our own planet.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.6_Deep_Geological_Time">1.6 Deep Geological Time</span></h1>
<p>Geological time is a critical central framework with which to discuss the emergence of life on Earth and potentially other planets. It gives us a framework, a reference with which to guide the progression through deep geological time, and what we want to do is take a moment to understand what that progression is composed of, what the framework of geological time is hinged upon, and then what some of the benchmarks are of geological time that we want to use to develop the emergence of life concept around.  </p>
<p>So let's start off with the birth of the Earth at about 4.7 billion years ago. That seems like a long time in human context, but in terms of geological context, that's not that long ago. The universe itself is thought to be over 15 billion years old, so 4.7 billion, that's only a third of the history of the entire universe.  </p>
<p>Now, that early Earth, it was composed of rock and dust and gasses and other materials that have been floating and accelerating through the universe, after the initial Big Bang eruption of the planet, of the universe, and the planet congealed together, it accumulated, and originally it was small lumps of dust and rock and and ice, and then that came together to become what we call a planetesimal, and then that planetesimals kept growing larger and larger and then we became actually a large-scale planet, and at that stage then, the Earth started having very specific chemical and physical properties.  </p>
<p>The Earth started cooling, and originally was very hot and began the cooling process, and then the Earth differentiated into pieces with a core, a mantel and a crust. Now, once that process of having an Earth be formed had been initiated, then we can go through the stages of Earth progression.  </p>
<p>So in this earliest time period, that we call the Archaean, that goes from about 4.7 to 2.5 billion years before present, at about 4.2 billion, or something in that kind of range, the Earth was hit by another large, planetesimals body, about the size of Mars, and it slammed into the planet, and the result of that was it reset the cooling evolution of the planet, but it also in the end then formed the moon. And so setting up a planet with the moon and the gravitational forces and influences that the moon has, then that was another major benchmark in the history of the planet.  </p>
<p>Then still within the Archaean, we think that at about 4 or 3.9 billion years, the Earth went through a process of having a reduced number of meteor bombardments, and life itself got a foothold. So, in that early range, we have chemical evidence of early life, and then we also have some fossils that were found of small, microbial cells that were trapped within terrestrial, or perhaps submarine, hot spring deposits, places on the planet where water is coming out of the Earth heated and flow and precipitate minerals very quickly, and they trap any microbes that might have been there. So 3.7 billion is when we have fairly firm evidence both again from this fossil and the chemical fingerprints of life, that life had gotten a foothold on our planet by that time.  </p>
<p>Now, that early life, was primarily bacteria, but archaea would have been part of it, and we now know too, that eukarya, the third branch of life that we've been discussing, that that also had a foothold at this kind of early time.  </p>
<p>Now, at 2.5 billion, that's a benchmark because that's when the Earth became oxygenated, and each time we take a deep breath and breathe oxygen, we need to remember that that oxygen was derived from early bacteria that actually evolved photosynthesis. So if you say the word photosynthesis, the process of combining sunlight and CO2 to create sugars and oxygen, we usually think of plants, but that process was actually developed and structured originally by the bacteria. So by 2.5 billion, enough bacteria had risen on the planet, which originally had no oxygen, to driving the planet to an oxygenated state, plenty of free oxygen that was around in both the atmosphere and the oceans. So the end of the Archaea is at 2.5 billion.  </p>
<p>Then we move into the Proterozoic. The Proterozoic ran from about 2.5 billion to about 542 million, so half a billion to 2.5 billion, so another full 2 billion years of Earth history took place in that time period. And the combination of the Archaean and the Proterozoic, we call that the Precambrian. So the Proterozoic is a benchmark for us because that was the age of having an oxygenated planet. We still had relatively simple cells. They weren't multicellular eukarya, but instead they were single cells that were primarily operating, and that's when we had the proliferation of things like bacterial mats that grew on the sea floor, and many of these mats could photosynthesize.  </p>
<p>Another benchmark at the end of the Proterozoic was that the Earth froze. There were multiple processes that kicked into play, and the entire Earth became frozen. We call that snowball Earth, but then quickly the snowball Earth ended at about 600 million years before present, and then into the Cambrian explosion at 542 million years before present.  </p>
<p>Then, as we move forward then from the Precambrian, which is the Archaean and the Proterozoic combined, at 542 moving up to 251 million years before present, we call that the Paleozoic, and the Paleozoic was really this proliferation of multi-celled organisms called eukarya, and then the beginning of that process were eukarya that could actually form a skeleton. The early skeletons were all external, and then eventually we had skeletons that formed internally, and we move from invertebrates (the external skeletons) to vertebrates (the internal skeletons).  </p>
<p>Now, in this time period, going from the Cambrian explosion at 541 million up into the modern, we call that the Phanerozoic, and that Phanerozoic is broken into this early Paleozoic sequence, which ends at 251 million years, and that is a benchmark event, again, in Earth history. It is caused by a massive meteor impact that caused, global extinction, death of many types of organisms that are alive. The estimates are that about 85% of what was living went extinct at that time period.  </p>
<p>As we pass through this extinction event due to a meteor impact, the next geological time period is called the Mesozoic, and the Mesozoic ran from about 251 million to about 65 million years before present. That 65 million year time period, event time, is a benchmark because it was caused by another meteor impact. At that time, the meteor impact was one of the major, causes of the extinction of the dinosaurs. So the Mesozoic, the middle kind of time period, is a benchmark event in Earth history, and it's marked by the death of the dinosaurs.  </p>
<p>Then as we keep moving forward into the latter part of the Phanerozoic, we call that the Cenozoic, and the Cenozoic runs from the meteor impact extinction event at 65 million years up into the modern. And so that Cenozoic time period is really the proliferation and development of what we know of as mammals and birds and all of the more recent generations of organisms that were evolving and forming on planet Earth.  </p>
<p>The lower part of the Cenozoic is called the Paleogene; the upper part is called the Neogene, and they represent again this transition of the Earth going from the end of the rule of the dinosaurs and a continually evolving planet that is much more like the modern than anything we'd seen earlier in geological history.  </p>
<p>So overall, this is a need-to-know framework of geological history-the Precambrian, the Archaean and the Proterozoic, the Phanerozoic, composed of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic. These are the great time periods of geological history in which we see the the emergence of life taking place, and this will create the framework for the rest of the course.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.7_The_Structure_of_the_Solar_System">1.7 The Structure of the Solar System</span></h1>
<p>The structure of the universe lays a roadmap and a template for us to think about how life has evolved. Life itself is made out of the same stardust that everything else is made out of, and so it's part of a continuum, and therefore one without the other you can't really understand the context of the structure of life and the history of life.  </p>
<p>So, let's just visit briefly what we know about our solar system and how the structure has come to be. The first thing is that we know that there's a good recent TV show called "The Third Rock from the Sun," and so we do live on the third rock, but as we look at the structure in the universe, we now have eight planets, instead of nine. Poor Pluto was the last planet. It was kicked off the list because it wasn't big and bad and tough and in the right orbit enough to remain as a planet.  </p>
<p>So we have eight planets, and the way that we view that universal solar system structure is pretty simple. It's broken into a couple parts. One, we have a series of four planets that are the closest to the sun, and we call those the terrestrial, or rocky planets, and those planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and a very well-known planet, Mars. So the inner terrestrial rocky planets, and they call them that because they are hard, they're solid, they're rocky, and they're relatively small compared to the other planets.  </p>
<p>Then, the other group of planets that go outward from there, the other four planets, we call them the giant gas planets, or the Jovian planets, and these are significantly larger, many times larger than the inner rocky planets, and they have an inner rock, metal core in the center, but the vast majority of the planets are all of these circulating seas, if you will, of gases that are swirling and rotating around this very relatively small core. And the ones that make up that group are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Again, Pluto has been knocked off the list, but I will say that there are some suggestions that that should be reconsidered, but we won't go to that discussion at this point.  </p>
<p>In addition to these eight planets, we have a grouping of rock, dust, and ice and garbage debris, if you will, old kinds of particles and chunks and rock fragments that never made it into a planet, but are still moving around throughout the solar system. So the three I want to talk about that are important because they also speak to this idea that they are the source areas for the meteors that end up hitting the Earth and causing mass extinctions and great destruction.  </p>
<p>The first one is called the asteroid belt. So the terminology here is that when a body is moving through space, we call that a meteor, and meteors can be composed of two types. One is composed of solid rock, and we call that an asteroid. One is composed of primarily ice and then rock fragments, and that's called a comet.  </p>
<p>So the asteroid belt is, again, primarily formed of these very large, pieces of rock that are whirling through the universe, and the asteroid belt is just to the outside of Mars, and this speaks to the idea that through history Mars has been a lot less lucky than Earth has been, and lucky in respect to how many times meteors have pulverized and hit the planet. We've had plenty on Earth, but we've had a lot more on Mars, and one of the reason Mars currently is a cold, desolate place with, we hope the potential for life in the subsurface, is because, simply put, they were bombarded with meteors that came in from the asteroid belt.  </p>
<p>Another really important grouping of bodies in the universe and the solar system we call it the Kuiper belt, and Kuiper was the name of the scientist who identified these originally. And this is a group of comets, again, the water and rock debris chunks that are flying through the universe, and those occur just beyond Neptune. So we have the asteroid belt serving up Earth and Mars and other planets with plenty of asteroids, and the Kuiper belt serving up comets.  </p>
<p>And then the last one, is, another group of comets that we call the Oort cloud, and the Oort cloud is at the very most outer reaches of our solar system. and so these three belts, the asteroid belt, the Kuiper belt, and the Oort cloud are sourcing primarily the groupings of asteroids and comets that then end up slamming into planet Earth. Now, another thing to think about is that the advent of the Hubble telescope, the incredible, telescope that is now in space, in orbit around the planet. By focusing the Hubble telescope at some of the farthest reaches of the solar system that we can see from Earth's orbit, we have a brand new appreciation of what the structure of the universe is, but one of those is just simply how amazing the number of stars are, and then in concert to that is how many planets could be around those stars.  </p>
<p>So right now, our current sun in our solar system is one of only 300 billion stars. So 300 billion, and that's in the Milky Way alone, and then with the findings of the Hubble telescope, we now know that there are many orders of magnitude, many, many more solar systems that have not even been mapped throughout the universe. So the Milky Way is one of hundreds of hundreds of billions of galaxies and solar systems that are just visible, and then there's a whole other suite of these that we can't see yet. So, the idea is that our solar system, as amazing and complex and dynamic as it is just one tiny, fleck or sliver of the total number that are out there.  </p>
<p>So this structure of our solar system: the rocky planets, the Jovian gas giants, and then having an asteroid belt, a Kuiper belt, and an Oort cloud, that's the structure then, that's the dynamic that is allowing us to have, through geological time and it'll happen again in the future, regular bombardment of the Earth by meteors. And when a rock body, an asteroid or a comet, is flying through the universe, we call that a meteor, but then when it slams into a planet, or in our case slams into the Earth, we then call that a meteorite.  </p>
<p>So the meteorites that we find on Earth have given us a lot of information about the solar system and that's another piece of evidence that we have to know the structure, of our planetary system. And then this sets the stage then to understand why we've had, through geological time, so many impacts on the planet from these meteors, and then the segue from that is to recognize that the structure of Earth history and the structure of geological time is actually formulated around the series of meteor impacts that have taken place, and the reason for that is that most of Earth history is broken up and structured according to the history of life and the paleontological fossil record of what we see on the planet. So this particular Earth structure- universal structure, we've seen, then that's what allows that structural component of how time is carved up between, primarily, meteor impacts.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.8_Birth_of_the_Earth">1.8 Birth of the Earth</span></h1>
<p>So let's take a look quickly at the history of how our universe came to be as a template for looking at evolutionary biology. All matter in the universe was all compressed into one small point, and that small point exploded with a force that we cannot imagine, and that explosion we call the Big Bang. Now, it's possible that we had multiple Big Bangs, but the most recent Big Bang, that generated the universe that we're part of, started at about 15.5 billion years ago.  </p>
<p>So approximately 15 billion years is the jump start for the modern day universe as we know it. Now, if that Big Bang theory is correct, and it is being modified and thoroughly studied by many people right now, so our hypothesis of how the Big Bang operates is constantly in flux, but if that did take place, then the universe consisted of a chaotic, swirling cloud of hydrogen and helium, these very essential elements that we call a nebula. Then, as the hydrogen and helium nebula was spinning, it was full of a huge amount of heat, it went through an ongoing process of rotation and heat loss, and as it rotated, the rotating mass of gas and essential elements were transformed into a spinning disc, and in the middle of that spinning disc there was a center bulbous area that we call a nebula, and that bulbous nebula, continued to collapse inward on itself, drawing in matter from the rest of this immense distribution of gas and elements.  </p>
<p>Well, in the middle of that nebula, eventually there became a condensed, very tightly-woven ball, if you will, of hydrogen atoms that were colliding and fusing together to create more elements. So we started off with just the basic element hydrogen, and then helium, and then we moved to a condition where those elements were being compressed on themselves and fusing, and that nuclear fusion then is what generated all the rest of the elements that we know of in our solar system.  </p>
<p>So that initial nebula, then, kept compressing and generating, through nuclear fusion, all these elements, and then it formed a sun. So this is the general concept of how then that sun is a body of very condensed gases and elements, and it radiates heat and light, and then the solar system then forms around that as the sun, nebula center, continues to evolve. So this is kind of the basic template, then, to end up with, a central star that has a lot of material, elemental material, that's spinning around it, that can then evolve to the next step of actually having a star with planets around it.  </p>
<p>So one of the most famous, and important examples of this is what we call the Eagle Nebula, and the Eagle Nebula was photographed by the Hubble telescope, illustrating the synthesis of stars, through this nebulous spinning disc rotational process. So once we got a structure of a star going through nuclear fusion, and then having all this material swirling around it, that material continued to cool, and it also collided with each other, and as you had very small elements, and they would start to fuse and come together, then they would stick together and form larger and larger masses of rock material.  </p>
<p>So in this cooling, spinning process that's around the stars, then that material would accrete together and merge to form what we call planetesimals. Planetesimals are these early types of coagulated groupings of matter that are eventually then going to be turning into planets themselves. Well the planetesimals continued to collide, they merge over and over again through this rotational process, and then we end up with, a true planet. Now, the outer planets, in addition to having this kind of dense, rocky core that was from this accretion in the spinning, around the star, the outer planets also, accumulated very huge amounts of gas, so that's why we have the structure of the inner four planets are rocky, the outer four planets are gaseous giants with a rocky core in them.  </p>
<p>So in this process, then we finally establish a sun with a rotating series of planets around them, and then we have a lot of material that has not been accreted together to actually form a planetesimal or form a planet. Then at that point, then the solar system and Earth itself began to take on a structure that is not that dissimilar from what we see in the modern day.  </p>
<p>So this model of a stepwise progression from individual materials that group together, and then to form larger materials called planets that puts into place then the idea of the structure of the inner and the outer planets.  </p>
<p>Now, at that same time, planet Earth itself was going through a very strong series of changes, and when you first accrete together these individual fragments of ash and dust and smaller particles that group together, they began to heat, and they become compressed, and when they do that, then that process drives what we've called the differentiation, or the structural genesis of the Earth.  </p>
<p>The modern day Earth has a solid, and brittle crust that's on the outside. Then we have a very large component within the Earth, that's composed of molten rock; we call it the mantel. And then within the core of the Earth, we have a solid core and a liquid core. So the Earth's structure, of having a crust, a mantle and a core, that was all established in this early time period as well. So this idea of accreting smaller particles into larger particles, having those large particles form planets, and then having that material become dense and hot, when you get the large accretions of these into a planet-sized object - one of the results is that you have chemical transformations but also physical transformations that make the center of the planet hot, and then the heat is being dispersed outward from that.  </p>
<p>Now, one of the next questions is "Well, how do you make things round?" And the roundness of these accreted planetary bodies is caused by their spinning rotations that go through the solar system. So not only just the mo-motion through the solar system, but actually the spin of the planet itself, and in the end this makes a spherical body. Now, the Earth is not perfectly spherical - no planet is perfectly spherical - but for most practical purposes, looking at it as a sphere is a pretty useful model. . It's actually e-ellipsoidal in shape, because of the stresses that are put onto the planet as it's rotating and spinning.  </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="1.9_The_Perfect_Storm:_A_Recipe_for_Life">1.9 The Perfect Storm: A Recipe for Life</span></h1>
<p>I don't know if you've thought about this, but on a daily basis when I look up at the sky or get up and see what's going on around me, I'm constantly amazed at the combination of events that have actually come together to allow our everyday life to be as it is. Planet Earth was a very difficult place. In fact, it was an impossible place for organisms like ourselves to live in for the vast majority of Earth history. But then, as Earth and life evolved together, the planet changed, and the whole idea that life could even get a foothold on planet Earth is a truly remarkable combination of events, and one of the best ways to describe this is really this phrase, "the perfect storm."  </p>
<p>There were many things that came together that were unexpected and quite rare and unique, but all these factors came together to allow a window of opportunity for life to begin and initiate in planet Earth.  </p>
<p>So I'd like to run through what this perfect storm is, and perfect storm, in this case, is actually positive, right? It's like a combination of events that allowed a remarkable thing to happen, which is the genesis and synthesis of life on planet Earth. So, when Earth was first being formed, it was coming together as a combination of rock and dust and water that was cooling out of small particles that were swirling through the universe. And so, it was a very dynamic process of matter coming together within the universe.  </p>
<p>Well soon after that, we had a collision, and it created through time, again, this dust, this water, these rock particles that coalesced, stuck together and made the moon. And so the moon was actually a product of meteor impact on the early Earth. Well in that stage, then, of the Earth then recovering from that impact, then the Earth slowly went through cooling and chemical changes, and some of those chemical changes were profound.  </p>
<p>Now, one of those major changes that took place was the core of the Earth was formed, and again, in that core we had an inner core that was solid and an outer core. Those bodies of material that were molten and solid, they would rotate past each other constantly, and they're metallic, and so that rotation actually generated the Earth's magnetic field. Now, we're going to all this detail because of the fact that we needed to have a magnetic field to protect the outer crust of the Earth and the surface of the Earth from incoming, cosmic rays that were generated by the sun, ultraviolet radiation among others.  </p>
<p>And so until the Earth had generated its magnetic field which, if you will, acts as a safety umbrella to protect the Earth from this incoming cosmic radiation, the Earth's crust, the outer part of the crust, could not sustain life. So at just the right series of events, again, the Earth cooled, differentiated, went through chemical changes, and established this protective umbrella called the Earth's magnetic field, and that protected the outer surface from the cosmic radiation. But also, at the same time, the early Earth had been bombarded very heavily by meteors, these incoming bodies of rock and ice that come in from outer space and slam into the planet. And the frequency at which that happened was dramatic; it was very high.  </p>
<p>Now, the Earth and Mars were not so dissimilar in that they both were planets, now we know, with water on the surface and they had atmospheres, but Mars got unlucky compared to Earth, and Mars simply had many more meteor impacts that lasted a lot longer, and we call that the period of heavy early bombardment. Well the Earth got lucky. The early bombardment, it was intense at first and then it died off, and it got to be, in a relative sense, very low-frequency, the number of times it was hit. And so at the same time the Earth's magnetic field was set up to protect us from radiation, also the frequency and the number of meteor bombardments decreased at just the right time.  </p>
<p>There are some hypotheses that suggest that during the early stages of early bombardment, when we did have a magnetic field, that, Earth tried to get a foothold in terms of life, and life couldn't do it. And it wasn't because of the radiation; it was because it was basically blasted to pieces by these incoming meteors. But as soon as you decrease the frequency of meteor impacts and you have your safety shield up, then life can get a foothold. That was also the early Earth environment where we had no oxygen, it was a very sulfur-rich environment, which sulfur to us is toxic, but oxygen to these early organisms was equally toxic as sulfur is to us.   </p>
<p>And this whole confluence of dramatic circumstance came together to create an ability to have life start and survive on the outer crust of the Earth. So that's how we need to see the initial kick start, the template for the evolutionary biology of planet Earth, is that the Earth configured itself perfectly, in the perfect storm, to allow the genesis of life and then the radiation of life across the planet.</p>
