<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="5.1_Plants_Invade_the_Land_and_Sea">5.1 Plants Invade the Land and Sea</span></h1>
<p>So let's dive into plants now! So we have some theories about how the Cambrian explosion could have arisen, or, you know, we've questioned that a little bit, but now we want to talk about these early plants and how those developed. So we're going to start with our red algae. We've a fine specimen here, of red algae, here we are. And this, as you can tell, it has a robust calcium carbonate, "skeleton," if you will, so it has this is all calcium carbonate, and what it allows this organism to do is live in a high-energy environment. So what high energy refers to is a lot of wave action, actually. And so if you have the development of this robust skeleton, you can withstand that wave action and persist in those kind of harsh environments. </p>
<p>So the next early plant that we'd like to look at is the green algae. Alright, a nice specimen there! Alright, so green algae, so this is still calcium carbonate, and so you can identify the skeletons by these little delicate kind of leafy-like calcium carbonate precipitations. And so I mentioned that these are much more delicate. We've got to be careful when handling this fossil or this specimen here. And so what you can deduce from that information is that they actually have to live in a little bit more quiet, less energetic environment such as a lagoon, or kind of that back lagoon area. So, why we are interested in the green algae here is that these are thought to be a precursor to our land plants, which we'll get into in just a minute. </p>
<p>Next is our brown algae, I know, algae's exciting, isn't it? Well actually I think brow-brown algae is exciting, because these are your large kelp, actually, so these are multicellular algae, and you get these huge kelp forests that I think are pretty fascinating. It's just algae in these huge structures here. So that's our brown algae. </p>
<p>Next are our diatoms. So still these are early plants, and these are algae that actually precipitate silica shells instead of these calcium carbonate skeletons. So diatoms actually have a silica shell, boy, they're just beautiful actually, and they have these really kind of geometric shapes. They're  very symmetrical. They're gorgeous! They're gorgeous, these diatoms. And these actually comprise phytoplankton actually. So I mentioned with the green algae that they may have been the precursors to land plants. </p>
<p>So we want to consider what the process would have been to transfer from the aquatic environment to the terrestrial environment for plants. So first of all you would need a support system, the organisms would need support, and that's in the form of stems. So stems provide support in the land environment, or the terrestrial environment, whereas in the water, the water itself actually supports that organism, and so we kind of need that translation from water to land, and the first step is we need a support system. </p>
<p>Secondly, roots allow for anchorage of that organism, and they also allow the uptake of water and nutrients. So roots are going to anchor that plant in position there. </p>
<p>Next we have the development of a waxy cuticle, so kind of a waxy surface there, or a covering of that plant, and that basically prevents too much water loss. So if you're on land in the terrestrial environment, you're exposed to air, and so you may have a little bit increased water loss, and that waxy cuticle prevents that process. </p>
<p>Last, we have the development of vascular tissue. You have vascular tissue, and so do plants! And so do land plants, I should say. So vascular tissue allows the circulation of water and nutrients throughout the whole organism. So you have xylem and phloem. Hmm, sounds like a good name for a pair of fish or something-Xylem and Phloem. But the xylem tissue, so you can kind of think of these as like longitudinal tubes sort of running up the length of a plant. And so xylem allows for water transport, and phloem allows for nutrient transport.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="5.2_Early_Prevascular_Plants">5.2 Early Prevascular Plants</span></h1>
<p>So there's two types of plants, the nonvascular plants and the vascular plants. So we're obviously referring to the presence or absence of that vascular tissue, the xylem and phloem. So nonvascular plants have no vascular tissue, and these are called bryophytes. So these are generally kind of small, and because they have no real method to transport water, so the absence of that vascular tissue constrains them to a certain size, and that is being rather small here. So examples of your bryophytes are mosses and liverworts. So they're almost kind of like ground-cover plants here. </p>
<p>So the other type of plant, in contrast, are your vascular plants, and these have developed that vascular tissue, and these are called tracheophytes. So examples of those are ferns and trees. So let's go into detail in the life cycle of plants, pretty exciting! Alright. No, no, it is exciting. So plants have alternating generations or stages, so they alternate between these two different stages. So the two stages are the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage. So the gametophyte stage is where you actually have sexual generation. So in this stage the plant is producing gametes that basically combine and form the sporophyte phase. So the sporophyte phase is the asexual generation stage, or the asexual generation. And this is considered kind of the parent generation, if you will. So the sporophyte phase is the dominant stage in tracheophytes, your vascular plants, and the gametophyte stage is the dominant phase in the bryophytes, your non-vascular plants. So just to kind of help you relate to something you might see in your own environment, in flowering plants the sporophyte is the entire organism, excluding the pollen and the embryo sack. </p>
<p>So next we want to consider, um, sort of the reproductive strategy. Alright, so we're talking about spores and seeds, spores and seeds. So spores are dispersal units that lack kind of a packet. A dispersal unit that lacks nutrient resources that are provided in a packet, so it's lacking that function. Seeds are dispersal units that actually store nutrients that are encased in a seed coat. So this is a little bit similar to the amniotic egg where we have the placenta providing nutrients to the fetus. Actually a seed has that protective packet, and it provides nutrients for that seed while it's blowing in the wind or awaiting its arrival. </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="5.3_Takeover_of_the_Vascular_Plants">5.3 Takeover of the Vascular Plants</span></h1>
<p>So Earth's tracheophytes are the first land plants that may have arisen in the early Silurian. And these would resemble kind of filamentous, green algae here, our early tracheophytes. An early forest would not have appeared until the Devonian. So within Earth's tracheophytes, we have three different flora. We're going to define those stages of Earth's flora: I, II and III. </p>
<p>So within Flora I, our first type of plant that we'd like to introduce to you here, maybe you've already seen these, these are your ferns. So this is a wonderful impression of a fern, and the technical term used to refer to ferns is pteropsida, and that means "true fern." And so these were most diverse in the Paleozoic and have declined since then, definitely still around today, and they have notable spore pods on the back of the leaves there. I'd like to show you another example of a carbonized fern. And so you can see it has kind of this blackened area, and that's basically all the organic material has been pressurized into just kind of a black smudge, honestly, just the presence of carbon there. </p>
<p>Alright, moving on, our next plant in Flora I are the lycopods, and these are club mosses, kind of a low-growing plant that lacks seeds, but they do have notable leaf scars on their stems. But what's interesting, to me, kind of my imagination, I suppose, is that these lycopods actually grew to 30 meters high, and during the Paleozoic we actually had trees of these lycopods, and with these huge stems and these leaf scars. So we do have evidence of that actually; alright, that's what we need, evidence, right? And so evidence of that is a specimen such as this. This is actually a smaller little example here, a smaller specimen, but you can actually see here kind of the cross-hatching of this lepidodendron stem. </p>
<p>So the term lepidodendron refers to a fossil of the stems, okay, that's something to note, of the stems only, of these club mosses that were successful during the Paleozoic. Okay, and something I want to kind of contrast this stem fossil to is the fossilization of the roots of this plant. So here we have a lovely cast, and what you can see here is you actually can see these root hairs, kind of the scars of the root hairs on this plant fossil, and the term stigmaria is the name that has been applied to the fossils of these roots of these club mosses, of these lycopods. </p>
<p>And so that's an example of form taxa. So form taxa, again, to reiterate, is just where you have a couple different types of fossils here that you find, and scientists actually have named them two different names expecting that they're two different organisms, and later we put them together in kind of a model, and we recognize that these are actually two different parts of the same organism. So this is a great example of form taxa, our lepidodendron and our stigmaria that both represent a lycopod in the Paleozoic. </p>
<p>And one more thing we want to note about the lycopods is that they were definitely dominant and just wildly successful during the Pennsylvanian, and the Pennsylvanian forest decomposition has resulted in those swamps, not only the forests, but the swamps as well, and the decomposition of those organisms comprises much of the world's coal, actually, so a lot of organic material there being fossilized and eventually pressurized into coal, which again, is a chemical fossil. Coal is a chemical fossil, just to review. </p>
<p>Continuing on with Flora I, the next group of organisms or plants are the sphenopsids, and these are your horsetails. So again, these horsetails grew to large sizes during the Paleozoic, but definitely a little bit smaller organism that persists today. And these are characterized by leaves that radiate outward in whorls, actually, around the stem, and the whorls are kind of separated by these jointed stems. So we have a couple of great fossils here, another example of form taxa. So the leaves of these sphenopsids were termed annularia, that's the name that this particular organism was assigned when this fossil was discovered. So annularia here, and if you can imagine, these leaves would be rotating outward in these whorls around the stems. The actual stems, we have some great fossils here, the stems of these sphenopsids were also fossilized, but they were named something different; they were identified as a different organism when they were first discovered! So the stems are termed calamites. So we have annularia and calamites, and those both comprise the sphenopsids. </p>
<p>On the calamites fossil, you can see really clearly where the whorls of leaves would have attached, and so you can see we kind of have these jointed stems going upward in the longitudinal direction, and we actually see the scars where the leaves would have kind of projected around, would have radiated around. Kind of interesting! </p>
<p>The next group of plants in Flora I are your seed ferns. So again, we're kind of contrasting to our pteropsids our true ferns. So the next group, though, are seed ferns, and so these aren't true ferns. They look like true ferns, but they actually have seeds and not spores, and this group of ferns is actually extinct. </p>
<p>The next stage in plant evolution is termed Flora II, and this refers to the time period that was the mid-Permian to the mid-Cretaceous, and refers to the organisms that were successful during that time. So we'll start with our gymnosperms. So gymnosperm refers to the idea of a naked seed, and they basically rely on wind to spread their pollen. Examples of gymnosperms are conifers, cycads, junipers and gingkoes, kind of a beautiful group there, but they all rely on the wind to spread the pollen, so that's kind of a key factor with these gymnosperms. Oh, and something I should note about Flora II is gymnosperms, they may have been more wildly successful during the mid-Permian to the mid-Cretaceous, but they're obviously still around today, and so we can observe really great examples of these gymnosperms in the recent environment. </p>
<p>The third group of Earth's tracheophytes is Flora III, and this time period is from the mid-Cretaceous to the Recent, and these were dominated by angiosperms. So these are flowering plants, or seed plants, and that means there's the presence of a flower, a nut or a seed. So angiosperms dominated Earths flora from the mid-Cretaceous on. Something interesting about angiosperms is that they rely on insects for pollination. So this is an example of coevolution, and this particular example of coevolution, where two species evolve to benefit from one another, is called mutualism, where both organisms are actually benefiting from that relationship.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="5.4_Pennsylvanian_Greenhouse_Earth">5.4 Pennsylvanian Greenhouse Earth</span></h1>
<p>The earth has been a much warmer place than it is now. We are all very concerned about global warming and its rapid effects that are taking place in our modern-day society, but during geological time, the earth has been a lot hotter. Can you imagine an earth that was 15 degrees Celsius warmer? And even places like the poles ended up having relatively balmy, warm days, whereas now in the modern-day environment, the average temperature in the South Pole is about negative 57 degrees Celsius. So a completely different Earth. So these time periods when the earth became warm, what drove that? Well, we had increases in volcanic activity, which produced more CO2 in the atmosphere. We also had changes in the amount of radiation that were hitting the earth from the sun. So collectively there were multiple things that happened, but in the end it made a dramatic increase in the temperature of the average temperature of the planet. And as a result of it, all the water that stored during cooler planet times in the ice, all that water left the ice, melted the ice sheets and went back into the oceans. So it raised the oceans during these warm greenhouse time periods a remarkable 250 to 300 meters above modern-day sea level. Can you imagine that? That means that in the United States, a place like New York City, which is now right at sea level, it would be 300 meters below sea level, and that means that places that are very cold now in the United States, places like Minneapolis, Minnesota, they'd actually be the beaches; they'd be the place where the warm waters would lap up against the edge of the continent. And in fact, if you ever tour through Minneapolis, Minnesota, you can see the examples of ancient beaches from these time periods that are fossilized and make the foundations under which all the buildings are built upon. </p>
<p>So the earth has responded to these warm, what we call "greenhouse" planet times, where the CO2 builds up, the earth heats up, the ice sheets melt, sea level rises. And that was the perfect combination, the perfect recipe in the Pennsylvanian time period to allow plants to rapidly evolve and then proliferate, have very large volumes of biomass grow all over the planet because of the warmth and because of the increase of the CO2. One of the products of that is that with the rapid development and production of plant material, that plant material, once it's formed it has to go somewhere. So it fell in place in marshes and deltas and what have you, it accumulated, those areas subsided, it became compressed and became a hard rock that we call coal, and we depend on these Pennsylvanian coals for a major part of global energy needs. So therefore, we have an Earth environment where evolutionary biology is responding to it by producing plants at a remarkable level and then having those plants be fossilized through time and produce the coals. So that's the Pennsylvanian greenhouse. </p>
<p>There's one more major greenhouse we want to compare and contrast to here, and that is the greenhouse that took place in the Cretaceous time period, in the latter third of the Mesozoic. So in that time period, we'd already had plants well-established, but in the Cretaceous, plants even went further, and flowering plants evolved very rapidly and very quickly, partially in response to, again, the high CO2, the high sea levels and the warm, average temperatures of the planet. But even more remarkably at that time, we had the proliferation of the dinosaurs. So as the planet warmed, remember the dinosaurs are ectothermic; they can't create much of their own body temperature, so they have to depend on receiving heat from the environment. So if you start having an environment that's overall much warmer, then the dinosaurs and other cold-blooded organisms are going to do extremely well. So the rise of the dinosaurs and their dominance in the Cretaceous was partially because it was a greenhouse Earth of high sea levels and very warm time periods. So we've seen the earth go through these traumatic time periods of very warm planet, no ice sheets and a high sea level, and evolutionary biology has responded in kind, in the Pennsylvanian with the proliferation of the plants, and then the Cretaceous with the proliferation of the dinosaurs.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="5.5_Rise_of_the_Reptiles">5.5 Rise of the Reptiles</span></h1>
<p>Reptiles are organisms that we know a little bit about in the modern-day environment because they still exist, and they're the first organisms that had a backbone that were able to leave the water and stay out of the water, both in terms of their lifestyle, what they ate, what they did during the day and the evening, but also they were able to stay out of the water when they reproduced, and this was something that the amphibians and the fish weren't able to do, so it was revolutionary to leave the water on a permanent basis. And they evolved a very strategically-meaningful and important mechanism for doing this, and that was they created an amniotic egg. It was a structure that allowed them to permanently leave the water and be able to reproduce on land. Now, the amniotic egg has a leathery outer membrane. In chickens it becomes hard, but in the case of the reptiles it was a leathery membrane, and that's the outer egg coating. And then inside the egg, the amniotic egg, we have two sacs. One of the sacs holds food and protein, and that's called a yolk, and the other sac holds waste products that are made by the embryo that's inside the rest of the egg. Now, we're familiar with these from chicken eggs. When you do break through the chicken shell, this is the kind of structure they have. But they're different because they don't have a hard calcium-carbonate-based outer shell. So this amniotic egg allowed them to reproduce out of the water. Basically, it carries the water environment with them, and that greatly increased their advantages for survival, in terms of competing and outcompeting and preying on other organisms. So leaving the water permanently was a fundamental benchmark evolutionary event. Now, the amniotic egg, then, in the reptiles, once that they left the water and that took place in the late part of the Pennsylvanian time period and we'll remember that the Pennsylvanian is called the upper part of the Carboniferous, if you are in Europe. So the Carboniferous in Europe is the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian ages within North America. So the amniotic egg is what allowed the three great lineages of the reptiles to leave the water. </p>
<p>Now what we want to do is recognize what those three types of reptiles were, because this fundamentally sets the stage for bringing onto the planet the dinosaurs, eventually the mammals, and all the other types of major invertebrates that have ruled both the marine and the terrestrial environment since these time periods in the middle Paleozoic. So as we can see from this diagram, the skull is an example of the first great lineage of the reptiles, and that's called an anapsid. And the anapsids are distinct because they have an eye socket, but behind this eye socket on the skull, there is no hole, no opening. So that means that in order for them to hear, instead of having an ear like we have, they had to use vibrations that were sent from the ground or the water up through the rest of their skeletal structure. So the anapsids are the first of the great lineages of the reptiles. And the modern-day anapsids, the ones to remember are the turtles. </p>
<p>Now, another attribute of the anapsids is that they have teeth that are what we call non-differentiated. In other words, the teeth through their entire life, and the life of one single organism going from a juvenile to an adult, we call that the ontogeny of an individual, so the entire ontogenetic history of the teeth of the anapsids are non-differentiated. In other words, all the teeth are more or less the same. They don't have really distinct structure and sizes, and during the entirety of their lifetime, those teeth are exchanged and redistributed and replaced throughout the history of the organism. So the anapsids are the first great lineage, and modern-day turtles are the example. </p>
<p>The second one is what we call synapsids, and you'll see synapsid, it has one skull opening behind the eye socket. So if you go from the eye socket and then backward on the skull, there's only one opening, and hence the word "synapsid." The synapsids are the reptile lineage that eventually led to mammals. So this is the, uh, the lineage of reptiles that we have evolved from ourselves. One of the hallmark characteristics, besides having one hole behind the eye socket, is that these organisms have differentiated teeth. In other words, there are canines like we have, they're our front incisors; there are molars in the back. If you forget this, all you have to do is look in the mirror, because humans have evolved from the synapsids. So differentiated teeth, and those teeth are not constantly replaced throughout the ontogenetic history of the individual. Those teeth are only replaced once, and again, if you forget this, just remember from your own history, growing up yourself. So the synapsids is the second great lineage. </p>
<p>The third great lineage of the reptiles is called the diapsids, and the word "di" is "two," and that means that there are two openings in the skull that are behind the eye socket. And another thing really important about the diapsids is that they were the lineage that eventually led to the rise of the dinosaurs and then eventually to the rise of the birds. So this is the other major group of reptiles, and one of their hallmark characteristics, besides having two holes behind the eye socket, is that their teeth, again, as the anapsids are, they are non-differentiated. In other words, there's not a lot of difference between all the teeth; they have more or less the same kind of morphology, but also throughout the ontogenetic history of the individual, all of those teeth are continuously replaced. Alright, so now we have our three great lineages, and what we want to think about are what are some of the types of organisms, reptiles, that evolved that represent these lineages. We mentioned the turtles was for the anapsids, and most people are familiar with the idea there is an outer shell and then the turtle is able to retract its head completely within the shell. We're not going to spend a whole lot of time on the turtles. They're fascinating, they're interesting, but they end up being not extremely important for the fossil record in the way that the other two great lineages are, the diapsids and the synapsids. </p>
<p>We want to now embrazen in our mind exactly what the differences are between the synapsids and the diapsids, the rise of the dinosaur lineage and the rise of the mammal lineage. So let's look first at our historical lineage, that's the synapsid reptiles. The synapsid reptiles basically had three major types that we want to remember; the first one are called pelycosaurs. And the pelycosaurs were heavy-boned, they had large front limbs, and they actually created organisms that, from a distance, and if you didn't think carefully or at least take a course in evolutionary biology, you'd probably think that these things were dinosaurs, looking at them briefly. But they are by no means dinosaurs; these are pelycosaur synapsids which led, eventually, to the rise of the mammals. Now, there were many types of pelycosaurs. Some of them were small, lizard-like organisms, 50, 60, 70 centimeters in length, but there was another one that rose to the point that was remarkable because, A, it became the top predator in the terrestrial environments that it lived in during the Pennsylvanian and at the early part of the Permian, but then it also has a very distinct morphology. It has a series of spines that rises off the back part of the vertebrae. So these spines rose upwards of a meter off the back of the pelycosaur. And the pelycosaur, this particular group, it made up 70% of the predators that were living at the early part of the Permian, 70%! That's a huge proportion. In other words, these were the first major terrestrial predators, and they did incredibly well. </p>
<p>So the name of the pelycosaur that had the spines that were so prevalent at this time period is called Dimetrodon. And the spines of Dimetrodon rose up approximately a meter or so off its back; they were small and slender, and then some of them had cross links on them to even make more surface area. So the way the spines worked is that they would stretch membranous skin across the spine network, and then, the hypothesis is, based on imprints of blood vessels and other things in the bone mass, that they actually flexed blood through those membranes, and if they had the membranes in their large fin of spines on the back, if they position themselves with the sun, they could warm up their blood. All of these organisms were ectothermic; they derived the majority of their heat from the environment. But one possibility though is also not just heating their blood using the spine framework, but they could also cool it. If they became too hot during the day, they could reposition themselves in the shade, flex the blood through it, and that would also allow heat to be dispersed instead of being acquired. So Dimetrodon was extremely important to us, and some of these even got up to 300 kilos in size, so these were major predatory organisms. They moved pretty fast, and another hallmark of the organism is they had a very large canine, the incisors that come down on each side of the mouth, and that allowed them to attack quickly bite into prey and hold onto it as they ripped it to shreds. </p>
<p>Now another type of organism that we want to identify here is the therapsids. So we went from the synapsid lineage, which came up in the Pennsylvanian, to the first major synapsids that were predators, which were pelycosaurs, and the main one that we identified within them is Dimetrodon. Then the next stage in evolution were the therapsids, and the therapsids were large, wolf-looking reptiles. They had spines and scales that evolved to become very thin and narrow, and eventually hair. So they had an early form of hair that covered the entire body. And hair is really important, because hair is very good at trapping air, and trapping air is one of the best mechanisms for insulation. So once they got body heat derived primarily from the environment, then they could trap and keep that body heat with the hair. They also had the large incisors, they had an extended snout, and for all practical purposes, as you can see from this diagram, they looked a lot like a wolf. So the therapsids were the next important evolutionary step, and towards the end of the Permian, the Dimetrodon organisms were replaced and outcompeted and preyed upon by the therapsids. </p>
<p>Now the therapsid, again, this is still in the lineage to the mammals, was much larger, is twice the size. It had an extended, as you can see from this diagram, a much larger set of front legs, and therefore the animal kind of stood with its shorter back legs, upper front legs, and it stood almost like a wheelbarrow upward, and it had extremely large musculature that covered the pectoral areas of the front limbs. And then it also, on top of that, developed extremely large muscles in the jaws. As you can see from this diagram that the jaw had muscle attachments that were coming out in the bones that allowed large masses of muscle to attach to it. So these things could really rip and shred, and because of their big, bulky, extremely well-developed musculature in the front, these again were the next version of a very serious predator on the planet. </p>
<p>Now, something we want to think about for the lineage of the synapsids is that this group of synapsids called the therapsids, they made it through and survived the greatest meteor impact that we've had so far. This is at the Permian-Triassic boundary, approximately 251 million years before present. 85% of what was living on the planet went extinct at that time, but the therapsids made it through. And again, if you forget about some of these things, just remember, we are humans, we derive ourselves from the synapsids; therefore we know that the synapsid reptiles were one of the ones that survived the great meteor impact, and we call that the Permian-Triassic boundary meteor impact event. </p>
<p>Now let's move to the diapsids, because the next step in the synapsid evolution is to move into mammals, and we're going to be looking at some of those in more detail. But to lay the groundwork, we want to now switch over to the third lineage of the reptiles, called the diapsids. And the diapsids are extremely important to us, because as they rose in this time period, they developed reptile-like organisms, they were reptile, but they looked like reptiles, and especially some of the reptiles we still have now, and eventually evolved into the true dinosaurs. So the diapsid lineage included a whole series of types of reptiles that first invaded and did very well back in the marine environment. Now remember, the reptile is defined by having an amniotic egg that let them leave the water and move into the terrestrial environment. But indeed, once they got out they found it was advantageous to get back in. And so the first set of reptiles that evolved all lived in marine environment, and then some of those again reemerged from the water, and then they were the ones that evolved into the dinosaurs. And importantly, we're going to see that that lineage then is capped by the end of the dinosaurs, which eventually evolved, then, into the birds. So each day that you're walking across a set of trees or any place on campus, or wherever you are and you hear birds, that's the song of ancient dinosaurs; its' not just simply the song of modern-day birds. So the diapsids, the synapsids and the anapsids; these are the rise of the three great lineages of the reptiles.</p>

<p>We are hot animals. We are able to produce body heat and maintain that body heat and keep it regulated at an incredibly narrow range. So if any of you woke up this morning not feeling too well and you developed a fever, that's one of the indications that your body is not doing well. So the fever is showing that you're moved off your tightly-regulated temperature, because in that case your body is responding to bacterial infection, and then using the heat to hopefully kill the bacteria that have invaded your body. So we take for granted this absolutely miraculous machine called our body that can maintain a high temperature and keep it absolutely consistent. </p>
<p>Now, if someone asks you to create a machine that could maintain high temperature and keep it consistent, we'd be really hard-pressed, right? It's a hard achievement to do. So, Mother Nature and evolutionary biology approached this experiment with the rise of the three great lineages of the reptiles, and these early reptiles are known to have not had the ability to maintain the kind of body heat that we take for granted. So heat regulation, or another word for this is thermal regulation, was a key strategy that had to be achieved, at least to some level, eventually by these lineages of the reptiles. And the three great lineages of the reptiles; the anapsids, the diapsids and the synapsids, the synapsids rose eventually to evolve into mammals, and we are one of the products of that, and so we know that that lineage ended up being extremely good at thermal regulation. But a lot of the questions are evolved around the diapsids, the lineage that led to the dinosaurs, and were dinosaurs cold-blooded or hot-blooded? So the ability to generate your own body heat, we call that endothermic. You have chemical reactions within your body that then result, partially at least, in the production of heat. Another thing that these reactions do is they feed us and create energy. So endothermic organisms. </p>
<p>The other end member, in this case a reptile, is not able to generate its own body heat and has to rely on gaining heat from the environment, and we call that ectothermic. So the first reptiles were all ecothermic. They need to have some heat in order to move around and use their muscles and hunt and do their everyday lifestyle. So they had to do things by engaging with the environment to attain that heat, and the easiest way to do that is -- and we've seen this before in many environments on modern-day Earth -- is that if a reptile needs to get warm, they go out and sit in the sun. So sun-basking was one great way to warm up your body, and once your body warmed up, then you would go about your daily activities. </p>
<p>Now, that all sounds fine and good. Now, one aspect of this is that if you are going to be in the business of making your own body heat, it's much better for you to A, be small, and B, be able to access primarily proteins in your diet instead of carbohydrates and plants and some of the other aspects of what can be available for you to digest and intake in the environment. So there's some trade-offs here; if you want to generate your own heat, you have to have a different kind of diet, and that diet has to be protein-rich. </p>
<p>So the endothermic and the exothermic, now, one of the questions is, we have good evidence that indicates that the first reptiles in the Pennsylvanian and into the Permian, that they were exothermic. However, as we move into the Permian, and especially within lineage of the synapsids, as we went from pelycosaurs into therapsids, we have now entered the regime where we start finding the fossils of these reptiles distributed in relatively cold latitudes on the ancient Earth. So instead of being in tropical latitudes, you know, their thinking is if something's exothermic they're probably going to live in the tropics because that's where you have the most heat all the time, we actually start finding at mid-range to relatively high latitudes the fossilized remains of some of these synapsid reptiles. So we know that because these fossil finds were at high latitude to mid-latitude that they had to have at least at some point been able to generate their own body heat by the Permian time period. </p>
<p>Now another aspect of this, and this all comes into play, as we're going to see the great distribution and radiation of the different lineages of the reptiles through the Mesozoic and into the Cenozoic, we have some trade-offs that we want to remember here. One, if you have a small body size, you have what we call a surface-area to body-mass ratio. So in other words, if you're relatively small, if you're the size of a cat or a dog or a mouse, if you're an organism that's small, A, you're going to have a diet that is going to allow you to generate more heat, and that's a higher-protein type of diet, but B, the other part of this is that you're going to, by definition, if you are small, the relative area of the surface of your body compared to your mass is relatively large. So the smaller you are, the larger that is, and what difference does that make? Well, the mass of your body is what is the proportional driving force for how much heat you can either attain or create or release, and so you have the body mass that's encompassed in a certain given amount of surface area. So when your surface-area to body-mass ratio is really large, that means that you can exchange heat readily with the environment. It's easy for you to either gain heat from the environment or lose heat to the environment; it goes relatively quickly. </p>
<p>How about the other end of the spectrum? What if you become a gigantic, herbivorous, plant-eating, long-necked saurischian dinosaur, you know, the ones we all like to think about that weighed tons and tons, and they could actually just standing there they could eat plants that were up on a 30-meter high tree? These are really large organisms. So, but they paid a penalty for being so big, because when you're that large, you have a small surface-area to body ratio. That seems counterintuitive, right? But your body mass is so large that whatever area you have surrounding your body mass, if you have body mass to that scale, then your surface area is relatively low compared to that. So your small surface-area to body-ratio means that you are really bad at either gaining heat from the environment or letting heat go. </p>
<p>So the giant dinosaurs, they had this small surface-area to body ratio, and they had to be very careful. When they went out to warm up in the sun, they had to be there a long time. Now, one of the ways that they fought against predation is simply their size, right? Their bodies were so large that they were much bigger than the jaws of-of some of the even the biggest predators like T-Rex. Now, T-Rex would hunt in packs and take down these organisms eventually, but it was very hard for single allosaurs or T-Rex or any of the big saurischian dinosaurs to be able to take down some of these big herbivorous dinosaurs. So they had to stay out, though, a long time, which made them more vulnerable to some of this predation. But the other thing, actually more important about this small surface-area to body-mass ratio is that it took them a lot of time to cool off. So if they were to start generating some kind of heat endothermically, it took them a long time for it to be released. So if there was some endothermic heat reaction that would build up, let's say, as those dinosaurs would try to move quickly or even run, there was the danger that they could actually start cooking themselves, because they were so bad at releasing heat into the environment. So this concept of endothermy and exothermy is kind of an underpinning for the entire evolution of these two major lineages of the reptiles, the synapsids and diapsids, and we'll see this, then, coming into play over and over again as we see the different waves of radiation and extinction of the diapsids and synapsids with time.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="5.7_Diapsids_and_Synapsids:_Ships_Passing_in_the_Night">5.7 Diapsids and Synapsids: Ships Passing in the Night</span></h1>
<p>If you've ever been on a boat at night and came upon another boat, the boats are gliding through the calm, still waters of the evening, and hopefully not colliding, but if you're cruising past each other, there's just the quiet splash of the water against the hulls, and the two boats are passing each other in the middle of the night. There's these large, very significant structures called ships, and they have people on them but they're moving quietly through the water, and they pass each other, going opposite directions. So we use this analogy, actually, for looking at the history of the rise of the synapsid reptiles and the diapsid reptiles. In essence, they were two major ships that have passed through the night, not once but actually twice, and this is an important metaphor for us to think about, because as we look at the evolutionary biology as it runs from the Paleozoic through the Mesozoic into the Cenozoic, we see that these two great lineages of the reptiles, they rise and they fall out of phase, out of concert with each other, and as one rises the other falls, and as the other falls the other rises, and vice versa. So this is kind of the stage that we want to think about in the history of evolution on our planet of the synapsid and the diapsid reptiles. </p>
<p>So let's dial back a little bit; we're in the Pennsylvanian. It's the rise of the three great lineages: the anapsids; the turtles, the diapsids; eventually dinosaurs and birds; and the synapsids; eventually the mammals. All three lineages arise at the same time in the late Pennsylvanian, but right off the block, our lineage, the synapsids, are the ones that did really well. The diapsids, the lineage of the dinosaurs, did very poorly. So going from the late Pennsylvanian into the Permian, it was a landscape completely dominated in terms of predation, big meat-eaters, that would be the big, beefy guys and girls that rules the landscape and preyed on whatever they wanted to because they were the best predators in town at that time, they were part of the lineage of the synapsids. Remember our friend Dimetrodon, which is part of the pelycosaurs, the first lineage of the synapsids. They rose to dominate the landscape by 70%, and in that time period in the Permian that was completely dominated by the synapsids, the diapsids, the lineage going eventually to the dinosaurs later on in the Mesozoic, they were very small, they were in the background, and they were preyed upon. So the end of the Paleozoic is a story of dominance by the synapsids. </p>
<p>Well, one of the underlying driving forces of the structure of geological time are meteor impacts, and at about 251 million years before present, we had an impact hit the earth, and one of the results was to cause 85% of what was living on planet Earth at that time to go extinct. It defines what we call the Permian-Triassic boundary; it's the boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic. One of the results of that was to reset the entire stage of this dominance of the synapsid lineage. So at the impact, and just after the impact, all three lineages of the reptiles got through the impact. Some of them did survive. 85% is a lot to go extinct, but not everything went extinct. Well, we pass through the impact event, and early in the Triassic we still had synapsid predators, the therapsids, the big reptiles that were very strong in the front, had smaller legs in the back, they were still predators, they were still dominating the landscape, but it didn't last long. And the Triassic is a story of these two ships, for the first time, called the diapsids and the synapsids, passing each other in the night. In other words, the previous dominant synapsid reptiles, after the Permian-Triassic boundary impact event, they did very poorly, and they were outcompeted and they were replaced by the diapsids. And in fact, the diapsids did so well and started radiating and diversifying to a point where they ruled the landscape, and by the late Triassic we had our first true dinosaurs. </p>
<p>So the reptiles that were diapsids, they invaded the ocean again, they invaded the land environment, and they rose to be the dominant predators. They ruled the entire landscape. So the Permian-Triassic boundary, and going into the early Triassic, is the first example of the synapsid ship going down, the diapsid ship going up, and the two of them passing silently through these transitions, to the point where we lived on a diapsid-ruled planet. And the rule of the diapsids and the eventual manifestation of that in the age of the dinosaurs lasted throughout the Mesozoic. Ah! Nothing can last forever, right? </p>
<p>So we get to a world dominated by the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous, and we had another major meteor impact. This one was at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, about 65.5 million years before present. That impact, it served to be a really bad day for the dinosaurs. Now, there are a lot of theories that suggest that perhaps the dinosaurs were already starting to fade, and that the meteor impact added to this and was the nail in the coffin, so to speak. But the meteor impact event defines the moment when the dinosaurs went extinct. Now, not quite so silently, right, we had another meteor impact, but this time, again, we had the two ships of the diapsids and the synapsids pass each other in the night, and as a result of the K-T impact, the Cretaceous-Tertiary impact event, the synapsids rose in the landscape right after the Cretaceous event, and the diapsids, the dinosaurs, became extinct, and only one really strong lineage of those dinosaurs survived to this day, which are the birds. </p>
<p>So it's a story of dominance in both the marine and the terrestrial landscape; it's the story of resetting the stage by having a catastrophic, cataclysmic event called a meteor impact hit the planet, reset the rules of the game. Now, Darwin laid out the idea that organisms are the result of survival of the fittest, but that's not such a good way to describe this necessarily. Actually, a better way to think about it is that these ships passing in the night are a great example of the survival of those who are fit the best to the environment. And one of the things that meteor impacts do is to change drastically the environment at a very, very quick pace. In other words, it happens instantaneously, and these rapid, catastrophic events end up changing the environment dramatically for a very long period of time. And because your organisms aren't evolved to the point where they are fit best to that new environment, then they're the ones who go extinct. </p>
<p>So two ships passing in the night: the synapsids and the diapsids. First the rise of the synapsids and the secondary place in history that the diapsids took at the end of the Paleozoic. Boom! Meteor impact! The rise of the diapsids; the secondary place is these synapsids. End of the Mesozoic. Boom! Another meteor impact. Rise of the synapsids; drop of the diapsids. The natural next step in this process of synapsid boat passing diapsid boat is that the modern-day environment on Earth is ruled by us, the mammals, and we are part of that synapsid lineage. But if history repeats itself to any degree, one way to look at the future is we're waiting for that next great meteor impact to hit, and we know it will, and when that happens, then perhaps the next manifestation is that the synapsid ship will once again pass the diapsid ship, and the era of the reign of the mammals will be over, and the next phase of the reign of the reptilian lineages that are derived from the diapsids, that's their time to take over the planet.</p>
