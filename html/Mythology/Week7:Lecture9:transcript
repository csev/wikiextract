Historical Background</p>
<p>As we're watching this play, we ancient Athenians, sitting in our theater, staring down at what's happening, the action that's happening on the stage. We can also see, looming up above us, one of the main features of what the play is supposed to be all about.<br />
There's the Acropolis right there, and it is magnificent to see.  This in an old pre-copyright photo. It is magnificent to see and if you and I are out in this, in the theater of ancient Athens and we're actually very close. We can see, right up above behind us the court that's being talked about in Aeschylus' place.
  So, what's being, the location of the performance is being set on stage.  But the stage setting is not more than, it is a very short distance away, uh from the court itself, which you and I have in our own eyesight.
  And at the end of the play, when the Furies get marched underneath the Acropolis and put into a temple, right underneath the Earth, they could've marched right off the stage and gone right down there.<br />
We would've been able to see it, as those that were viewing the play.  So it's very much what we're seeing, it's very much embedded in the surroundings, the actual physical surroundings of the play as it's being  performed in the Athens.</p>
<p>It's also referring to important themes that are emerging in classical Athens. Remember, this is the birthplace of democracy. A new system of, rule is being instituted here. And when Aeschylus's play is first being performed in 458, the institutions of democracy were not many decades old.</p>
<p>It was back in the year 510 B.C., when a group of people that were known as the tyrants were eventually kicked out. Nowadays, the English term tyrant mostly is synonymous with a terrible leader.  Then, it was a one man, one rule kind of indicator.  Some of these were worse than others. But the tyrants were these one-man one rule kind of system, and, for many, for centuries, they had ruled ancient Athens. With the advent of democracy, they're kicked out and the new system is put into place.<br />
 This new system has obvious strengths to it. I don't need to rehearse the benefits of having a democratic system of justice, a democratic system of society.  These are the goodness of the system is constantly being tested over history and that's, of course, the right kind of thing and, presumably, democracy has its own arguments to justify itself.
 But it's surely at the time it's forming in ancient Athens, a new form of ways of doing things, and it needs to have a kind of argument built into the play for it, and we can see in Aeschylus' treatment of this new system of justice a reference to what's happening in the democratic society around him.</p>
<p>Remember, Athena at line 696, endorses this new form, she talks about no anarchy, no rule of a single master:  Thus, I advise my citizens to govern. So, she jumps right in and says: it's time for just the citizens to be governing, and part of governing is going to be taking over questions of justice in a citizenry-based place of arbitration.</p>
<p>So, we're going to remove what had been the purview of these ancient beasts: The Furies following the blood and attacking and counterattacking and revenge.  We remove that away and put it into a court of justice that's run by a group of people like you and I.</p>
<p>Now, in order to talk about the virtues of this way of making things work and Aeschylus surely does that.  We also have to understand some of what was different about this system and with new and different things, there's always some sort of threat.</p>
<p>The old order, for example, had a strong basis in traditional ties. Ties of family and clan were what were thought to be most important.  Well now, the law, the state, the city. A new institution in the previous decades before Aeschylus was working on; a complicated network of voting districts. These were things that started to claim people's allegiance and sometimes, these would run parallel to family interests.  Sometimes they would run at cross-purposes to what family interests are.</p>
<p>The old system, in other words, had certain kinds of benefits.  It was based on a tradition of family ties that was clear.  It was easy to understand.  All of us would endorse family ties as being an important thing. So it seemed as though things in moving to this new system of justice, we're going to have to give some things up.
  In order to try to get a grip on what that is, I thought I'd just thought I'd toss out a experiment for you two possibilities.    Imagine that there is a situation where a son does something wrong.  A father comes in and punishes the son. Just thinking myself to my own situation.  If my father came along and decided that he wanted to punish me, well, I would kind of just have to take it. I would have to sit back and say, well, you know, here's my father punishing me, this is what dad's do and I might disagree. I might say, this, of course, dad's got it wrong. I, I didn't understand the whole context.  I'll, try to state my case later, but I know I'm getting punished now.</p>
<p>I might think that the father is wrong, but I'm never going to say: this father has no right to punish me, his son.  Of course, a father has a right to punish his son.  Thatâ€™s just goes with the territory. That's kind of builds in to the order of things.  Again, I might disagree with what's happening, I might resist, I might struggle, I might toss up my hands, but in the end, I kind of know that this is something that I just sort of understand, it's just way things are.
  Fathers have the right to punish sons. Now imagine, if I've done something that's a little sketchy, a little wrong, and I'm walking past some stranger and the stranger says to me: you've done something bad.  Let's say I jaywalked across the street and the stranger comes up to me and says, now I'm going to punish you, and starts to give you a punishment.
  What right does a stranger have to punish you?  Now, if your father wanted to punish you for jaywalking across the street, you just have to take it. The stranger wanting to punish you for jaywalking across the street. Who are you to get involved in my business? You don't understand anything about me.  I don't owe anything to you. You're just a person just like me.  What's your position of authority for you to be in a position of punishing me?
  Now, imagine that our thought experiment moves away from issues of not all that much consequence, where you get things that are socially awkward happening.  Imagine that it moves into a venue where the thing that's being punished is something of great consequence and great import, for example, a murder, and imagine that the punishment is hugely consequential and may result in the  depriving of a person of their fortune, of their family, their family fortune.
  May the, involvement of, depriving them of their freedom, to lock them up for years and years. Could be even to depriving them of their own life, they could get a punishment that takes their own life.
  Now, you're going to have to take this new system in which strangers,  who are your peers, all of the sudden have the power to mete out justice and you have to say, huh, do I trust people I've never met, total strangers to me, who are just  like me, to now judge an issue, a judgement against me that has real teeth, that could  do horrible things to me in my own personal future.<br />
Would I rather have those kind of situations being decided within my own family, where people know me, they know my strengths, they know my weaknesses, they surely know what contexts there are. They're going to give me the benefit of the doubt the best they can. They have a long-term connection with me. Wouldn't I want them to decide what the appropriate punishment is for me rather than some stranger?  It's surely the case that we would want that to happen because we would think that we would get off easier, but it could also be that even correcting for that just to say, yeah, I'd rather get off easy for the crime I know I committed.
  I think that most of us would at least agree that there's some help and having people that know you well trying to make a judgement about you, rather than having strangers make a judgement about you. So this new system has to figure out a way to justify itself to a group of people who may be uncomfortable being judged and punished by their peers, strangers, who are their peers, as opposed to people they're use to having connections with.
  Now, in this new system there's no blood relation, we've got abstractions, we have now a law that we're supposed to follow and we have, peers and strangers who are  meting out the authority.
 Aeschylus chooses to dramatize the Oresteia using this as a new kind of justice, the system that I've just  described. It's not at all obvious that someone has to tell the Oresten story this way. Aeschylus makes it go in this direction and he makes it a story that overall is about the proper way of meting out justice. This old crime that the old system had no way of solving, it turned into a cycle of retribution out of which there was no escape.
 The house of Atreus famously turning in on itself by this old system of justice. Aeschylus moves in and says: ancient Athens, you contemporary people watching this play, you have created a system  that's going to be able to solve this most knotty of all problems.  And, in fact, this is what happens in the play.  The climatic moment is when this court comes to a decision that counts as being just. Those in the audience, presumably think, yeah, there's some kind of justice being done here. You and I might disagree over the details of the argumentation. Some of them are things that, that contemporary observers of Aeschylus' drama are not going to with.  But we've got a system that's being sewn up.  And if we're classical Athenians, at least, our watching this saying to ourselves: You know, there is some promise to this new system. It can even solve this old crime or this old question of justice. Even more important, it takes the old system of justice based on the Furies and blood, and it gives them a new role. It builds a temple for them, puts them underneath in the chthonic area, as the kind of business and of this now human, this human court centered at the  Areopagus. 
It now becomes a kind of harsh side.  It's the violence behind what courts have a capacity to do. It now becomes institutionalized. Violence, thoroughly controlled and regulated by human institution. All of this in the end is authorized by Apollo and Athena. The Olympian gods are overseeing the whole process. And you and I as Athenians get to watch our court being shaped before our own eyes and having it solved something that even mythic times people were not wise enough to solve.</p>
