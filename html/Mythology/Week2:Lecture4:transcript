<p>Turning to Book 5 now, we see Odysseus, we get to meet him and we get to meet him exhibiting his hero-ness - not right off the bat in Book 5, but surely by the middle of Book 5 and forward.</p>
<p>Now, given all the characterizations I've given of Telemachus up to now as someone who sits around and feels sorry for himself and doesn't take action, as being not heroic, well when we meet up with Odysseus he is pretty much matching up with that description, isn't he? He has just been sitting on the beach and he's got Calypso, who's keeping him captive, this nymph goddess has him in her clutches, she won't let him go.</p>
<p>He feels sorry for himself and he cries on the beach. There is not much he can really do. That situation he is in, a powerless one, though, is soon going to change.</p>
<p>If you are sitting back wondering, you know, why did Odysseus spend quite so long on that island? Why doesn't he break free and get out of there? Then, the other side of you says to yourself, well it doesn't seem so bad. He is on an island with this beautiful nymph. She has desires for him and he seems to be in a bower of bliss, of course he's not leaving.</p>
<p>If you start down that path, well lots of people have started down that path in the past, too. The ancients themselves, when they read this epic were wondering why did Odysseus spend so much time with that goddess.</p>
<p>In any case, he is there and he is stuck. There is no way for him to get off. That is quite clear. He is not about to be able to break free of a goddess and his being trapped at the beginning of the epic is about to be changed.</p>
<p>Book 5, you will recall, begins...leads us into a new set of what we're going to be examining in the epic. We change course. Book 1 - 4 we've got Telemachus, in 5 - 8 we're going to start learning about Odysseus and a parallel kind of journey that he's going to make to a place where he can learn and get himself rebuilt.</p>
<p>For him, it is going to be a slightly different kind of a story. To mark this transition, we have, as we did at the beginning of Book 1, we've got an audience with Zeus. We go back up to the very top of the universe, we have our audience with Zeus.</p>
<p>There is a strong marker of transition there. And when the message is given to Hermes, go down and tell Calypso it is time to free Odysseus. When the message is given to Calypso, Hermes laces it with an interesting thing we shouldn't just let pass.</p>
<p>He basically says, don't cross Zeus. If you don't do what Zeus says, you know he will make your life a living hell. It means Zeus is going to crush you physically. Zeus' power in the universe comes from violence. People are frightened of him. This is the kind of starkness of the Homeric world from the top down that have been built into the power structures all the way up.</p>
<p>It is also the kind of thing we are seeing exhibited as the great elders of the large aristocratic society are telling Telemachus. It is time to get violent on those suitors. They are all expecting that's the next step. Well, Zeus shows us that that kind of thing happens in the wider scale of the universe, as well.</p>
<p>So, Hermes comes down and delivers the message to Calypso. It is time to let him go. Calypso relents. This goddess whose name Calypso comes from a word meaning to hide. Odysseus kind of disappears, withdrawn from life and the wider Greek world for those seven years.</p>
<p>He is pulled back and pulled out. At that time, when Calypso gets the message, she lets him go. And when she does, all she has to do is give him some tools. With tools, Odysseus can fix anything. He gets his axe, chops down the trees in a beautiful, elegant set of motions that are extremely efficient. He strips them, planes them and gets them perfectly true and binds them together, erects a mast, puts together all the different kinds of tackle that are required to make his sailing vessel sound.</p>
<p>In a few days, he has got a perfect ship ready to go. And once he gets started on that craft building, he can't be stopped. Odysseus is a great builder. This use of hands in the introduction of Odysseus in this scene of raft building shows his hero-ness fully on display.</p>
<p>Heroes are just good at things. They have skills. They get things done. They are good, yes, in a kind of abstract and realistic way, but they are really effective, efficient, they get stuff done. They take action and can get it done cleanly and efficiently.</p>
<p>So, Odysseus is gaining back some of what he lost over these last seven years being disappeared under Calypso. He is now getting his craft back. His wits are kind of coming back to him. He is able to make his route. Pages 159 and 160, the Fagles translation.</p>
<p>Of this sailboat, then, Odysseus jumps onto it and is able to sail it as a master sailor. He is not only good at building a raft, he is good at sailing a craft also. It becomes in his hands a perfectly seaworthy vessel. It is just a very primitive raft that he made from what was around him all by himself in a few days. Still, he is able to make it into a strongly seaworthy vessel.</p>
<p>But, of course, Poseidon shows up right there. We are going to learn lots about Poseidon. Why is it he is so angry at Odysseus? We are going to learn. Poseidon crushes him as he is trying to make his way.</p>
<p>Odysseus at that point tries to find where he can to land after he has journied for some time. He tries to find out where it is he can land. He is looking for a spot now where he can get into a safe harbor.</p>
<p>If you are a sailor, you'll know that seeing a shoreline if you are in a bad situation, bad weather, seeing a shoreline is not necessarily your friend. If it is a gentle shoreline, or if it has an inlet or a port, that is perfectly good, you can get in and get out of the storm.</p>
<p>But, if you have a shoreline that doesn't have a nice place for you to land, a shoreline may mean certain death. Odysseus is facing that kind of thing. He is being tossed by the waves and is trying to calculate his way into the shoreline that is nearby him after Poseidon crushes his raft.</p>
<p>He is able to sense when he gets nearby the current of a river that is flowing out from the mainline. This is for him a sign that there is saftey there. He can sense in his body the river nymph. It is as if there is a second nature to him to know where saftey is going to come.</p>
<p>So, he finds his way in. And where there is a river, there must be a way for him to swim in to get away from the violent crashing of the waves of the sea against the shoreline. Get into the river, get inland and at that point he can crawl out without problem.</p>
<p>When he gets into the inlet and gets out of the river, washes up on shore, Odysseus now emerges literally naked from the roiling sea and just plops on the shoreline. There is not much life left in him at all.</p>
<p>In fact, all that he really has is the ticking of his heart, the only thing that is left operative.</p>
<p>On page 167, he still has enough of his brain power to start a calculation. He wonders to himself if it would be wise for him to stay nearby the river overnight. If he does that, he runs into a danger he realizes, he calculates. That danger is he could be exposed because he remembers that "a wind blows cold from a river toward dawn."</p>
<p>So, though it may seem OK now, by dawn there will be a cold air blowing across him and he could expire from exposure. So he decides maybe he should go inland more.</p>
<p>But, if he moves inland, he is going to make himself vunerable to becoming prey for wild animals that will hunt him and eat him. So, he is stuck in a situation where he has to choose between dying of exposure staying on the shoreline or die by being eaten by going into the shelter of the woods.</p>
<p>So, what he does is choose a middle course. He set out for the woods not far from the water. And he gets himself into a situation where he can make a rudimentary shelter for himself. Here we see again Odysseus' craftsman like self coming back in spades and showing itself.</p>
<p><strong>Quote on screen:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>He "found a grove with a clearing all around and crawled beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root, one olive wild, the other well-bred stock. No sodden gusty winds could ever pierce them, nor could the sunâ€™s sharp rays invade their depths, nor could a downpour drench them through and through, so dense they grew together, tangling side-by-side."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr Struck reads the passage above.</strong></p>
<p>Odysseus, using his craft, starts to gather up what he finds. In fact, he finds leaves, he finds lots of leaves. An abundance of leaves and his reaction is to feel overjoyed. He thinks there are extra leaves, so many leaves it could be shelter for lots of guys. Yet, I've got all these leaves to myself.</p>
<p>He looks forward to what he is able to make out of the situation around him. He anchors onto the positive things, he focuses on what he is capable of. He doesn't sit back and feel sorry for himself for having to sleep in dead leaves all night. Instead, he thinks this is great, I've got this abundance of leaves. This is kind of poignant when you think about poor old Odysseus.</p>
<p>He is stuck at the very end of Book 5, the leaves are all around him, he has crafted himself this special kind of bed out of olive leaves that is going to, we hope, keep him alive for the evening. Homer closes with a wonderful poignant simile about the situation our hero finds himself in.</p>
<p>"As a man will bury his glowing brand in black ashes, off on a lonely farmstead, no neighbors near, to keep a spark alive â€”no need to kindle fire from somewhere else â€”so great Odysseus buried himself in leaves and Athena showered sleep upon his eyes . . . sleep in a swift wave delivering him from all his pains and labors, blessed sleep that sealed his eyes at last."</p>
<p>So, Odysseus gets his rest at the end of Book 5 after a long book of struggle, after a long book of getting him away from Calypso, after excaping the dangers he finds at sea, getting himself inland, getting himself out of the danger of dying of exposure, escaping, we hope, the danger of getting eaten by a wild animal. Buried like a firebrand, glowing piece of metal underneath ashes as if he himself is now being buried, ashes being associated with a funerary rite, as if he himself is being buried. All that he hopes is that he can last until the morning.</p>
<p>We will find out at the beginning of Book 6 if he makes it.</p>
