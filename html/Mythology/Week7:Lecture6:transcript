<p>Libation Bearers</p>
<p>Aeschylus's Agamemnon is the first in a sequence of three plays that survives in entirety from antiquity.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, when we talked about tragedy tragedies came across in antiquity in groups of three. You would go and watch a trilogy being performed, and there would be plays in the beginning and end of that in different genres. But the tragedy itself came in three parts. And from antiquity, the pieces that survive, only one of them has all three parts in place and this is the Oresteia all together.
 We're reading two of the three parts of this play, the first and last, and I wanted to give you a sense of what happens in the middle of the Libation Bearers, and if any of you all want to read it on your own, please do.</p>
<p>In the center of the story Orestes takes action. He moves into this place that leaves him in the sad state that he's in at the beginning of the last play of the trilogy, as we'll see when we turn there.</p>
<p>The, Libation Bearers, the second installment, we have this new generation then of Orestes and Electra that are going to be infected by this miasma. We talked about the floating around, nasty kind of curse that is stuck inside this family and what's going to happen to it. At each turn, people engaged in the action try to make the curse go away.</p>
<p>Remember, Clytemnestra thought that by doing away with her husband, justice was now done and the end was here, and we finally had done right by the world. But things get a little bit ugly. Now, she is going to face retribution from her own son, Orestes. 
We see here a beautiful depiction on a piece of the ancient pottery with Orestes and Electra on either side of the pillar. They are representing the tomb of their father, and our Electra's I'm sorry, Orestes' friend, Pylades next to him. The three of them are engaged in the action that winds up in Clytemnestra's death.
 The play is again sparse and spare in its action, just as all these ancient tragedies are.
 Orestes returns to Argos. He's been away. He and Electra get together then and decide to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. Orestes and Electra conduct -well, it's basically a séance-. They hang out at the grave of their dead father, and they pour over libations and pray to earthly powers. The large forces that are percolating underneath the earth, including the earth itself… these powers are something that in the long scheme of understanding where the Greek world comes from.</p>
<p>As we know from reading Hesiod, these are powers that were defeated by Zeus and buried underground. When Zeus has got these nasty things in control underneath there, yes there, they are definitely in control under Zeus's under binding. And yet, humans when they need extra help, when they are in terrible situations that they can't solve themselves, they appeal to these buried chthonic powers to try to gain purchase on their situation up here. That they otherwise couldn't get by appealing to the gods of the daytime.
 So, in desperate situations, as Orestes and Electra are in appeals to the earthly powers is what starts to call people's attention. They then pray to Agamemnon's shade, and different kind of early divinities that we saw mentioned in Hesiod's Theogony. And they want permission to go ahead and carry out these murders. They basically get it. They're authorized to go do this. And it sends them, then off into the terrible set of actions.</p>
<p>Orestes and his friend Pylades disguised themselves as foreigners. They then kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, but not before Orestes and Clytemnestra have a long, drawn out face to face. Clytemnestra is good at verbal tests of will. We saw her do that in the Agamemnon. She does that with her son. He is about to kill her, and telling her why it's okay that he is about to kill her. She, on the other hand, is arguing back, saying, you know, my goodness, Of course, it's not okay for you to kill me. And they have this long, drawn out test of, of face to face argument and battle.
 Orestes then drags her behind the door, as we know things happen back there, kills her, we spring the door open, see that she's dead. And Orestes at that point reappears and he's happy at this stage at the end of the Libation Bearers, that everything's finally over.</p>
<p>He has now exacted revenge for his father's murder and everything is going to be okay. But, we would probably by now surmise, that's not the case. Up pop a new breed of nasty divinities. These things called the Furies. </p>
<p>The Furies are going to play a critical part of the next part of the story. They start to swoop around, and now that Orestes has blood-guilt on his hands, they're going to come after him. We'll see them hovering around in the background. They're agents of justice in this older order of things based on blood. 
Remember the Furies themselves, we saw a mention of them in Hesiod's Theogony. There's a connection there, there with the severed genitals of this guy. Remember, after Cronus cuts off the genitals, he tosses them into the ocean, or into the sea. And from there, Aphrodite grows up, according to Hesiod's story, also from the drops of blood that drip into the earth, nasty things come out including these Furies.
 They are born from the drips of blood of the severed genitals of this guy. This background, tied to the blood and to awful, internal family crimes, really helps specify what they are all about in the story, and the role that they're playing inside of The Oresteia.
 They're like blood scenting hounds. They're just going to pursue a criminal as long as they smell blood-guilt on that person's hands. And they'll pursue the criminal relentlessly. There are no exceptions to the rules that they obey. There's no room for persuasion, the punishment is fixed. And it's absolutely not something that someone could talk themselves out of in some kind of a longer story.
 Aeschylus is going to turn from this older order of justice, based on revenge, blood-guilt, the Furies as enforcers. He's going to turn from that to a new idea of justice that's going to turn this old one on its head. And we'll see that in the next installment of the trilogy, when we get to the play the Eumenides by Aeschylus</p>
