<p>So, we mentioned tragedies having this very compressed action. That's definitely true in this play, The Agamemnon.
    Agamemnon's story is quite straight-forward and relatively easy to tell. We've got a very beginning scene where there's this watchman. He's sitting up on top of a roof, and wondering what's about to happen. He's got his eye out. He's trying to see some kind of a beacon.  There must be a beacon out there. Well, what he's looking for is a beacon that has been preset on a mountain that's as far away from Argos as this watchman is able to see and atop of a mountain. And that mountain has got a pre-positioned fire that is positioned as far away from another mountain top as a person is able to sitting on that mountain top, and so on, and so on, and so on. And these mountain tops lead all the way back to Troy. 
    So, seeing there's a mountain top far away from Troy and seeing that Troy is burning, that person, the first man stationed at the signal fire, lights a fire on his mountain top right near by Troy. The one farthest away lights a single beacon, on top of his mountain top, and so on, and so on, all the way around the Agean Sea, until the fire from Troy literally leaks out and comes over to Argos, comes over to Mycenae, Agamemnon's home town. 
The fire from Troy has come and visited them. This technology of a signal beacon, really extraordinary. 
Clytaemnestra gets a word right away that her husband has conquered Troy. Now, that wanting to get that signal, you might want to have imagined that if you were operating from an Odysseus and Penelope kind of stand point, that, you know, they wanted to find out when their loved one was going to be home so they could have a nice reunion. Well, in this case, no, not at all. 
    Clytemnestra wants to find out when her loved one is going to be home because she set up things to kill him. That extra technology of the beacon signal is being used to work out her own internal nastiness, that works out inside this family. 
    We've got a back and forth, then Clytemnestra appears. She has back and forth with the chorus. Starts talking to them about what's been going on. The herald then appears and has a back and forth with the chorus as we are getting ready to see Agamemnon come and then, boom, Agamemnon arrives right near the beginning of the play. Isn't it? It's not too far end. 
Agamemnon arrives, and we have a long back and forth discussion between Agamemnon and his wife, Clytemnestra. Their greeting is a far cry from, you know, hi, honey, I'm home. It's been ten years, nice to see you. It's a back and forth kind of verbal test of wills. Not right out in the open but very subtly in a subterranean way, they're taking each other’s measure, such that Clytemnestra is making sure that she's going to be able to kill this guy. And Clytemnestra, or Agamemnon, is just kind of trying to make his way into his own house again and figure out where things stand. Not very clever. 
Agamemnon is not held up in the mythical Greek myth as being a clever man. He's an extremely strong man, but he's brutish. He's not very clever. And as another indicator of that, he comes back with his prize from wartime. His concubine new wife, Cassandra, and brings her right out into the open. And, you know, here she is, Clytemnestra. Here's your, you know, here's your new wife’s friend that's going to be my new wife. We'll have to find a place for her. 
Having multiple sexual dalliances as we know from Odysseus, that just kind of happens. Greek men exonerated themselves from thinking of that as a bad thing. They just went ahead and had thought of that as just fine. But, there clearly is a kind of line that Agamemnon is crossing here. He's being a bit brutish about it. You don't rub it in Clytemnestra's face. You would do it more subtly. But, Agamemnon just waltzes in with Cassandra right there and they have this conversation. Agamemnon and Cassandra go back and forth, long verbal battle, verbal battle goes back as they kind of work their way back and forth. 
Then, Agamemnon takes the invitation to trample on the Crimson path. Well, we have a lot to talk about when we deal with the thematics of the play in the coming lectures. Agamemnon and Cassandra and Clytemnestra then have a kind of a long back and forth set of conversations. At that point, Agamemnon and Clytemnestra disappear behind the door. There they are back there. They disappeared behind the door. And Cassandra then is invited in. Clytemnestra comes back out and says, oh, you, young lady. Please come. You're welcome too. Cassandra then does this long slow march toward the door, and as she's doing it, she's actually seeing her own death. Cassandra's prophesying her own death. She sees what's going to happen behind that door, and it's going to involve her, and it's going to be very ugly. More to say on that, too, when we deal with the thematics. Then, awful things happen behind the door.<br />
The doors burst open and Aegisthus comes booming out and we have a back and forth with the chorus as we try to figure out what just happened and how we're supposed to value that. It's a complex situation with lots of nasty stuff that's going on, and what we're supposed to make of all that. 
This scene is famous, depicted in lots of different representations graphically. It's something that Greeks clearly spent some time thinking about it, arresting the imagination. The story of Agamemnon here emerging from his bath. You can see he still has his robes around him. Again, recovering this theme, and we will talk about it, the cleansing that's attempted to happen in Agamemnon's family line turns into a murder. A bath becomes a blood bath. 
Aegisthus then thrusts the sword into him. This, wonderful mixing bowl has a whole series of vignettes aspects of the story of Agamemnon's house, all in a giant circle. And that circular pattern is used by the artist that makes the bowl. At one piece, we have Aegisthus taking out Agamemnon. Cassandra? (Clytemnestra)  is nearby and here she's carrying her double ax, while she's aiming her double axe right there at her own son. Her son who's involved in killing her, the father Agamemnon, with the daughter Electra nearby. The sons, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, all of them are just on top of each other. And the crime that's stuck inside this family seems to have no way of getting out. 
The spare action of this particular part of the story in the Agamemnon is going to lead us to this one, a very dense close up look at one part of the story: Agamemnon's killing. Each piece of it is going to get pulled out. We're going to look forward to the nasty things that are going to happen later in the Oresteia. And we're definitely going to look backward to all the things that have led up to this, including the story of the daughter of Agamemnon, Iphigenia, that we haven't talked about yet. Or, sorry. Daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra that we haven't talked about yet the story of Iphigenia. All kinds of things to talk about. and get ready for some special flavors of ugly family nastiness coming up next.</p>
