Week 8 
Lecture 8.5</p>
<p>Chtonic Identity</p>
<p>Oedipus' story of Thebes is rooted in a family with close connections to the land. Yes indeed.  We've seen. Or I mentioned earlier in one of our lectures, the connection of this figure Cadmus in Oedipus' own background.  The founding families of Thebes, it was told, emerged when Cadmus was on a journey from his family ancestral home in Phoenicia, and comes to the place of Thebes and there's a serpent on this, that is wound itself around a spring, and is now threatening people who try to get there. Cadmus, who is powerful and strong, slays the serpent, takes the serpents teeth and throws them into the ground.  Well, from these teeth sprout up out of the ground itself grand heroes that are armed. They have this massive battle, fight one another in this archetypal act of fratricide.<br />
Five of them survive and they become the founding families of Thebes.  This is the story. This is where the Thebans understand themselves to come from. Or at least this is where the Athenians understand the Thebans to come from. Remember, these are Athenian based tragedies that we see. So these five men survive, become the founding families of Thebes, and introduce us to another in our installment of universal laws.</p>
<p>Remember we're saying universal with tongue in our cheek just a little bit. Universal law number seven: a deep connection to the land is a common human expression.  Humans have loved to claim deep connections to the land.  There is an aristocratic dimension to this that shows up in Greek materials.  And I'm familiar with some aristocrats, in my own experience. People who claim they are a seventh generation Bostonian or an nineteenth generation Floridian or whatever happens to be. People get great pride when claiming to have been connected to the land.  I think that there's some residual sense of back in a feudal society.  The idea that this land just kind of came to you, and it belongs to you in some sense. The, the idea of being dislocated and wandering, such as, Odysseus embraces, is also a little bit disconcerting, and to think that you have an actual rooted connection to a land, is a nice thing to have. 
Well, the Greeks surely thought that.  And in a story like the stories like we see in the founding families of Thebes, there's a strong, connection to the land.  In fact, the idea shows up in this idea of birth from the land itself.  There's a Greek term for this, called autochthony.  Autochthony, meaning from the ground itself.  Remember chthonic is a term we've already ran into talking about earth-based things and auto, added in front of that means the earth itself.  So autochthony is a theory that people were born from the earth itself. This expresses a deep connection to the land. Of course you were born from it.  It's your own room, I mean, you came up out of it.  You're sort of emerged there like a plant belonging to it.
Stories of autochthonous birth are common in ancient myth.  We have connections to the earth, and great heroes in the past.  There are hints that they have these connections.  When people do have autochthonous connection to the land, they also are going to have some defect in the foot. This is typically associated with ideas of autochthony. The claim is, then, that if you grow up like a plant out of the ground. And you sort of, you know, pop up.  At some point, someone has to pick you. So they pluck you out of the Earth, and when they do, your feet get missfigured somehow, in one way or another.  We have this, if you will recall Achilles has his heel, this is probably connected with that background. He's got a weak spot at his lower extremities and his heel. 
Jason, a famous hero from the Greek side of things, famously loses a sandal, early on in his adventures, a suggestion there, is that there's a connection with autochthony that is. 
Feet are typically a side of vulnerability in Homer. We see this in the case of Hector. Achilles uses Hector’s feet as a kind of handle to drag him around.  Lameness of the feet shows up in other lineages of grand heroes where we think autochthony is being hinted at.  Whether it all coheres together in a single picture is another question.
In the case of Oedipus, it seems clearly to be something that's going on. Oedipus' name -recall that when we look at what the background of a Greek hero is-, we've gotta address what the name is.  We hear in Oedipus' own story that his background in Greek, his name is pretty closely linked to the Greek term for swollenness.  Oideo, a Greek term meaning to swell, plus pous, foot.  So Oedipus is: he of swollen foot. Now in his case, of course there are multiple reasons why his foot is swollen.  His father after all cuts right through his poor little infant tendons, and binds them together at his ankles, so he has vulnerability there. But there is a further connection to this autochthonous background that's being hinted at in talking about Oedipus' own lameness of his feet.</p>
<p>The feet come up in several places in Oedipus' story. And let's just pull out a few of these to have a look at them.<br />
Creon, talks about line 130, this sphinx.  The riddling sphinx induces us to neglect the mysterious crimes and rather seek solution of troubles at our feet.  Something right in front of them, yes, that seems to be what he's saying but also, there's a bit of a trouble when we get to Oedipus, with his feet.
  There's a neat, that's a riddle that needs solving.  Why is it, that there's this terrible scar there?  Taureseus 417 talks about a deadly footed, double-striking curse from father and mother both shall drive you forth. Oedipus' curse is connected with his feet, through Tiresias, this, prophet, who has,  Apollo's own insight. Jocasta,  King Laius pierced his ankles and bind the hands of others cast him forth.  So we have the mentioning of the pinning of the ankles of Oedipus.  Oedipus then jumps in talking about going on foot.  I was encountered by Harold and a carriage with a man in it, recounting his own version of the event where Lias gets killed.  He is on foot at the time. There's something, there's a connection there with Oedipus' rootedness in his foot-based identity.  And the messenger jumps in as he's telling Oedipus his own background: “I loosed you, the tendons of your feet were pierced and fettered, so that from this you're called by your present name, Oedipus of the swollen foot.” Each of these points in the story links us back to Oedipus' foot defect and the foot defect typically, in mythology, is tied to a background of autochthonous birth. A pure connection to the land.</p>
<p>So what Sophocles has done, extremely skillfully in tying these two things together, is to take some piece of Oedipus' past that is a purposeful intervention by his father in order to try to kill him.  In other words, the missfiguring of his feet.  And link it to another way of talking about Oedipus' own background.  That missfiguring of the feet, yes, can be an emblematic of the father's attempt to kill him and brush him aside. Or it can be emblematic of Oedipus' own connection to Cithaeron, his own special rebirth, and the ability to overcome the problems in his own life. He's now is going to belong in a special way to this land. This earthborn connection is going to give him a certain kind of rootedness that, despite his own father's attempts to erase  his connection to Oedipus, Oedipus is still going to survive and grow on from those. In fact, if his own father had not tried to ostracize him, put him out for lost on the hillside, Oedipus would not have been reborn and had this special connection to Cathyron.
 Now, the connection has, that a sadness to it, in addition to a sense of rebirth from the womb of Cathyron in the sense that he is now from nowhere.  He's literally from a trackless hillside. He doesn't belong to people anymore.  He's a singleton growing out of the earth. What's his background.  What's his connection. What's his name.  What do all these things do for him. None of them leads back to anything of linkage. Instead the only thing that has ground truth, so to speak for Oedipus anymore, is this autochthonous connection to Cithaeron.</p>
<p>The Giving us this iteration of a deep connectiveness has a sad kind of pathetic quality to it.  All that Oedipus has left is this barren wasteland and the idea that he's abandoned.</p>
<p>Autochthonous birth, has, in some sense, though, always, this sense of removing a person from genetic lineage, from genealogy. Where did you come from?  Well, who knows what people were in my background.  I came from the land itself. That fantasy of not having any lineage, any parents. To just sort of have emerged up out of nothingness is has a certain appeal for people with very complex family backgrounds. There's a, and a kind of ultimate escapism, I think built into this idea of Oedipus, that yes indeed that Cithareon is my background. His family connections are so messed up and compromised, he turns his back on them and now claims a special linkage only to that hill.</p>
<p>Eventually all this though the attempt to turn back on things and claim a connection to a land gets very complicated and suggests, in Sophocles own way I think, the complexity of human's claim to deep connection with the land, and instead I think, underwrites, or at least, keeps in front of us, the idea that we as human's are mostly, just, pretty much, always, going to be, wanderers. What connection to the land do we have, well, we're sort of stuck, with connections to each other, the only way to get away from that, is to, become, an escapist as Oedipus in his horrible, horrible story.</p>
