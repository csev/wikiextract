<p>Agamemnon Themes</p>
<p>In watching the story unfold, there are a lot of themes we can tie into.  The story is made with, there's a spareness in terms of the plot.  There's a spareness in terms of the set decoration and the presentation in antiquity.  There's also a spareness roughly in terms of the thematic elements that are there.
    There are a few really important themes that just keep getting worked and re-worked in lots of different guises to help us unfold the details about what or what's behind our story.  I'll start off with a couple of references, you'll see in parentheses up here.  I've got line number of references; these are to the translation we're using in the class.  They're going to be close-ish to other English translations and close-ish to the Greek, but none of them are going to lineup unless this is the translation in the University of Chicago series edited by Green and Lattimore.
    We have lots of references in the story to nets and webs.  The story that we get from, for example, contrasting with Homer's Odyssey, we'vegot there Penelope, who is weaving and un-weaving. And recall, what she does with that thematically that fits into a larger story.  It's Penelope staling people that are trying to break into her connection with Odysseus and pushing them off.  She is using the weaving and un-weaving in a, in a not completely intuitive way of keeping people away.  It's a method she used to protect herself.
       Nets, such as they appear in this story, are going to be nets that trap those nearby you.  The nets, webs, entanglements, all these interweavings.  In the Odyssey, remember, that closeness of interweaving was a symbol of connection.  Both Odysseus and Penelope together were plot weavers.  Here, the plots and connection and nettedness is all going to be a sign of too much closeness and a sign of nasty closeness.  Actual violence that gets brought between the groups.  </p>
<p>The Crimson Tapestry itself is the I think, the most prominent example of the kind of theme, theme of nettedness and knots that gets turned into a net.  Remember what happens, Clytemnestra says to Agamemnon, please honey, I haven't seen you for a long time.  Step on out of your boat with your muddy boots and trample on this beautiful cloth that I've woven for your return.  Now, you can imagine, I mean, the scene is quite loaded with bitterness.  Clytemnestra is, yes indeed, inviting Agamemnon to step on this thing and you can hear in the back of her mind, she's saying to herself, Yeah, and you're just the kind of person who would trample over such a fine thing that I've been making for you to trample on.  It's as though she has been carefully nurturing her own bitterness over the years, as she's weaving this thing thinking, oh, I bet he'll step on it, I bet he'll stepon it, I bet he'll step on it.  Well, yeah indeed he does, he goes off and steps on it.  And it just proves, it helps quiet a master of that thing becomes an instrument by which she can prove what a clod he is and how he does trample on fine things.</p>
<p>With the, the color of this tapestry is not just happenstance.  It's a deep rich purple dye that colors it.  This is a color that surely has a connection with blood, that's clear and obvious in our story.  It also, which may be obvious or, or may not, has a close connection with royalty.  The color purple was very hard to get.  It came from seashells off on the far eastern side of the Mediterranean.  Huge numbers of seashells were required to make small bits of this dye.  So, purpleness was associated with royalty from quite far back.  And to have an exotic beautiful tapestry here, died purple makes it even more valuable.  And also interestingly, more a sign of Agamemnon's grandeur.  So, he's being invited basically to, kind of, you know, trample and muck up his own grandeur.  So, the closeness that gets shown up in these connections with nettedness and the crimson path, all these show the dark side of intimacy.</p>
<p>Closeness can become inward turning and nasty; not supportive and, and mutually beneficial.  We have references to nets that are all over the place as represented by these line numbers.  There's a fishing net.  Cassandra talks about herself as fenced in by fatal nets.  There's a spiders web that gets mentioned.<br />
We talk about cords of justice.  Aeschylus seems to be going out of his way, to use imagery of cordedness and of nettedness to talk about lots of different things in this story.  Each time it's worth picking these apart and finding connections.  Secrecy, in this story.  We talked about how secrecy in the Odyssey had a way of creating intimacy.  There were secrets that were kept between people, away from other people, and help them maintain a connection.  Here, the secrecy is working to produce connections that are not being authorized by the normal course of events.  The secrets that Clytemnestra and Aegisthus hold, notice how Agamemnon is outside them.  He doesn't know what's happening.  They becomes divisive, the secrecy becomes a divisive instrument not a connecting instrument.  We've got examples of this also in that fire beacon.  I recall at the beginning of the night, everyone kind of knows what's going on with that.  And when Agamemnon shows up, he doesn't necessarily know that a signal has been put out and to try to catch him out; to try to announce his arrival ahead of time so that his wife can now betray him.  The meaning of that signal is not going to be at all clear to anyone else except Clytaemnestra.  </p>
<p>Then, further, we have a set of meditations on the theme of medicine and drugs.  In Greek, the term pharmacon, interestingly indicates a drug.  And like the English, it has an ambivalence to it.  It could mean both poison, in the sense of a drug that drugs a person to death.  It could also, though, mean a cure.  A drug in the sense of a medicine.  So, the term pharmicon shows up in this double valenced way several points in the epic.  Or sorry, in the several points in thestory.  You'll see it in the lines referred to here.  And then, also, in a couple of points where Clytemnestra mentions that there's really, things are just not quite working out right in this story.  There's no God of healing, she tells us toward the end as she's making her final walk into the into Clytemnestra's palace.  There is no god of healing.  It's not going to be possible to find healing here.  And then, a further theme, a further development of this theme, Cassandra says that she's, again, as she's walking in, Clytemnestra intends to shred me in abowl.  Now, for you and I, this might not sound like an obvious connection to medicine, but in antiquity, it absolutely would've been.  This is the normal way that drugs are delivered.  You take roots or other herbs, and shred them into a bowl, and mix them all together and this then becomes sort of drunk and potion, a potion that's ready for you to drink, and that's the mode by which drugs are normally delivered.  For her to say Clytemnestra intends to shred me into a bowl, would have been sounded like you and I saying, Clytemnestra intends to, you know, swallow me like a pill or something.  It would have been a clear and direct reference to medicine.  So, Cassandra here is making the death of Clytemnestra into some kind of a medicine that's going to cure this whole thing.  She is presumably going to now be having killed her.
 Clytemnestra will have exorcised her own guilt. And, yes, now this whole crime is going to be over.  At each time, at each turn in the development of the story, another generation treats the, the what they need to do as a kind of medicine that's going to cure the nastiness that's in this family.</p>
<p>When Agamemnon is out on his awful is outon his awful campaign and is lead, we find out by the Choral Ode, is led to this terrible event of having to kill his own daughter, Iphigenia.  He's told he must kill Iphigenia for the winds to get corrected.  He goes ahead and does it.  The killing of Iphigenia is referred to, yes indeed, as a pharmacon.  As if she is going to cure things in this story.  She's going to heal the winds and fix everything, that's line 200.  She's referred to as first for slaughter's kind of necessary.  A journey can get started and the war can be launched.  Well, no, she's not going to be a cure.  She's actually going to be a poison.  When she is killed, this event is what's going to absolutely poison Agememnon's own household.  </p>
<p>Clytemnestra will turn this against him which she obviously has every right to do.  Now Agamemnon also the story as it unfolds, makes contact with a lot of themes of purification.  This is harkening back to some of the events that we saw earlier in the tale of The House of Atreus.  But definitely brought home here in Aeschylus's version of the story.  Recall when Clytemnestra wants Agamemnon to come into the house, please, honey. I haven't seen you in so long.  Come in.  Let's give you a bath." We will purify you, we will clean you of all the nasty stuff that's going on out there in the war. And then, of course, this bath becomes a blood bath.</p>
<p>The idea that purification now actually leads to pollution is at yet another addition to our string of themes in which something thing is meant to cure or purify or fix things, also has the unintended side effect of undoing things, making them impure making them diseased.  And nets that are supposed to keep us together drive us apart.  Secrecy that's supposed to create intimacy actually creates wedges between us.  The Agamemnon shows the inversion of a lot of, very common themes of connection. We  get to see the utter and complete nastiness the dark side of intimacy.       </p>
<p>In this way, it's kind of a mirror of what we saw with Odysseus and Penelope where we saw the good sides of intimacy, here we get to see all the dark sides of it.  So focusing on these pieces and the themes as they get drawn out gives us a chance to see a sum of how Agamemnon pulls through this tale for his audience.</p>
