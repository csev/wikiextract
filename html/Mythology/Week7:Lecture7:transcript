<p>Introduction to the Eumenides</p>
<p>In the humanities we see the aftermath of Orestes' action; taking out his mother and her lover and trying to bring justice to his family by the old order of things.    </p>
<p>We remember in Homer how differently the story was portrayed. Remember it was Homer who held up Orestes as example of a young man that takes action even, when it is difficult.
 Well, sure he does that, but the focus that Aeschylus gives on the story is something quite a bit different. It is not as though we can rush to a race Orestes and say we should all be like that. Instead I think, watching Aeshcylus' play, we think to ourselves, my: goodness, what an awful savage situation to be in. Look here, poor Orestes, at the very beginning of the play as, we meet him, hugging the omphalos. 
He's just stuck there at Delphi trying to attach himself to it to make sure that he has some kind of protection.  That hugging of the omphalos is in connection with what we saw earlier in Homer's story, that getting hold of someone's knees, the contact that was involved there was thought to be protective. And in the getting a hold of the knees it was something where, someone actually owed you now hospitality, as a suppliant in their, in their eyes. 
And with Orestes getting hold of the omphalos, he now has protection. </p>
<p>The Furies are unable to get at him. You can see them in our depiction here, wonderfully on this vase. They are just laying around on the ground; they don't have enough to do. They can't get to him, because he's got himself in a safe position, having making contact with that stone, the omphalos.
 Recall where that came from, you know, from Hesiod, the story. This is supposedly in the tradition the actual stone that Cronus swallowed instead of Zeus. 
It was the supplemental stone at the end, it gets regurgitated up by Cronus and dropped right there in Delphi.
 So you can go to Delphi, and the stone, I showed you a slide earlier is actually still there. At least that's what the locals claim. This is the very same stone that was there in antiquity. That's what they claim and they claim also that Cronos had swallowed it. Who knows?
So Orestes we meet at the beginning of the play hugging the omphalos. The ghost of Clytemnestra is haunting him. We've got Apollo and Athena hovering around, trying to keep an eye on the
situation, trying to figure out what they're going to do next. In other words, we have the very top people in the universe have eye on this situation and are trying to solve things. 
The Furies and Apollo begin with a debate over justice: what counts as justice. The two of them have different ideas about it. There's a long interlude by the Furies as they slither around and give us their own strong, vociferous statements about how justice works, according to blood. </p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, the scene switches to Athens and we have straight, pretty straightforward court case. Athena comes in and addresses the furies.  The court case starts. We've got witnesses who come up, we got cross-examination. We have some statements by Aeschylus that are helping us understand how the court case is suppose to unfold or some kind of directions as to who goes, on how and how were going to count the votes and all these things.
 After the court case, we've got witnesses cross-examination and then the jury decides. But they're deadlocked so, Athena has to come in and solve the deadlock. She then decides in favors of Orestes.</p>
<p>The Furies at that point are upset because the court case is not decided in their favor and they threaten to scorch the earth. But the Olympians smartly figure out a way to give the Furies their due. They create a place of honor underneath the court, in the ground underneath it, and the play ends with a procession in honor of the Furies as they're marched into their new home, under the Athenian Acropolis.</p>
<p>At stake in this play is a set of ideas about justice. Two systems are being placed next to each other. The older order system of justice and a new one that you and I, as Athenians and classical Athenians watching this play. 
You and I are rightly proud of a new system of justice that we see emerging in our own democratic society. This is something that Aeschylus brings in to his play itself. Ideas of justice that are just emergent around the time he's writing this play, are written into the play, as a kind of a character, built into the story.
 Remember this old order of justice, based on concepts like miasma, we talked about earlier. Contact with evil blood makes evil rub off on you. If you have contact with that evil blood, the Furies come to get you. The strengths of this system are, that it's very clear, justice is going to be done, according to ties of blood. And if someone does have blood on their hands, then they're going to get punished. There's no way to kind of weasel your way out of it, or talk your way out of it. </p>
<p>Aeschylus talks about this with respect to this contact. It is a system that's based on contagion, contact, and blood. This is what makes this old system work. And it is thoroughly associated by Aeschylus with these Chthonic deities. You'll see I put the term up here. It's not, an obvious English word, but trust me. Those of you who are going to cocktail parties, that where the language that's being spoken happens to be in English. Just toss this word out. It makes you sound, you'll sound very literate.</p>
<p>Chtonic theaters, deities are those that are attached to the earth and we mentioned in our last video of Hesiod and the older order.
 Chthonic deities refers to all of those older order gods, including the Earth herself. The pre-Zeus, pre-Olympian layers of divine powers are stuck in there. 
Throughout the play, Aeschylus lines up this older order of justice with these Chthonic divinities. He talks about them consistently as being involved in it, being pulled out to enforce it. When Orestes and Electra are trying to figure out what to do in the libation bearer, as we mentioned in the last lecture, they appealed to these Chthonic divinities. 
The Furies themselves are representative of this older order of divinities. And when they speak, they consistently place the kind of justice that they're after, which is based on contagion and contact, and blood, against the Olympian order or the different orders of justice that are going to show up in this newer world.
 So the old order and the old system of justice make a counterpart to Olympian justice. This happens in lines 149 and 50, lines 162 to 67, 365, other places too, where the older order of things that the Chthonic gods lined up, with the idea of justice built into contact, contagion of blood, and all of that opposed to what the Olympians are up to.</p>
<p>I thought I'd bring out just one line here, the Fury speaking lines 731 to 733 in our translations we are using for the class.
 Since you, a young god, would ride down my elder age, I must stay here and listen to how the trial goes, being yet uncertain to loose my anger on the state. That's the statement of an old established divinity to a new young one, The Olympians, trying to say that what you all decide here is going to have an effect on me. But it's a, it's a system that this person, the Furies, speaking as a collective, are not quite ready to say they belong to or that belongs to them at all, some new structure. 
The, story, as we see it unfold, recall what happens after the Furies have the court case decided against them. Remember what happens to them.
 Just as in the case of Hesiod, when the Olympian gods overthrow the old order, and Zeus pushes them all under the Earth and closes them up down there. So, also at the end of Aeschylus' Oresteia, the older gods, here the Furies, are actually going to be interred, put under the earth, and put into now a temple, where we're going to give them honor and worship. 
This is slightly different than Hesiod locking them down in a jail. But it is Aeschylus finding a place, in the new order for the old order gods to have a role. The old system of, Fury, of justice enforced by the Furies had no way of dealing with the problems that were showing up in Agamemnon's family.
 The House of the Atreus was just stuck according to this older system of justice. It had a, it consistently was, you know, putting on the family irreconcilable obligations. Orestes is the figure that is focused on in this trilogy. He was, it had to, by what was counted, as being just by the laws of justice. He had to avenge his father. That was necessary for him.
 But at the same time, in order to avenge his father, he had to kill his mother. These, these are awful obligations and he knows, as well as anyone does, that this is a terrible act.
 The old system of justice have had no way of getting out of this cycle of retributive justice back and forth. Instead, what we have, is, a system that just closes in on itself. By the old order of justice, Atreus' house is doomed. 
Now there's something different that's going to happen in this second half of the play, When we turn to the trial set in Athens overseen by the Olympian deities, we are going to open up a discussion of a new kind of justice that is possible. And Aeshcylus is very cleverly, I think, portraying events and cultural forms that you and I, as classical Athenians, let's all pretend that we are classical Athenians for a second. You and I as classical Athenians have seen these forms of justice emerging, even in our own lifetimes, and now we say to ourselves: my goodness, well, this history that we are living is playing a role in the solving of mythic difficulties. A crime that was so troublesome, so difficult for ancient ideas of justice to take care of, is going to get solved by a contemporary institution of classical Athens. 
In the next segment, we'll start talking about how that idea of justice, the new idea of justice, centered on classical Athens, comes into Aeschylus' play to solve an otherwise absolutely insoluble problem.</p>
