<li><p>Host of this curriculum Perry Mehrling is author of <i>The New Lombard Street</i> - a title that refers to <i>Lombard Street</i> by Walter Bagehot - in many insiders view the greatest economist ever to edit The Economist. Of course, greatest is a system value design judgement. Back In 1843 the purpose and values of The Economist were defined as mediating leading decision-makers of The Industrial revolution with the goals of ending hunger and ending capital abuse of youth.

<blockquote>
  <p>George Soros with his super bubble hypothesis has perhaps the most expansive sense of what has ended but his analysis is of but a piece</p>
  <p>As a historian of monetary and financial economics, I recognise this entire line of commentary as continuous with the great tradition of British central banking thought going back at least to Watler Bagehot's Lombard Street.  In this regard, I would note Ralph Hawtry's emphasis on the inherent instability of credit - a phrase he used to emphasise the weakness of self-regulatory forces in the money market and the consequent need for active central bank management . Today's new twist is the suggestion that central banks have become part fo the problem by helping inflate bubbles: by keeping interest rates too low and then by preventing the subsequent collapse from claaring out the bad credit so that each subsequent bubble gets built on shakier financial foundations than the previous one. In this talk I would like to observe mistaken monetary theory- the problem I suggest is that central bankers have been listening too much to academics rather than their own rather different intellectual tradition.. I will refer to this indigenous practitioners intellectual tradition as The Money View to distinguish it for the academic economics view and the academic finance view both of which determinedly abstract from the monetary plumbing behind the wall in order to focus on other matters  ,,, more at
