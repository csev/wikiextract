<p><b>EURODOLLAR MARKET</b>
<dl><dd> The world unsecured funding market in dollars used by global money dealers(banks). Does show up on balance sheet, c.f. Fed Funds market, which is a brokered system which doesn't. The irate charged is the LIBOR. The market is vulnerable to liquidity because it lacks access to the Fedâ€™s balance sheet so they line up the in/out flows in time to minimize reserves. Also see FRA.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p><b>EURODOLLARS</b>
<dl><dd> Dollar balances held by banks (money dealers) outside the US, which banks hold no reserves at the Fed and consequently have no direct access to settlement through Fedwire thus Eurodollar balances settle on the private CHIPS network.</p>

</dd></dl>

<p><b>FED FUNDS MARKET</b>
<dl><dd>Centred in NYC. The market where banks lend and borrow from each other; typically overnight loans.

During business hours the Fed trades in the Repo market, adjusting the country's credit, using the targeted Federal Funds rate as a benchmark for the repo (reverse repo) rate.  During evening hours, the Federal Funds Market, using the repo rate as a benchmark for the effective Federal Funds rate. The effective rate (no collateral) will usually be slightly higher than the repo rate (collateralized).  The next day, the FOMC will review results from the previous day to see how well the effective rate met the targeted rate, and the Repo Rate "dance" starts all over again.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p><b>FIP</b>
<dl><dd> Forward Interest Parity. [1+R(0,2)] [1+R(2,5)] = [1+R(0,5)], where R is the LIBOR.</p>

</dd></dl>

<p><b>OUTSIDE SPREAD</b>
<dl><dd>&#160;?</p>
</dd></dl>

<p><b>REPO, RP</b>
<dl><dd> Repurchase agreement. A short term secured lending agreement whereby a security is loaned and repurchased at a later date for a higher amount representing the interest desired.  Also, used when the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) wants to adjust the country's money supply by way of adjusting the level of credit. To increase credit during a recession, the FOMC will loan funds to specific Treasury Dealers offering treasuries as collateral which is deposited (credited) to the dealers' banks, which will cause funds to be available for loans to the general public.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p><b>REVERSE REPO</b>
<dl><dd> Same as the REPO transaction except that you are on lending side of the transaction.</p>
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>

<p><b>UCIP</b>
<dl><dd> Uncovered Interest Parity.  Connection btw $ interest rates and interest rates in other currencies that shows up in exchange rates.  Economist thinks this makes sense and should be true, however, this connection fails all the time so current formula expressing this are not valid and the theory itself may not be valid also.  [Prof thinks it has to do with deep issues in monetary economics relating to liquidity and the price of liquidity so the money view is essential in figuring out these asset price anomalies.]</p>
</dd></dl>

<p><b>VOLCKER RULE</b>
<dl><dd> Necessity of matched book.</p>
</dd></dl>
