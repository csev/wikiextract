<p>We hope you all had a relaxing holiday and a happy new year!</p>
<p>There have been several updates in the GTC in the past months and some of us might have not been informed of these changes because we currently don't receive any newsletters (not unless we subscribed to each thread to receive anything that has been posted recently or regularly check the forums). The following is the list of what I have noticed in the discussion forums that are, I think, of importance.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Regarding recognition: </p>
<p>a. several ideas for recognition have been suggested in this thread: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=827">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=827</a></p>
<p>b. 100% free signature track voucher for every 25,000 words translated have been issued. The voucher is not transferrable. It has generally an expiration date but maybe replaced with another voucher if unused. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=857#post-7346">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=857#post-7346</a></p>
<p>c. "When I've translated 25000 words, how long should I wait to receive a voucher?" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=857">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=857</a></p></li>
<li><p>Approved for translation lists of courses... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjHjzg6ZDHaedEhFUk5abHVKY1I1XzhfRmlrTjZYV3c#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjHjzg6ZDHaedEhFUk5abHVKY1I1XzhfRmlrTjZYV3c#gid=0</a></p>
<p>a. has been recently updated last December with some sidenotes on each courses (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=494#post-7240">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=494#post-7240</a>)</p>
<p>b. has yellow and red highlights before but have new been removed since they don't signify anything (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=494#comment-8649">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=494#comment-8649</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Videos in Transifex:</p>
<p>a. Some courses now have videos properly playing  and Claude Almansi have observed that these involved those  courses part of JHU's specialization. List of courses with videos on this thread: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=494#comment-8487">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=494#comment-8487</a> [1]</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestion to have an (informal) Google Hangout soon (by January of February) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=872">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=872</a></p>
<p>a. List of possible themes to be discussed  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=872#post-7383">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=872#post-7383</a></p>
<p>b. We can also invite those communities who doesn't have a LC yet so that they will be kept posted and their voices be heard as well.</p>
<p>c. Should it be scheduled on a Saturday? </p></li>
<li><p>Bulk back-up/download srt files- instructions on this link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=849">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/thread?thread_id=849</a></p></li>
<li><p>Subtitles that were translated in Amara.org when Coursera had a team there are being used presently in some course platforms, but not on Transifex: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/tag?id=177">https://class.coursera.org/translations-001/forum/tag?id=177</a> . GTC volunteers should be given a list of the concerned Amara subtitling pages, lest they retranslate already translated subtitles.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>[1] Actually, this is the URL of a 2014-12-24 comment that gave the list of the JHU courses that were the only ones to appear in the list of approved courses, viewed "straight", back then. Unfortunately, not all these courses have the player enabled. Maybe Coursera staff could tell us where they have enabled it, both in the GTC public forums, and also in a "From admins" part to be added to this announcement?</p>
