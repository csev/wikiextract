<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_4A:_Inheritance.3F">Lecture 4A: Inheritance?</span></h2>
<p>Slide with numbers on inheritance (1:30). There appears to be a (strong) link between inheritance and depression. There might be a link based on a cultural aspects, but belief it is genetics. (zandi et al, public mental health)
In 1-eiige tweelingen 53% both have a depression. 
About 43% of all depressions seems to be (partially) caused by inheritance.
Not been able yet to find the genes responsible for depression
'missing heritability' → we know it heritable but haven't been able to find it 
(manhattan plot, looks like manhattan)</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_4B:_Stress_.26_Diathesis">Lecture 4B: Stress &amp; Diathesis</span></h2>
<p>Difference between patients (people that receive some treatment) and cases (number of people who never receive treatments)</p>
<p>Gene environment interaction. When people do no have a significant life event they have little risk of a depression. Combined with inheritance this shows that eeneiige twins who have a twin with depression and suffering a life event have a much higher chance of depression than either the twin without a life event, and than a twin who's duplicate doesn't have a depression.</p>
<p>The combination of environment (stress) and genes brings on a depression. If you're more neurotic (easily stressed) you're more likely to get a depression. Combine this with high stress and it almost has to go wrong. </p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_4C:_Social_Supports">Lecture 4C: Social Supports</span></h2>
<p>Confidant: Someone you can talk to no matter what the problem is. About 80% of the people have someone like that. </p>
<p>The “stress-buffering” hypothesis (percent with onset of disorder)</p>
<p>Social support buffers the risk of stress. 
Low social support is riskier for women than for men. For men social support isn't very relevant. 
Gender argument → culturally 
Sex argument → Evolutionary reasons. 
There's no clear answer yet. </p>
<p><em>Summary:</em>
<ul><li> Stress increases risk for depressive disorder
</li><li> Social supports are protective from depressive disorder
</li><li> Stress and social supports interact in affecting risk
</li><li> inherited traits interact with stress in raising risk
</li><li> Low social support is riskier for females</p>
</li></ul>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_4D:_Work.2C_Family_and_life_stage">Lecture 4D: Work, Family and life stage</span></h2>
<p>Forest plot → Way to combine info of a lot of different researches. </p>
<p>Life stage is hardly of influence on depression, except for people (women?) with children under 14, possibly due to job strain (low decision latitude, high psychological demand).</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_4E:_Recency_of_Birth:_Are_we_entering_an_.E2.80.9Cage_of_melancholy.E2.80.9D">Lecture 4E: Recency of Birth: Are we entering an “age of melancholy”</span></h2>
<p>Births before 1935 have a lower chance of depression. 
Possible explanations:
<ul><li> People with depression die sooner (might have some effect, but seems not a strong connection)
</li><li> Older cohorts are less introspective (may not be willing to talk about it, not be aware about it themselves)
</li><li> More treatment availability leads to better recall (diagnosis) 
</li><li> Older subjects forget more distant episodes</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Shows there might really be an age of melancholy. </p>
<p>Possibly:
Decline of informal social connections (eating together, entertaining, went to home of friends, etc)</p>
<p>It seems like not more new cases of depression, but cases with depression stay depressed for longer.</p>
<p><em>Summary</em>
<ul><li> Does not seem like we're entering an age of melancholy
</li><li> Appearance of large trends for higher prevalence in later cohorts is probably at least partly an artifact of recall
</li><li> Evidence on trends in rise in incidence is limited, but suggest there has not been a rise in incidence in the past half century
</li><li> There is evidence for a rise in prevalence for women in cohorts born about 1935-1954
</li><li> Women born in 1935-1945 entered work and married life in 1955-1974
</li><li> These cohorts of females may have greater chronicity of depression than earlier or later cohorts
</li><li> Trends in social supports and divorce may be connected to trends in chronicity of depression for women.</p>
</li></ul>
