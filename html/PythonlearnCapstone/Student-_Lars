					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>I am working with data from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://data.worldbank.org/">http://data.worldbank.org/</a>. The site has a reasonably functional API and contains time series data of some 1400 indicators for 250 countries and regions. The wealth of data is a little overwhelming, so at the start I have focused on getting data into an SQLlite database (mostly for convenience as right now there is only one table). Right now, I am looking at a few indicators to visualize as bubble/scatter plots. Would be great if I could figure out how to make the indicator selection dynamic and include the time dimension as animation.</p>
<p>Either way, it's lots of fun, slightly addictive and incredibly educational.</p>
