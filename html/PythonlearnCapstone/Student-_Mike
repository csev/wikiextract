					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>As an avid gamer and someone who works in the computer games industry I was attracted to data involving computer games and the communities which grow around them. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> is one of the biggest distributors of PC games whose members congregate into groups. The platform also provides a wealth of data through its API about these members, should they choose, its groups and games. </p>
<p>I plan on making a program which will do the following (subject to tweaking)</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user to enter the name or id of a group on steam (for instance the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/pcgamer/">PCGamer group</a></li>
<li>Allow the user to select how many of the members of the group will have their information pulled (perhaps limit it to around 1000 max) </li>
<li>Pull the information about the members, including which games they have in their library</li>
<li>Produce a visual representation of the most popular games owned</li>
</ul>
<p>Its a fairly simply program (hopefully). But the wealth of information allowed through the Steam API means there is certainly room for expansion (assuming I manage to achieve the above). </p>
<p>Comments/Feedback about this idea are welcome.</p>
<p>-Michael</p>
