					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>I want to design a survey for our school Teachers to figure out their achievements and milestones on daily basis in regards to Student behavior; Academics; Communication among Faculty and Staff; Communication with Parents and probably some more relevant data. I'm reading Primer sources to design good surveys. I want to make it simple to teachers to enter responses quickly and daily. I'll use Javascrip to create an app (access at the end of the school day on their phone.) I envision data to go to a Google Sheets (use Google Forms; Sheets with Flubaroo). I want to be able to use Python to read that data on weekly or monthly basis and store it into a Database. Then, use Sql on the database to generate monthly reports that are relevant to our school and will serve for decision making. I suspect that towards the end of the year, things might get really interesting. My hope is that it might ignite a conversation to take action if necessary. The KEY thing as always is making sure the teachers perceive it as useful and very user friendly so that they incorporate it into they daily routine painlessly.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to join me in this effort. Please, add to this post. thank you.</p>
