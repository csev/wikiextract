					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Detractors of Evolution sometimes say it is "just a theory", and pressure legislators to introduce bills to "teach the controversy". </p>
<p>Yes, Evolution is a theory, but a theory in science is different than the informed guess implied in everyday speech. A scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment" (Wikipedia). As all science is provisional, absolute proof is not considered possible. Disproving theories is allowed (or encouraged) and a theory that is not testable is "not even wrong" (Wolfgang Pauli). A scientific theory should be able to make predictions, sometimes in areas completely unexpected and not directly related to the theory itself. </p>
<p>There is also no controversy. Like global warming, there is political and social debate about Evolution, but no scientific doubt about anything but the details.</p>
