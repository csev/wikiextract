					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>A very common misconception of the theory of evolution is the claim that it tries to explain the origin or even the meaning of life. </p>
<p>It is true that many scientific areas of study overlap or blur into one another. For example where physics stops chemistry begins and where chemistry stops biology starts. Evolution is one of many branches of biology. However it only concerns itself with the study of how life changes through time over successive generations. It doesn't pose or attempt to answer the question of how or why life began. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">Abiogenesis</a> is the study of the process of how life can arise from non-organic material.</p>
<p>There is also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology">astrobiology</a> which studies the origins, evolution and the future of life on Earth and in the rest of the universe.</p>
