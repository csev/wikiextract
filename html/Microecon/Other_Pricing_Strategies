<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bundling_.26_Two-Part_Tariffs">Bundling &amp; Two-Part Tariffs</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are two prevalent strategies discussed in this video.   They are bundling and two-part tariff pricing strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bundling:_Occurs_when_a_company_forces_you_to_buy_packages_of_a_good.2C_service_or_item."><strong>Bundling:</strong>  Occurs when a company forces you to buy packages of a good, service or item.</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>There were two primary examples given, software and cable television.  With software you are usually presented a bundle of software at one set price.  The same with cable television where you are offered several programming packages in a bundle.</p></li>
<li><p>The example in the video went through how bundling generates a profit from two subscribers.  If they chose individual packages that were valued at the lowest value, individually they wouldn't make as much money as they would bundled.  </p></li>
<li><p>Bundling increases the revenue of a company because it allows the company to capture more of the consumer's willingness to pay (WTP).  </p></li>
<li><p>When you have asymmetric demand for content, services or goods, where there are consumers who are willing to pay a lot for one good with other consumers willing to pay very little for the same good, and vice versa,  bundling generates more revenue.</p></li>
<li><p>The company is trying to get at the maximum willingness to pay by forcing customers to take good/services that they otherwise wouldn't take.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Two-Part_Tariff:_Occurs_when_you_are_charged_both_an_entrance_fee_and_then_a_per_quantity_fee.">Two-Part Tariff: Occurs when you are charged both an entrance fee and then a per quantity fee.</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The three primary examples were 1)Amusement Parks, 2)Health Clubs and 3)Cellular Phone Services</p></li>
<li><p><em>Amusement Parks:</em>
Two-Part Tariff structure occurs when you pay an entrance fee into the park, and then a per-use fee to ride rides, enjoy games or attend events.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Gym/Health Club:</em>
Here the two-part tariff structure occurs when you pay a membership fee to join and then a monthly fee to use the facilities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cellular Phone</em> Service:
The two-part tariff structure occurs when you are charged for a certain amount of minutes during a monthly period.  After the certain amount of monthly minutes are used, you are then charged for any additional usage over the maximum limit.</p></li>
<li><p>In the video a graph was presented that illustrated consumer surplus over the price and up to the maximum willingness to pay (WTP).  Anything over the price and up to the maximum willingness to pay is considered consumer surplus.  So the two-part tariff scheme is designed to leech out as much of the consumer surplus as possible.</p></li>
