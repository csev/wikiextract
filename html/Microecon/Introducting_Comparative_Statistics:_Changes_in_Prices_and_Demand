<p>Comparative statistics are when economists look at a particular situation during one point, then suggest a change. Economists then use tools to evaluate what that change will be.</p>
<p>When the <b>price</b> of the good changes, the demand for that <i>quantity</i> changes, however the actual <i>demand</i> does not change. This can be illustrated by the demand curve where a increase or decrease in price results in movement along the curve. The structure does not change.</p>
<p>For example, say the price of tomatoes is $6. What would happen if the price of tomatoes increased to $8 (assuming everything else stays the same)? The result is a reduction of quantity of tomatoes demanded. When price of goods changes, the quantity demanded changes.</p>
<p>Q. What if the price of the tomatoes increases? 
A. The quantity demanded goes down
Q. If the price changes does the demand change? 
A. No, only the quantity demanded changes. Another way to say the same thing is that the consumption changed but the value of the tomatoes didnâ€™t change. 
(both of these questions assume that everything else stays the same) - Dana</p>
<p>Keep in mind to remember the differences between a change in Quantity Demanded (QD) versus a change in Demand (D). A change in QD is moving along the actual line, while a change in D is a shift of the line (whether up or down depends on the determinant of demand). - Diego A.</p>
