<p>o   What is the effect on market price and market quantity if the price of gasoline increases AND there is bad weather (simultaneous change in demand and supply)?</p>
<p>•   Gasoline prices increase, price of tomatoes increase and the quantity (supply) of tomatoes decreases. That demand is spread to fewer suppliers who can charge a higher price.</p>
<p>•   Now bad weather brings down the demand (not as many consumers at the farmers market). The price decreases and the quantity decreases.</p>
<p>•   Price: we don’t know (demand is pushing prices down, while supply is pushing them up)</p>
<p>•   When demand and supply decrease simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity falls but the change in equilibrium price is ambiguous/unknown unless we have more information.</p>
<p>•   Let’s look at the model: the interception of D’ and S’ (red lines) gives smaller quantity (4) for the same price (6); but that’s just a case. We don’t know the degree of the shift. We can conclude that quantity is for sure smaller (to the left of D curve), but we don’t know if prices will be higher (between 6 and 8) or lower (less than 6) - NB I made my own graph with these values and it seems to work</p>
<p>•   We don’t have a full explanatory power as before</p>
