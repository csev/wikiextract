<p>Externalities - they are causing a cost that others have to pay.</p>
<p>2 main characteristics of externalities:
<br />    1. An agent engages in an activity which changes the welfare of another agent
<br />    2. The change in welfare goes uncompensated.</p>
<p>If one adds the negative externality costs (e.g. polution costs) to the supply curve (e.g. production of electricity), then the supply curve shifts to the left and the equilibrium price of the good is higher, while the quantity produced is lower. So, for example, by incorporating the pollution costs in the price of electricity production, it would make that less electricity is produced in equilibrium and that the cost of it is higher. This would be good in the sense that otherwise " too much electricity" is being produced, causing bad pollution costs. But if the negative externalities are not incorporated in the price (if companies do not have to pay for them), then too much of the product will be used/made.</p>
