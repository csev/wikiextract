<p>We continued on with the idea of the long-run supply curve (LRSC).</p>
<p>There was an assumption that the lowest point on the ATC (Average Total Cost) curve doesn't change regardless of any change in the market.  This is an overreaching assumption.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="There_are_actually_three_types_of_change_in_industries.">There are actually three types of change in industries.</span></h2>
<p>A) Constant Cost Industry:
An industry where regardless of the number of added firms, the cost remains the same.
<ul><li> LRSC is sloped zero (prices will return to equilibrium regardless of number of firms)
</li></ul>

<p><br />
B) Decreasing Cost Industry:
An industry where adding new firms to the total number of firms, decreases the costs.
<ul><li> LRSC is sloped downwards
</li><li> Example: Computers, TV (more companies gives firms more incentive to produce more effectively)</p>
</li></ul>

<p><br />
C) Increasing Cost Industry:
An industry where adding new firms leads to an increase in costs.
<ul><li> LRSC is sloped upwards
</li><li> Example: Oil (any industry where the resource is limited and/or it is difficult to obtain the commodity)</p>
</li></ul>
