<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notes_for_Week_2:_6.1._Demand_and_Supply_Conclusion">Notes for Week 2: 6.1. Demand and Supply Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>We can try to answer original question "Why tomatoes cost more on farmers market than in supermarket?", using supply (S) and demand (D) model.</p>
<p>One of the explanations from the demand side is that people value farmers market tomatoes more because:
-   There is direct contact with producer, buyer can find out how the vegetables were grown etc
-   Local product, that has not traveled too far from unknown destination and of unknown growing methods, which is also likely to be better for the environment
-   Money stays in local economy, the region benefits from it
-   Freshness and good taste of the products </p>
<p>Thus there might be more D for farmers market tomatoes than tomatoes in grocery stores, so D curve of market tomatoes is to the right as compared to D curve for store tomatoes, thus price higher. </p>
<p>From supply side explanation could be that farmers are small scale producers, no economy of scale, they use simpler technologies, so it is more expensive to produce tomatoes for local farmers etc. Thus S curve is to the left as compared to S curve of grocery store =&gt; price higher.</p>
<p>The power of S&amp;D model is that it helps to organize thinking when trying to answer any economic questions.</p>
