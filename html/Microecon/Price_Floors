Price floors: Set the price so that it can not go any lower.</p>
<p>•   Example: minimum wage (introduced in the ‘30s, with the New Deal; concept behind it: worker is selling his labor, that is worker is giving a supply)</p>
<p>o   The equilibrium price is $ 5 per hour</p>
<p>o   The government sets a minimum at $ 7.25 per hour</p>
<p>o   As a result, the number of available jobs (=demand for jobs) will decrease, from $$Q&#95;1$$ to $$Q&#95;3$$, while the workers willing to work (=supply of workers) will increase, from $$Q&#95;1$$ to $$Q&#95;2$$.  A Surplus of workers is created, thus unemployment.</p>
<p>o   The situation might be worse: the ones employed are better off, but there are many more unemployed ($$Q&#95;1$$ - $$Q&#95;3$$ are workers laid off due to higher price of workers)</p>
<p>o   The case is similar to the tomatoes in the storage: there is a surplus (8 – 4 = 4), therefore wages should decrease</p>
<p>o   Market cannot work this way if wages are not allowed to decrease for a government policy</p>
<p>o   Again, options are black market or similar</p>
<hr />
<p>•   Minimum wage can have no effect if it’s below the equilibrium point (for example, 6 is equilibrium, 4 is set as minimum)</p>
<hr />
<p>•   Another price floor that is very famous in the US is the price floor for agricultural resources like corn and milk</p>
<p>o   The government wants to maintain these industries in the country because they control the food supply of the country</p>
<p>o   Then we actually help those farmers by making sure that they can earn enough by selling their products so they don't have to face competition from other countries</p>
<p>o   The government basically pays the farmers enough so that the price or demand of milk or corn doesn't go down</p>
<p>o   This price is quite high, so price can actually go down because of competition from abroad and internationally</p>
<p>o   Whenever there is a surplus, the government buys it and destroys it, because, if the surplus goes back into the circulation, the prices would go down</p>
<hr />
<p>•   Generally, price ceilings are more common than price floors</p>
