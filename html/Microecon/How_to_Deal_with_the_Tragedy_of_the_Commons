<p>*Issue with common resources-No property rights.</p>
<p>*To solve the problem, it requires granting/transfering property rights and controlling the access for it. Give rights to the community and the community as a whole will use the resource more effectively and sustainably. Relying on the business will result in less efficient use of the resources and focus only on production and profit.</p>
<p>Examples: 
<br />
<ul><li>Quotas given to fishing communities that allows the fisheries to be used in a sustainable and efficient way. 
</li><li>In US, there are hunting and fishing licenses given out. 
</li><li>Tolls on particular roads/bridges to reduce congestion. However, tolls can be politically contentious. Tolls rates are based on level of congestion of the arterials. This has been successful in Texas. However, there have been complaints.</p>
</li></ul>
