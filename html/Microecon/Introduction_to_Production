<p>How the Improvements (Innovation) in Production Increase the Value and Welfare?</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Technology:">Technology:</span></h2>
<p><i>For example the dropping of prices and the quality increase in laptop computers</i></p>
<ul>
<li>In the lecture Dr. Vasquez cited his own experience purchasing a laptop with 1GB of storage.  He paid a price of $2200 for it.</li>
<li>In 13 years, he saw the size of storage increase and the price decrease.</li>
<li>He paid $1000 for his Ultrabook with a much larger storage capacity.  </li>
<li>He also cited his iphone costing $200 with a storage of 8GB as well as an USB drive which were quite cheap and contained considerably more storage than his 1998 laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_main_questions_answered_in_this_week_are:">The main questions answered in this week are:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>How are things produced?</li>
<li>What inputs are needed for production?</li>
<li>How do these inputs combine?</li>
<li>How is productivity affected for <em>so many</em> <em>workers</em> in the production line?</li>
<li>How does this effect the cost of production?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Production and Costs</em> are in close relation because the inputs have costs that impact the production price for the goods or services that are produced.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Key_concept:">Key concept:</span></h2>
<p>Survival of the fittest borrowed from the biological theory of Charles Darwin.  Business that succeed in production and sales do so because they are more suited for survival than their competitors.</p>
