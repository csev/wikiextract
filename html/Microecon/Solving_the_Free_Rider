<p>Advertising-advertisers pay for advertising eg. during TV shows on Free-to-air TV, information on Google. They also pay for the programming over the airwaves. Some people complain about excess advertising, but basically the market satisfactorily provides for television and radio programming. </p>
<p>For goods like national defence,highways,fire protection,public education etc. the main way of solving free-rider problem is forcing people to pay for the good through taxation, as it is for the benefit of the people.</p>
<p>Question for the government-How much to provide?
eg: Traffic lights. Even though everyone agrees that traffic lights improve traffic management, the government finds it difficult to evaluate the benefits of the traffic light (saving lives) against the costs. They have to put value on things that clearly can't be traded on the market (value of human life) and have to do cost-benefit analysis. Should a city put a street light on every corner? But what of the costs? Even though lives are priceless there needs to be a balance that includes the costs. How much is enough? In some evaluations governments have placed a value of $10 million on the value of human lives.</p>
<p>Most economists will agree that public goods will not be distributed in the most efficient way, because of the cost-benefit analysis that the government has to conduct in an ad-hoc way.</p>
