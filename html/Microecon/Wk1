<p>2) Marginal benefits and costs: don't use the average cost or benefit in a decision, use the marginal cost - the next cost that would be incurred or benefit to be derived.</p>
<p>3) Invisible hand: people acting individually yields better result for all society; example 1 is prices to motivate behaviors, example 2 is people in lines at the supermarket.</p>
<p>4) Trade creates value: items have different value for different people at different times. If we trade to line these up, value is created (seemingly out of nowhere).</p>
