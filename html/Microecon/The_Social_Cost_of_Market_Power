<ul>
<li><p>Are there any problems with Market Power when a company has complete or partial power in a market?</p></li>
<li><p>There was a graph in the video that illustrated the differences in prices in a monopoly based market which was then compared to a market with perfect competition.  </p></li>
<li><p>The end result is that the monopoly produces less quantity at a higher price. The difference between the quantity in a perfectly competitive market and the quantity in a market where there is a monopoly is the social cost.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>However, no one gets surpluses from the gains of a monopoly from trades that were not made.</em> </p></li>
<li><p><em>Price discrimination can allow monopolies to offer more goods at varying prices thus reducing social cost because more people can now afford the good.</em></p></li>
