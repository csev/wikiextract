<ul>
<li>Another way to view opportunity cost is to consider what am I losing by not choosing the best alternative.  Using the example from the class lecture, if I attend the Clapton concert (which I could attend for free, $0), instead of attending the Dylan concert (which would cost me $40, but I value at $50), then I've lost the opportunity realize/gain the value in participating in an activity/consume goods (i.e. see the Dylan concert) at a cost ($40) which is less than what I value it as ($50). - Diana Henderson</li>
</ul>
<p>*So, basically, by going to the free Clapton concert, you are denying yourself the opportunity to enjoy something that cost you $10 fewer dollars that you were willing to pay for it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An "Opportunity lost is an Opportunity Cost". Opportunity Cost is the value of the best forgone alternative between two or more alternatives. When you choose more of one alternative, you lose the opportunity (which cost you) to receive more of the other alternative. </p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity cost is the value of the next best available activity in comparison to the activity chosen.</p></li>
<li><p>Put in other words, opportunity costs are the net value of the activity that you forgo while performing some other activity (Let's call it Activity X). It is not the net value of all other possible activities that the individual can engage in when not doing Activity X, but the value of the next best alternative. </p></li>
<li><p>In the professor's words, the opportunity cost is the <i>value of the next best choice/alternative that is given up to engage in the activity or exchange you desire the more/most</i> - <i> Arka Purkayastha</i></p></li>
<li><p>The presumed dollar value and the actual dollar cost of an alternative are the essential elements of an opportunity cost. Only by placing values on concerts and only if ticket prices are lower than the presumed values are gains possible. If all tickets are free then no gain is possible by choosing one concert over another. â€“ Dorian Smith</p></li>
<li><p>For example, you get three alternatives to choose from: taking an economics class; taking a piano lesson;, or having a short nap. Your aim for choosing any alternative is to maximize your total knowledge. If you end up taking the economics class, your opportunity cost is the <strong>"knowledge from the piano lesson"</strong> and not "refreshments from the short nap" or "piano lesson knowledge + feeling refreshed from the short nap".</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of the Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton concerts example, the (net) value of the Dylan concert to us is $50 (price you are willing to pay to attend the concert) - $40 (the price of the ticket of the concert) = $10. This (net) value is the opportunity cost. The (net) value of the Clapton concert is irrelevant to the opportunity cost as we are looking at just the value of the next best alternative, not the value in comparison to the option chosen.</p></li>
<li><p>"The opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone, in a situation in which a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives given limited resources. Assuming the best choice is made, it is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would be had by taking the second best choice available.[1] The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as 'the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.' Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing 'the basic relationship between scarcity and choice'" -- Wikipedia</p></li>
<li><p>For conclusion, I would state that the value part in the cost of opportunity definition, is in fact a benefit. A benefit lost for not incurring in the forgone option. It ends up being more a comparison of benefits than actual (subjective because individual) perceived values. - Vasco Cavaco</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing what opportunity cost is helps you make a better decision when choosing between mutually exclusive alternatives because you know in advance how choosing one of the alternatives affects, for better or worse, the outcome of not choosing the other alternatives. It is a way to ensure resources are used efficiently. - Salvador Gallegos Almaguer.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity cost is the cost we pay when we give up something to get something else. There can be many alternatives that we give up to get something else, but the opportunity cost of a decision is the most desirable alternative we give up to get what we want. - Jumoke Akhator.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity cost are the options/benefit(s) forfeited in pursuit of the selected and perceived most favorable option. It's a function of analyzing options to select the discerned best option. - Sholape Iyoho</p></li>
<li><p>Our decisions and our preferences invariably lie on the opportunity costs that we have to come across, and the constant need to ponder over our decisions so as to envisage maximum benefits. - Deep Maity</p></li>
<li><p>To understand the concept of Opportunity Cost, we must think in terms of VALUE not cost... - Enrique Palacios</p></li>
<li><p>Value (whether subjective or objective) is definitely the primary concept behind the principal of opportunity cost.  When presented with multiple options, it would be the quantity/figure/cost/value potentially gained would you have selected the next best option. - Jose Neftali Ramirez</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity cost can be confusing if one relates it to value, however it is a value that one is willing to give up in order to gain something else. - Ntshengedzeni Negovha</p></li>
<li><p>The definition of opportunity costs is very simple: it is the value of the alternative not chosen. In this way opportunity costs becomes a very important factor in the world economy. It helps us to understand what we really need and what we really what.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to know how much the opportunity cost is,you must think carefully about all the costs and saves. For the case in this lesson, choose not to attending the Dylan concert will save me $40.So the opportunity cost is not that much,that means: $50-$40=$10.--Charlie ZH</p></li>
<li><p>In order to understand opportunity costs, we must understand preferences first since the definition says it's the next best thing foregone while making a choice. 
Say I have 3 feasible options and by this I refer what I could compare between the options/choices. Say I went along with plan 1 and refused plan 2 &amp; 3. This clearly means that I preferred plan 1 over 2 and 3 and now to make an evaluation of my choice, I would compare the lost opportunity to the one I preferred.
plan 1= go to baseball match
plan 2= sit &amp; study microeconomics
plan 3= go on date with my girl.<br />
Now having made plan 1 as choice I have lost the opportunity to execute other 2 plans. Since the time is consumed in watching baseball match, now the OPPORTUNITY COST OF THE TIME which I utilised watching baseball is the lost utility from next best alternative which I think is so. Now again take a look
plan 1= 20 utils of utility
plan 2= 36 utils
plan 3= 25 utils 
So if I choose plan 1, and my preference ranking is like plan1&gt;plan3&gt;plan2 then the opportunity cost of my decision is 36 utils of utility, which I choose to forgo by not going on date with my girl. Now since consumers are assumed rational, this example may seem unusual but remember opportunity cost as a notion is not to confirm to rationality assumption. Otherwise consumers choose best alternative among the feasible options and here it would have been plan 2 and the opportunity cost would have been 25 utils i.e plan 2 would have next best consumption bundle(consuming time). - Nitish kashyap</p></li>
<li><p>Per my understanding the best alternative to Clapton concert is Dylan's. And as per my personal valuation, I am willing to pay 50 bucks to use this opportunity versus to the actual cost of 40 bucks for the concert, I would lose $10 based on my presumption. And since Dylan's concert is the only alternative for me instead of the free concert by Clapton, the opportunity cost in this case is directly $10! Gaurab Bhuyan</p></li>
<li><p>Most times, your value for something you like is more than the cost you are willing to pay for that thing. Opportunity cost is the difference between the value (in monetary terms) you are willing to pay and the cost to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity Cost mathematically is weighed against the best option only.  The cost of the best option versus the value of the best option.  This net difference is your foregone opportunity cost.  It is not a net comparative cost difference of your multiple options.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity Cost is the value of the of the options not chosen. In the example given, if I want to go see Bob Dylan for $40, but I was willing to pay $50, I save $10 by not attending the Eric Clapton concert I would have otherwise gone to for free. If I chose to attend the Eric Clapton concert, I would miss out by saving the $10. -Leah, Minnesota</p></li>
<li><p>Basically, opportunity cost is the value of the thing you gave up in exchange for another activity. This opportunity cost is usually the value of the next best alternative -- assuming that the one you traded it off for is the better option than the other. For example, the problem in the video goes like this: you win a free ticket for an Eric Clapton concert, but then there is also a Bob Dylan concert which is given as the next best alternative. You are willing to pay 50$ for Dylan when it merely costs 40$. By choosing Clapton, your opportunity cost becomes 10$ because you "lose" the 10$ you could have saved watching Bob Dylan whom you value at 50$. - adg</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity Cost is the value we place on an object or activity relative to the actual cost of said object/activity. Ross B.</p></li>
<li><p>In Microeconomic theory, opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone, particularly in situations in which a choice needs to be made between several alternatives, given limited resources. - Diego A.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity Cost is the difference of what I would like to do and what IÂ´m doing. </p></li>
<li><p>The difference between the value and the cost of the second best option while making a decision - Atlas</p></li>
<li><p>The Opportunity Cost is not always a number. In fact, and in addition, there is a psychological cost of knowing that another choice could generate a higher payoff but its missed. Depending on who is taking the choice, it could be more important or not.

<li><p>Someone is give up to see a movie to study for a test in order to get a good grade. The opportunity cost is the cost of the movie and enjoyment of seeing it. It's more than a black and white situation. Usually the decision contains personal value. If the lesson what you're studing for is not so related to your goals, but in those days you're very stressed and a little take-off time is needed, but your grades overall need to be high, the opportunity cost going to be 'wider". - L.P</p></li>
</ul>
<p>*Opportunity Cost is something given up in order to obtain another item, it's usually more valuable than the thing given up.
Origin of the Concept of Opportunity Cost: The Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser coined the concept of opportunity cost in his Theory of Social Economy (1914), as opposed to the English classics, they felt that the cost was the explicit spending produce or receive a good or service. Returning to the example of the taxi, the explicit cost of travel by taxi is the monetary outlay, ignores the health benefits of walking. Maluz M.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Opportunity cost is the difference between the value we give to something (product or service) and the real cost of that thing, when we decide to do or not that thing instead of another (which has its own value and cost). Juan Isidro GarcÃ­a</p></li>
<li><p>To me, as i understand opportunity cost (OC)= worth of the next best alternative-cost of thst next best alternative. Also, i'm not really sure as to how do i choose the next best alternative especially in socio-economic cases. -Abhishek Singh</p></li>
<li><p>So if I value the $40 concert at only $30 (maybe I don't like either musician all that much) is the OC -$10? Rick Sell</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity Cost is just a virtual cost, not a physical spending. In other words, 'it might have been earned'. - JongEok Yang</p></li>
<li><p>We know that the opportunity cost of not attending the Dylan concert is $10.  But if I value the Clapton concert also at $50, then the opportunity cost of attending Dylan concert instead of Clapton is $50.  - Simon Garrett</p></li>
<li><p>To me, the opportunity cost is choice the alternative that WE THINK is the best. For example, I prefer given up 100â‚¬ for a economics lesson than 50â‚¬ for a concert, because I think I will learn much more in a economics lesson than a concert and I think too that knowledge have no price. So, the opportunity cost is subjective. Depends of our interests. -  LuÃ­s Amaro Cerqueira</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opportunity cost</strong> is not the value of the next best alternative that expected by your own or in the present market, but what you <strong>really lose</strong> since you are giving up. - Dawn Tung, China</p></li>
