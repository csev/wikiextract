<p><strong>Competitive market</strong> is a market that has an structure with many buyers and many sellers where goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same, so that each buyer and seller is a price taker.</p>
<p>This means that no single consumer or seller can affect the price because they are small relatively with size of the market and with fierce competition, then they have very little control over the price, and should accept the price that the market determines.</p>
<p>That means is that they have no control over the price. They have to take the price from the market and do the best they can with that price, particularly by perhaps changing costs or changing the output.</p>
<p>Sometimes and additional criterion is use: Seller can freely enter or exit the market.</p>
