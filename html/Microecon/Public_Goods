<p>Takeaways from the public goods game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each individual is better off contributing to the public account rather than holding onto the money (red card). 
($12 when all contribute, $8 when none contribute). </li>
<li><p>When all individuals contribute, except for one, they are all still better off ($10 vs $8) but that one person gets the $8 from not contributing PLUS the $10 from the public account. So, this person gets to "Free-Ride" from the other individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Free-Rider problem arises when there is no incentive to contribute for public goods, like national defence. It is hard to compel people to pay for public goods, and makes it difficult for private institutions to provide that good as they can't charge people for it. Despite the fact all need and benefit from the public good. How do we make sure a needed public good can be provided in an efficient way, when the market cannot do it.</p></li>
</ul>
