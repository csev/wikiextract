<p>In regards to consumer surplus, you don't make any money but you have a feeling of savings.
Example:  You are willing to pay $10.  It costs you $4.  You have a consumer surplus of $6.  You didn't make any money from the transaction.  In fact you paid $4.  However, you have the feeling of saving $6 because of the willingness to pay $10.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="With_Producer_surplus.2C_there_is_an_actual_profit_or_at_minimum_a_balance_of_cost_in_regards_to_some_factors_.28below.29."><b>With Producer surplus, there is an actual profit or at minimum a balance of cost in regards to some factors (below).</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>How much am I willing to sell?
Willingness to sell (WTS)is the same as Cost.  What did the item cost when you first bought it?
One does not want to sell an item for less than they paid for the item in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Money you can actually measure--tangible</p></li>
<li><p>Depends on how much you spent initially (buying it before or producing it)</p>
<p>*Example:  You buy a "Barry White" CD for $10.  You then meet a friend who is a huge fan of Barry White's deep passionate voice.  She offers you $20.  You then have made a net gain of $10.
