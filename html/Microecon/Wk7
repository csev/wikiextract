Monopoly: 1 seller, unique product, examples: utility provider
Oligopoly: Few sellers, somewhat unique products, examples: airlines, oil producers
Monopolistic Competition: Many sellers, somewhat unique products, examples: retail items, foods</p>
<p>In order to have some qualitites of monopolies, such as price control, one must have Market Power:</p>
<p>Market Power sources:
<ul><li> Ownership of Resource (land)
</li><li> Technological Advantage (unique software)
</li><li> Patents or Government protection
</li><li> Product Differentiation (style, location, quality, advertising)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>When a firm has differentiation, they will produce less output.</p>
<p>Price Discrimination: Charging different prices for the same good to different customers.  This requires two things: 1) market power 2) must prevent resale of item to other buyers</p>
<p>Perfect price discrimination examples: car dealership sales, financial aid packages</p>
<p>Imperfect Price Discrimination examples: happy hour, movie theater ticket sales, coupons in newspaper, airline tickets (business vs personal/leisure, these two divided by amount of time between flight and purchase, and the day of the week traveled)</p>
<p>Examples of pricing strategies:</p>
<p>Bundling (software, cable tv channels), find lowest price for each category, bundle them together.  Not always, but possible to make more Total Revenue</p>
<p>Two-Part Tariff (health club, cell phone), entry fee and recurring fee</p>
<p>Three market failures this course will cover: 1 Monopolies 2 Public goods 3 Externalities</p>
<p>Quantity Effect: the increase in Total Revenue associated with increase in quantity sold.</p>
<p>Pricing Effect: the decrease in Total Revenue associated with decrease in price.</p>
<p>For Monopolies, the Marginal Revenue and the Price are not the same, also, the Marginal Revenue Curve is always below the demand curve (hence the extra markup they can charge).</p>
<p>Monopoly does three things:
1. Charges more
2. Earns a positive economic profit (which a firm would not in a perfect market)
3. Produces lower quantity</p>
<p>A monopoly creates a deadweight loss due to the lower quantity being produced.</p>
