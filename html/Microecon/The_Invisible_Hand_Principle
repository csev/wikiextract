<p>The Invisible Hand Principle is the incentive towards personal benefit, monetary or otherwise, that guides the behaviour of individuals, and therefore, society. </p>
<p>The Invisible Hand Principle suggests that <em>in free markets</em>, individuals, by pursuing <em>their own</em> best interest, end up serving the greater good at the same time.
Clearly hasn't this principle failed because of the 2008 global crisis where individuals pursuing their own best interests led the world to global financial meltdown&#160;? Himanshu Pant</p>
<p>reply to Himanshu Pant;  we should not forget that the markets " Global financial" where not and are not free in any true regard. Philip partridge.</p>
<p>The failure of Adam Smith's invisible hand is better illustrated in the Tragedy of the Commons, when the action of self-interest adversely affects common property. Penalties are needed to induce self-interested behaviour that still leads to the best outcome for society.</p>
<p>The example of this principle, the cost-benefit analysis of renting an old car v.s. a newer car, did not take into account the cost of driving a 40 year old car.  This car may need more repairs, may be difficult to find a mechanic, and parts may be hard and expensive to come by.  So, looking at rental and gas price alone is not realistic.</p>
<p>I think that in a realistic scenario we should also consider where we intend to drive the car to make a more complete cost-benefit analysis. Miles per Gallon may vary according to where we drive, if it's in an urban or extra urban environment. Marco Scacchi</p>
<p>One issue that the C02-reducing person also might consider, apart from the fuel used every year, is the amount of energy (and fossil resources) it cost to produce the car in the first place. Because he wishes not to waste any of that energy he might still consider the Buick as his best option, even if the price per gallon is higher than 1 USD. This way he will be one using the old car until it cannot drive any more (and thus maximizing the use of production-energy) and let some one who cares less about CO2-reduction drive the new car. Annika Brandenburg</p>
<p>One perspective I can think of is that if we see a probabilistic view of the old car being rented , will it get rented really that easily&#160;?  There is also a probability of some one with lesser income and thus driving mileage might hire that car.</p>
<p>The invisible hand principle is the result of the first two principles, which lead to making individual decisions. Those individual decisions create society´s pattern behaviour and they create an environment of self regulation of the market. I´m not sure that "the invisible hand" prioritizes the greater good though. -Salvador Gallegos Almaguer.</p>
<p>Having access to enough information is important to individuals to make good decisions and therefore for the markets to operate efficiently. When markets operate efficiently benefits everyone - Gorka Pagazaurtundua</p>
<p>In summary, the invisible hand is the decision made by a citizen which is based on the person's incentive to do good for himself/herself. In a more cosmopolitan view, this may do the greater good or the adverse. If one understands the invisible hand, they perspicacious view at Economics. Arka</p>
<p>The invisible hand principle: In the process where individuals try to maximise their own good, society is better off as a whole.</p>
<p>Some of the best examples of The Invisible Hand Principle are&#160;: You are standing in a line to fetch some medicines in-front of a counter and suddenly, 3 more counters reopen, then, automatically, you are triggered into rushing to the new counters so as to benefit yourself by saving time and getting onto the medicines quickly and save your kin from getting further ill. This, in turn, will improve your's kin's health at a quicker pace, and hence, he or she can get back to the pursued work, thus saving a lot of time and energy dispensed by the peers due to his or her absence thus generating enough time for everybody to spend more time with their families after work which in turn helps to rejuvenate the much emaciated mind and body and this helps in creating a better future for everyone. One, small change had been introduced, and the whole society got benefitted unknowingly to anyone-Deep Maity.</p>
<p>The possibility of cooperation without coercion. Milton Friedman.</p>

<p>The invisible hand principle are the driving forces or factors that cause rational/irrational people to make their decisions based on what the need/want.  An example here could be that a government releases a policy that makes people act or behave in a certain way. - Dennis H.</p>
<p>The invisible hand principle is a reminder that our actions influence other people to react in a certain way with the ultimate purpose of shaping our world. The first to principles in this module had a more individual outlook but like the example of the old and new car, someone may rent to old car for the sole purpose of getting it off the road and not driving it at all thus saving the environment from the pollution that car would have emitted.</p>
<p>The term "Invisible Hand" was coined by the father of economics, Adam Smith in the 1700s. If society tries to maximize its marginal benefits, it will succeed. -Leah, Minnesota</p>
<p>Of the many schools of economic thought, Adam Smith, considered the father of economics, was the leader of the "classical economics" school of thought. Classical economics believes that there is no fiscal nor monetary policy necessary in order to help stimulate and regulate the market. Rather, the "invisible hand" - or the self-regulating behavior of the marketplace, is more than enough. Essentially, the "invisible hand" is how individuals can make profit and maximize it without any sort of government intervention.</p>
<p>By pursuing his own self interest, the individual economic actors frequently promotes the development of society more effectively than when he really intends to develop the society. Individual economic actor each pursuing his own self interest are led by an invisible hand to promote an end that was not really a part of his intention(ie. although his intention was only his personal well-being, it results in the greater good for the society which was not part of his plan). Here individual economic actors refer to firms,households etc. It is interesting to note that these ideas are at the core of capitalism. - SNK, India.</p>
<p>The term "Invisible Hand" introduced by Adam Smith to connect economics with God, maybe just to stop people questioning the free market at the last point. Just think about a factory owner who destroys the environment to get maximize his own benefit. How could anyone claim that the society can get maximum benefit through factory owners behaving such selfishly? How could an invisible hand regulates this immoral situation without government intervention?</p>
<p>The Invisible Hand is just a convenient way of describing how people's self-centred decisions generally affect society as a whole. I don't believe that God directly acts in the free market. However, there are general principles at work which we can learn and use to our benefit. For example, Proverbs 22:7 tells us, "The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender." Isn't this a principle with broad applications around the world?</p>
