<ul>
<li><p>We were brought back into the model of the BBQ shop and comparing the firm and market using the long-run equilibrium model and what happens when the demand increases.</p></li>
<li><p>From a company setup for long-term equilibrium where MC=ATC=P, with an increase in demand, in the short-term profits increase.</p></li>
<li><p>When demand goes up, supply goes up to meet, which drives up prices and profits for the firms in business at the time increase.  </p></li>
<li><p>But over time, Long-run equilibrium being steadfast, creeps back into play as more and more firms jump into the profitable market.  With an increase in firms, there is a shift in the supply, which leads to a decrease in price, but with the previous demand increase holding steady what we come out with is the same price with more firms producing an even greater quantity.  </p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>In the long-term, more firms generate lower prices and increased quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>It would also seem that competitors mooch profits.</p></li>

The example question in the video has a flaw and needs corrected!</strong></p>
