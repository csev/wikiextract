<p>Tax imposed on Buyers (i.e. - Consumers pay at the pump)</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/images/2/23/5.2_Distributional_Effects_of_Tax.png" class="image"><img alt="5.2 Distributional Effects of Tax.png" src="/wiki/images/2/23/5.2_Distributional_Effects_of_Tax.png" width="441" height="560" /></a>
<ul><li> Let take gasoline as an example. Lets assume the market price of gasoline is 3$ before tax. 
</li><li> IF tax introduced of 50 cents on buyers, demand curve shifts to the left for 50 cents (i.e. the price at every quantity shifts "down" 50 cents). New equilibrium price is 2.75.
</li><li> Buyers end up paying 3.25 (2.75 + 0.50 for tax).  Sellers only receive 2.75 (since the .50 goes to the government).  Everybody is worse off
</li><li> In this case the burden of the tax is shared equally by buyers and sellers. The buyers need to pay 25 cents more, sellers receive 25 cents less for a unit of their product. </p>
</li></ul>

<p><br />
Taxes imposed on Sellers (seller must pay for each unit sold)</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/images/8/82/5.2_Distributional_Effects_of_Tax_2.png" class="image"><img alt="5.2 Distributional Effects of Tax 2.png" src="/wiki/images/8/82/5.2_Distributional_Effects_of_Tax_2.png" width="492" height="548" /></a>
<ul><li> If tax introduced of 50 cents on sellers, supply curve shifts to the left for 50 cents as it becomes more expensive to produce. 
</li><li> New equilibrium price is 3,25.<br />
</li><li> The burden of the tax is shared equally by buyers and sellers. The buyers need to pay 25 cents more, sellers receive 25 cents less for a unit of their product, as 5o cents of price received goes to government. </p>
</li></ul>

<p>So it does not matter which side of the market is taxed, buyers or sellers, the burden is shared between them.</p>
<p>The distribution of the tax burden depends on who has more difficulties to adapt to the tax and price changes, which depends on elasticity.</p>
<p>For gasoline, the demand is more inelastic than supply, so buyers suffer more from tax burden.
So a more realistic supply vs demand curve for gasoline...(note that the demand curve is steeper, i.e. - it is more inelastic) <br />

Now this time, when a 50 cent tax is imposed: <br />
<a href="/wiki/images/1/1d/5.2_Distributional_Effects_of_Tax_4.png" class="image"><img alt="5.2 Distributional Effects of Tax 4.png" src="/wiki/images/1/1d/5.2_Distributional_Effects_of_Tax_4.png" width="612" height="398" /></a>
<ul><li> The equilibrium price doesn't shift as much (2.80)
</li><li> Sellers will cover 20 cents (40 percent of the 50 cents charged)
</li><li> Buyers will have to cover the other 30 cents (60 percent), and therefore pay 3.30</p>
</li></ul>

<p><br /><br />
<b>Conclusion: When the demand side is more inelastic, the buyer has to cover most of the burden of the tax</b></p>
