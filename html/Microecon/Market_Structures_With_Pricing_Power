<ul>
<li><p><strong>Monopoly</strong>. A market structure in which <em>one company</em> is the only seller of a product and if the product does not have close substitutes, it is unique.

How many sellers are there in the, in the industry? <em>0ne</em>. Is the product they sell differentiated? <em>Yes, it is unique</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oligopoly</strong>. A market structure in which only a <em>few sellers</em> offer similar or identical products. As a result, the actions of any seller in the market can have a huge impact on the profits of all the others. Oligopolistic firms are <em>interdependent</em>. How many sellers are there in the, in the industry? <em>Few</em>. Is the product they sell differentiated? <em>Somewhat differentiated</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monopolistic Competition</strong>. a market structure in which <em>many firms</em> sell products that are alike but not identical. In a monopolistically competitive market, each firm has a monopoly over its product, but many other companies produce similar products that compete for the same clients. How many sellers are there in the, in the industry? <em>Many</em>. Is the product they sell differentiated? <em>Somewhat differentiated</em></p></li>
</ul>
