<p>The owner of the establishment said why he would not increase the price of his sandwiches.  It has two effects when you increase the price of the sandwiches:</p>
<ol>
<li>You make more money on every sandwich by increasing the price of the sandwiches.</li>
<li>You also have less people coming through the door due to raising prices.</li>
</ol>
<p>The price of elasticity of demand is that measure that is going to tell you what is the rate of the two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Rate, in terms,of the money you will make; and</li>
<li>The people you will lose coming through the door.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you own a business, that is a very important rate, because it will tell you if you have wiggle room.  If you can increase the price of your sandwiches without really losing the number of people coming through the door, then increasing the price of the Bar-B-Que sandwiches, is a good idea.</p>
<p>Knowing information about the price of sandwiches or about the elasticity of the price of sandwiches is going to be really important to your business.</p>
