<p>If there somebody on the market who wants the product (e.g. a ticket to popular soccer game)and who is willing to pay for this, but cannot get itâ€“ this market is not efficient. It means that it is far from the equilibrium and there is lost surplus.</p>
<p>Example: 2004 Chicago Cubs made the playoffs, so the price that people were willing to pay for the tickets went up.  BUT the law has scalping laws (setting a maximum resell value of the tickets to ~$100).  How do people get around this?
<ul><li> People sold the tickets for $120, but you can only buy the ticket IF you buy a T-shirt for $1000 dollars
</li><li> Equivalently, eBay off some item but stick the tickets on for "free."</p>
</li></ul>
