<p>When the number of competitors is fewer than the usual the company has the opportunity to markup its price. <strong>Markup</strong> means when a company is charging to the consumers a price that is a lot larger than what it cost them to provide their good.</p>
<p>The answer to this is because the price elasticity of demand and the fact that the companies have to pay attention to that when they have price power. When the prices is very elastic because the consumer has a lot of choices then the company cannot markup the price.</p>
<p>Then when the <em>more elastic</em> a good is, the <strong>less markup</strong> could be apply to the price, and the <em>more inelastic</em> is the good, the the company can charge to the customers a price that is a lot larger than the total cost of production then the price will have <strong>more markup</strong>.</p>
