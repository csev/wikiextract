<p>Title: Embedding Digital Literacy in the Curriculum              </p>
<p>Source or Location: Nottingham Trent University (UK)</p>
<p>Short Description: "Study Skills" has been a traditional module taught to first year Health and Social Care undergraduates to help them make the transition from secondary to higher education. It has normally been delivered through seminars which incorporate written exercises on Harvard referencing, plagiarism and academic writing skills. The module has recently been overhauled to focus more on digital literacies. The class takes place in a specially designed classroom with laptops, wifi and round tables to enable group collaboration. "Teaching" is minimal as a more inquiry based approach is used. The content is also different as classes focus on digital citizenship, using social media for research, effective search strategies, developing research questionnaires and a curation project using platforms such as Storify and Pinterest. The url below is for a team blog that charts our successes and failures through the first months of this project.</p>

<p>Title: Scaling Small to Big Participation: The Educational Assessment BOOC</p>
<p>Location: Indiana University</p>
<p>Brief Description:  A small online course had previously been refined using situative theories of cognition and participatory approaches to learning working with dozens of students.  This course and its interactive features were scaled up using Google Course Builder and offered to hundreds of students a Big Open Online Course (BOOC) in Fall 2013.  The course was a success in that persistence rates were much higher most MOOCs and individual and social engagement was high overall and actually increased across the 11 weekly “wikifolio” assignments. This suggests we should scale up open learning gradually and use design-based research methods and situative approaches to assessment and learning.</p>
<p>This research is the latest cycle in program of design-based research that explores the implications of situated approaches to learning and assessment.  By aligning informal, semi-formal, and formal assessment, these efforts have delivered very high levels of socio-technological engagement with disciplinary knowledge while leaving behind dramatically enhanced individual understanding and significantly enhanced aggregated achievement.  Previous cycles of refinement of a small online course on educational assessment had resulted in a number of innovative features and informal learning analytics.  This course was scaled up as “Big Open Online Course” (“BOOC”) that was taught in Fall 2013 using Google’s Course Builder open learning platform.  Most of the features refined and streamlined and/or automated in this effort.  These included personally contextualized registration &amp; participation, assignment to networking groups, personalized “wikifolio” open assignments, anchored peer commenting, contextualized analytics &amp; feedback, peer endorsement &amp; promotion, and open digital badges for completion, leadership, &amp; advanced work.  Analyses revealed impressive levels of persistence (60 of the 160 who completed the first assignment completed the course), engagement (over 80% of persisters engaged in peer promotions and levels of peer commenting, endorsement &amp; promotion increased across the course) and learning (scores on random sample items from the textbook item pool of .84, .76, and .75 on exams and .75 on the final). The local theories were advanced by further elaborating the principles and practices with the notions of consequential knowledge and contextual knowledge. </p>
<p>The course is now closed and the presence of eight for-credit students prevents us from opening it.  But a sandbox version is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://booc-stage.appspot.com/course">here</a>:  and numerous blogposts are available <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://booc-stage.appspot.com/course">RemediatingAssessment.blogspot.com</a>.</p>

<p>Title: MOOCing?</p>
<p>Source or Location: University of California, Berkeley</p>
<p>Short Description:</p>
<p>MOOCing? is a choreographic meta-investigation of online instruction. This artistic project places dance, an art form predicated on liveness, physicality, and corporeality, at the center of conversations about the increasingly mediated future of education in the twenty-first century. The twenty-minute dance is the product of Internet-based collaborations and online instruction between a choreographer working in New York, New York and nine students dancing in Berkeley, California. An accompanying blog and interactions through Google+ and hangouts opens the choreographic process to others who want to collaborate. As an endsemble cast, MOOCing? performers consider what it means to learn movement from someone who is not physically present. They ask, is it possible to bring the specificity of our physical place to each other through the means of the Internet? What does it mean to make traditionally physical dance from afar and online? How does this process add to embodied knowledge? From these questions come a dance about distance, place, and access. </p>

<p>Source or Location:&#160;: University of California, Riverside</p>
<p>Short Description: Freshman class on "Violence and Latin American History"  This class is part of the First-Year cluster courses taught at UC Riverside. The classes rarely have less than 60 students, so the challenge has always been how to take 60+ 18 years olds who just got out of high-school and immerse them productively and effectively into the college experience. This year, I am teaching the class with a significant amount of social media as a bridge between the in-class lecture and discussion and each student's individual expererience with the craft of history. We are playing jeopardy via twitter to reinforce reading comprehension and we are live-tweeting the lectures (instead of posting class powerpoints). All exams and quizzes are online, and meetings with students happen in class, in office hours, on google hangout or facebook - the goal is to create engagement and curiosity to mazimize learning. Final projects include wikipedia articles, video projects, digital presentations.  The course is behind a UCR firewall, but the syllabus link is below.</p>

<p>Short Description: "In 2013, FemTechNet initiated a networked learning experiment involving instructors and students from several institutions in the creation of a collaborative open course structure called a <strong>DOCC:  Distributed Open Collaborative Course</strong> on the topic of “Dialogues on Feminism and Technology The first iteration of the DOCC 2013 will take place from <strong>September-December, 2013</strong>. Ideas for DOCC courses to <strong>interact</strong> are listed <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HandoutInteractions_withInstructions.pdf">here</a>, with instructions. Feminism and feminists have been integral to technology innovation, yet as recently as June 2012, the New York Times carried an article about Silicon Valley that opened with the line:  “Men invented the Internet.”  As technology remakes academia and the arts, critical analysis of gender, sexualities, and race have been absent in much of this re-thinking of disciplines and practices..." [The DOCC is a feminist alternative to the MOOC.]  "  A MOOC (massive open online course) is typically organized and branded by a single (elite) institution. A DOCC recognizes and is built on the understanding that expertise is distributed throughout a network, among participants situated in diverse institutional contexts, within diverse material, geographic, and national settings, and who embody and perform diverse identities (as teachers, as students, as media-makers, as activists, as trainers, as members of various publics, for example)."</p>

<p>Title: Explore: Faculty-Student Partnership Projects</p>
<p>Source or Location: National University of Ireland, Galway</p>
<p>Short Description: Building on earlier good practice at the University of Exeter and Birmingham City University (both, England), NUI Galway launched its 'Explore' scheme which, every year, provides funding for small scale projects that involve collaboration between students and staff (faculty, as you call them in the US!). Only, jointly submitted proposals will be considered. The scheme (which itself is a joint venture between the Office of the Vice President for Innovation &amp; Performance and the Students' Union) covers any form of activity and has, for example included:</p>
<p>the development of new teaching &amp; learning resources (eg in Academic Writing, Maths skils, Self-guided field trips, etc)
exploration of issues of relevance to student life and experience (mental and physical health and well-being)
Civic and community engagement (eg Local transport surveys and planning for the City, arts-related activities)
technology innovation (development of range of apps, simulations, videocasting and a QR tagging of trees on campus for further info on species, history of campus, etc)
training and skills (coding, video production)

<p>Short Description:   The Community Knowledge initiative (CKI) was initially funded by a donation from the Atlantic Philanthropies and set out to examine the possibilities for translating the ideas of service-learning/community-based learning into the Irish context as well as promoting volunteering and greater communication between the University and wider society. CKI developed three main strands: (1) Student Volunteering, which has been extremely successful with around 2000 students registering for volunteering opportunities every year and over 1000 of them completing the requirements for the award of a certificate (includes self reflection, compilation of a portfolio, training,  etc); (2) Service Learning, which has now become embedded within 30 degree programmes in the institution, with students undertaking a range of learning experiences that are connected with community organisations and NGOs; (3) community based research partnerships and outreach, which helps match community organisations' research needs with student projects, research groups and similar.</p>

<p>Title:  Multiple Choice/Standardized Testing: How to Make It a (Better) Learning  Experience          </p>
<p>Source or Location:  HASTAC: Changing the Way We Teach and Learn</p>
<p>Short Description:   In this blog, HASTAC cofounder Cathy Davidson describes how she takes the static form of the standardized test and, by only offering item-choices that are correct, makes the best of the form by turning it into a learning review.  Research shows that people tend to remember the wrong content offered on multiple choice testing, so, with a little effort, one can ensure that the form of the question and the possible answers only offer accurate, true information from which one makes selections based on relevance to the question, the best choice, and so forth.  Davidson critiques high-stakes summative testing in the "How We Measure" chapter of her book Now You See It and in her Coursera MOOC.</p>

<p>Source or Location: Wired Magazine; Duke University</p>
<p>Short Description:  Reversing a trend to simply assume technology was the same as learning, Duke University gave each of its 1,650 incoming freshmen a free iPod as part of an initiative to foster innovative uses of technology in the classroom.  Duke's goal was to have students take the lead in experimenting with creative academic uses for the devices.  Second, third, and fourth year students were also offered free iPods if they came up with learning uses for what, then, was a "music listening device" and could convince a professor to include this use on a syllabus.  Within one semester, more iPods were given away because of student-created learning uses than were given free to freshmen.   The world's first academic "podcasting" conference (in quotes on the poster) occured at Duke because of this experiment which also helped to launch iTunes U.  It was an educational experiment in every way, designed to reverse the trend of simply</p>

<p>Title: DukeImmerse             </p>
<p>Source or Location: Duke University</p>
<p>Short Description: "In 2009, a group of Duke faculty developed the idea of a multidisciplinary, integrated curricular program that would allow students to explore a single issue or problem through the combined lens of four completely integrated courses during a semester. They called this idea “DukeImmerse.” In this model, students enroll in four courses as in a typical semester, but these courses are delivered in a completely integrated fashion, without the constraints imposed by separate meeting times and places. Because students all enroll in the same four courses, they use all their academic time to immerse themselves in one multidisciplinary program for an entire semester. DukeImmerse programs are intended to more closely connect student learning with faculty academic interests, and so are expected to focus on issues that faculty are actively engaging in their own research. Faculty-student interaction is expected to be frequent, informal and collaborative, as one might see in a progressive laboratory or a start-up company. Professors and students have the freedom to dynamically schedule teaching and learning activities, taking advantage of more opportunities to connect classroom learning with the real world, and, if necessary, to leave campus for extended periods to enhance the curriculum."</p>
