<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Medici_University">Medici University</span></h1>
<p>We live in the 21st century. Yet most universities today live in the 19th century. Education as typically experienced by the future <em>labor force</em> was designed to meet the needs of the Industrial Revolution. Universities today may <em>use</em> Information Revolution tools, but the vast majority are not offering an Information Age educational experience.</p>
<p><strong><em>Medici University is different.</em></strong></p>
<p>At Medici University we don't believe in <em>requirements.</em> We also don't believe in fees. At Medici University real education begins where arbitrary requirements end.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/images/1/11/MU-FutureED-Fire450.jpg" class="image"><img alt="MU-FutureED-Fire450.jpg" src="/wiki/images/1/11/MU-FutureED-Fire450.jpg" width="450" height="301" /></a></p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="A_True_21st_Century_University.">A True 21st Century University.</span></h2>
<p>Medici University is a <strong><em>non-accredited</em></strong> Graduate University. If you are a soulless sleep-walker devoid of dreams, passion, or vision, who believes that USD 60,000 of debt and a piece of paper will bring you a better life at some future time, then Medici University is not for you.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for real learning and experience that's applicable to your life, and if you believe that the absence of debt represents the presence of freedom and possibilities, then Medici University may be exactly the right school for you.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_Alternative_MFA">Your Alternative MFA</span></h3>
<p>Medici University offers <em>Alternative MFA</em> programs in all arts disciplines. By alternative, we mean requirement free. We don't have a <em>catalog</em> or <em>requirements</em> telling you what to study, instead we empower you to explore your passion, and from that create your own curriculum. You can take courses if you need to learn specific skills or techniques, but as much as possible, Medici University encourages students to actively practice their art.</p>
<p>Writers should write every day. And read everything. You don't really need an advisor and USD 30,000 in tuition to be told that, do you?</p>
<p>Choreographers should dance and create every day. And see, F2F and on video, every choreographer and company they possibly can. Internet Hacktivists should be world travelers of cyberspace, taking everything apart and building something new every day.</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_Goals">Your Goals</span></h3>
<p>Although you may get a <em>job</em> and work for a <em>company</em> after completing your MU degree, this is not our goal. We do not believe that our graduates, nor most human beings, are best suited to work that is measured in hours. MU students work hard, but their work is not measured in hours, it is measured in results. MU encourages its graduates to leverage their laptop and The Internet to create a time-clock and cubicle free career.</p>
<p>So long as you are clear on what Medici University is, and is not, we actually will give you a piece of paper when you complete your degree objectives. Well, not <em>actual</em> paper, of course, nothing at Medici University is on actual paper. But we'll give you a lovely virtual diploma, suitable for posting on your website or LinkedIn page.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_Application">Your Application</span></h3>
<p>Our inaugural year begins 1 August 2014. Exceptional students may begin work earlier. If you have the courage to spend your education, career, and life truly immersed in the 21st century and not the 19th, MU would love to read your application. Begin the process on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://mediciuniversity.co.uk/contact/">Medici University Contact Page</a> indicating your proposed area of study and a brief explanation about your passion for this work.</p>
<p><em>Success to all seekers!</em></p>
