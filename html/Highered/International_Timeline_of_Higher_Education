<p>Earliest known use of writing (other than for counting), Mesopotamia (Sumer)</p>
<p>Notes regarding writing:</p>
<p>For thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution human social networks remained relatively small and simple. The first that managed to overcome this problem, were the ancient Sumerians, who lived in Southern Mesopotamia, what is today Southern Iraq. Large towns and even kingdoms began to grow around the year 4000 BC there. </p>
<p>Sometime between 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some unknown Sumerian geniuses invented a new system for storing and processing information outside the brain. This new system was custom-built to handle large amounts of numbers of mathematical data. In this way the Sumerian’s released their social order from the limitations of the human brain 
and opened the way for the appearance of larger societies. </p>
<p>This data processing system that the Sumerian’s invented is of course writing. Writing is a method for storing and processing information by using material signs rather than neurons. Writing wasn’t invented to write poetry or philosophy, or history, this could and was done without writing. (If we look for the first words of wisdom reaching us from our ancestors 5,000 years ago we are in for a disappointment. If you’re thinking that the first words of wisdom written by human kind is some kind of big philosophical idea or some kind of wonderful poem or story then think again).</p>

<p>1769, Dartmouth College in New Hampshire was founded under British bylaws as a private institution.  By the early 1800’s the College’s board of trustees agreed with the State of New Hampshire that Dartmouth would make a fine “State” college – a public institution.  The college's president disagreed and the riff between Dartmouth’s president and the Board of Trustees evolved into the landmark supreme course case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1811.  The famed Daniel Webster argued the case on behalf of Woodward purporting that it was unconstitutional to usurp the rights of a private institution and turn it into a public institution.  Daniel Webster won the case, resulting in laws that have protected the rights of private institutions of higher education for over 200 years.  Dartmouth College continues to operate today as a private college in New Hampshire. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17/518">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17/518</a>

<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.auth.gr/en/uni">Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</a> was founded in 1925 by Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastassiou (Law 3341/14-6-25). It was the second Greek university to be founded after the University of Athens, which was established in 1837. It comprised the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Law and Economics, the School of Theology and the Medical School. During 3 successive stages it came to include the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (1950); the Departments of Pharmacy and Dentistry (founded in 1955 and 1959 respectively) added to the Medical School; the Institutes of Foreign Languages (English, French, German and Italian) were added to the Faculty of Philosophy; from 1951 to 1975 new departments and Schools were founded as part of the Polytechnic Faculty, which developed to an independent Polytechnical University: School of Civil Engineering (1955–56), School of Architecture (1956–1957), School of Rural and Surveying Engineering (1962–1963), School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (1972–1973), School of Chemical Engineering (1972–1973), School of Mathematics, Physics and Computational Sciences (1982–1983) and School of Urban-Regional Planning and Development Engineering (2004). The School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was split in two independent schools (School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering) in 1976. From 1976 till 2010, mane changes were introduced in the structural organization of the Aristotle University and the Polytechnical University of Thessaloniki: some Faculties downgraded to Schools, Schools to Departments and vice-versa; also a number of Institutes and labs have been attached to the University, some of them having an inter-departmental status. In 2013, the Aristotle University comprised 12 Faculties, 36 schools, and numerous units (labs, libraries, clinics, research centers, institutes, etc.). It came to be the largest university in Greece and in southeastern Europe as well, in terms of faculty members number, under- and post-graduate students number, variety and extend of facilities. Aristotle University disposes of a large number of endowments, runs a profitable publishing house, and receives financial support from the Greek government (dramatically diminishing after the economic crisis of 2010). </p>
