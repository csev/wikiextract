<p>The students in Professor Davidson's face-to-face course (aka your community TAs) have created a first draft of some basic, preliminary ideas for their collaborative project on designing higher education from scratch. Please find below a "napkin sketch" for your comments and feedback from our "Designing Higher Education from Scratch" project, created by a project team in the Duke "History and Future of Higher Education" course.

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Our_College">Our College</span></h1>
<p><em>Motto: “Helping students engineer bridges toward our future…”</em></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>:  In today’s world, landing a good job and a secure income often depends on graduating from a four year college. Unfortunately college completion rates for students from low-income families are significantly lower than their higher-income counterparts. While the reasons for this are complex, it is partially due to the fact that students from low-income families often do not have access to quality high school education and therefore are not equipped with the skills needed to thrive in college.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: Our College is a small low-cost junior/community college aimed at equipping promising students with the skills they need to succeed in a rigorous higher education environment.  Our College targets the underserved population of low-income students [in the city where we are located] who enter college without the skills and support they need to succeed. </p>
<p><strong>We value</strong>:
<ul><li>Developing student’s abilities for self-teaching and critical thinking
</li><li>Students engaging their teachers as well as their peers
</li><li>Innovative effective teaching
</li><li>Intellectual freedom for students and teachers</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>We intervene by</strong>:
<ul><li>Providing underprivileged, promising students of all ages from the community where we are located low-cost access to quality learning experiences 
</li><li>Emphasizing Service Learning
</li><li>Real-world capstone project
</li><li>Structured mentorship (peer/professor)
</li><li>Offering salaries and working conditions that inspire and support professors who excel at innovative and dynamic teaching</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Our students</strong>:
<ul><li>Come from low-income families based in the region where we are located
</li><li>Are intelligent and motivated to succeed through advancing into higher education.
</li><li>Come from educational backgrounds that did not fully prepare them for the challenges of college</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Structure</strong>:
<ul><li>In order to keep costs down, Our College does not have a university campus, but rather is located in a low-cost office building in an area convenient to our student body. 
</li><li>It is a commuter school; there are no on-campus housing options.
</li><li>With the exception of college counseling, our student resources are kept to a minimum in order to keep administration small and tuition at a very affordable level. 
</li><li>Part of our administration needs would be met through a work-study program for students who would serve the university while attending classes.
</li><li>Tenure is not a feature of Our College. In lieu of tenure, all professors are paid high salaries and good benefits. Teaching performance is evaluated every three years through a combination of peer-to-peer evaluations, teaching portfolios, student outcomes, self-evaluation, and other yet-to-be-determined forms of evaluation. If a teacher receives a negative teaching evaluation, they are given one year to improve their performance. 
</li><li>Our library  is all built from electronic materials. We do not have a big physical library, but we do have thousands of books, journals, magazines which students can access at any time with PCs, tablets, PDAs.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Pedagogy</strong>:
<ul><li>Our College focuses on the delivery of transferrable skills instead of the traditional silos or disciplines of higher education.
</li><li>Since the focus of Our College is learning how to learn, classes focus on critical thinking, rhetoric and communication, language and composition, mathematical reasoning, scientific exploration, and aesthetic interpretation.
</li><li>Our College intends to foster an environment dedicated to student learning.  Teachers at Our College recognize that students learn in a variety of ways, and they are dedicated to a constant review of teaching methods and practices.
</li><li>Our college has many linkages with industry for practical, hands-on experience of our students. Faculty are mostly industry experts, who teach on a part-time basis.</p>
</li></ul>
