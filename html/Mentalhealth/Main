<p>EDIT Feb 18th:<br />
  (Big thanks to whomever has been updating this page!! ~Christine Gordon)<br />
 -Added the prof's resources (only the ones w/ links!) from the course in an easy to read/access format (I don't really know how to edit this page so <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/124JZSRt03maAXCPJhQButxAamDk8ZosoUshlDQXfDhE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> it is as a google doc and maybe someone else can make it look good in here?).<br />
 Questions:<br />
  -Maybe these edits should be their own page? 
  -Can we get the table of contents to be the first thing on the page? and/or could it have a menu bar on the side or something?  </p>
<p>EDIT Feb 20th:</p>
<ul>
<li>added Q5c on how to participate in writing subtitles for the course</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT Feb 23rd:</p>
<ul>
<li>added Q1f on what browser versions are compatible with coursera</li>

<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Assignments">Assignments</span></h2>
<p><strong>2a Where can I find the assignments?</strong></p>
<p>The writing assignments can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/lecture/index">here</a> and the extra credit quiz can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/quiz/index">here</a></p>
<p><strong>2b How do I submit my assignment?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: You can submit your assignment by going to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/human_grading/index">Peer Assessment</a> and then 'go to assignment'. <em>Not possible? Get a blank page? Try a different browser. Mozilla, safari &amp; chrome are all easily downloaded and installed. Check if you are using a correct version. See question 1f</em></p></li>
<li><p>Step 2: Enter your commentary in the box specified. <em>(Note: for Assignment #2, the first box is where you list which assignment you are answering - A or B - and the second box is for your assignment.) Make sure you are within the word limit (it won't allow essays that are above). Can't copy-paste from MS word? Try using the keyboard shortcuts ('ctrl c' for copying; 'ctrl v' for pasting.)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Step 3: Scroll down until you see the 'work cited' box and list your sources. <em>(Note: Assignment #2 has just had a 'work cited box' added. It is optional. No points are granded or deducted if you use references.) Didn't use any sources? Just write n/a in the box. Didn't literally quote them, but still used them? Make sure you list your sources then! Just write down a number in your essay where you used a source or took an idea from a source - even if it is just the lectures - and then in your work cited box list the numbers with the source information attached.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Step 4: Check the 'honor' code box. <em>You can find this both at the top and the bottom of the page. You need to click this and clicking it means you are entering YOUR OWN work - and not someone else's. (Therefore: make sure you use that work cited box to specify which sources you used to create your work....)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Step 5: Press SUBMIT. <em>Pressing 'save' doesn't submit and doesn't count as a submission. Don't worry if you spot an error immediately after you submitted. You can re-submit as many times as you like until the deadline. Once you have pressed submit, you get a button asking you to review your work. Clicking that leads you to a screen where you can see how your essay will look to your peer reviewers. Anything odd or not the way you want it? Go back. Change it. Press 'submit' and review again until you are satisfied! (Reviewing your own submission is optional but still advisable.)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Note: Did you get the Warning: <em>You are attempting to submit a Partially completed assignment. Are you sure?</em> The Coursera website gives that message when you haven't filled in all the boxes. Try checking if you used the first box to indicate which question you used; the second box for the assignment and the newly added third box for possible references. The reference box has been added per popular request, but is optional. If you haven't used any references, just write n/a in the box. This should mark the assignment as 'complete' and allow you to submit without getting the warning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2c Will Charmaine assess my assignment?</strong></p>
<p>No. The course is peer-assessed, so your assignment will be graded by your fellow students. Similarly, you will be an assessor for at least five students.</p>
<p><strong>2d How is my grade calculated?</strong></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/971175-how-do-peer-assessments-work-">"The grade you receive is the median of all the peer grades. The reason for taking the median instead of the average of all peer grades is to reduce unreliable grades. Grades that are overly high or low will have a much smaller influence on the final median grade, as compared to the average of all grades."</a></p>
<p>I.e. So: if 4 (out of five) people graded you a 12 and only one gave you zero marks, that means that you still receive a 12. (Had it been the average grade, you would only have received a 9.6 (The median is the grade exactly in the middle: in 1 3 5 8 12; this would be 5. In 5 7 9 12 12; this would mean 9. In the example given above: 0 12 12 12 12; this would be 12. Etc.)</p>
<p>In other words, even if one (or two) people genuinely graded you unfairly this still does not impact your grade. Coursera does this in all her courses for precisely this reason: so that a grade that is overly high or low has a much smaller impact on the final grade. The idea is that this therefore produces more reliable grades than if they should take the average.</p>
<p><strong>2e What if I don't want a grade for the course?</strong></p>
<p>You are more than welcome to audit the course. (Auditing a course means you listen to the video lectures, and perhaps complete the reading or post in the fora, but that you do not partake in the assignments.)</p>
<p><strong>2f Wordcount. Why does the Coursera website tell me I am over the word limit, but my word processor (MS Word; Open Office, take your pick) tell me I'm under the word limit?</strong></p>
<p>MS Word, Open Office, etc. and the Coursera website merely use different ways of counting words.
MS Word counts hyphenated words (seventeenth-century England; the best-before-date) as one word, but Coursera counts them as two (or three depending on how many you hyphenated...). MS Word doesn't always count abbreviations such as ' I've' or 'She's' as two words, but the Coursera website does.
Just be aware of it (and also know that you can actually submit a text just over the word limit since there is a cushion included in the assignment box of approximately 10%.)</p>
<p><strong>2g What if I don't agree about my grade &amp; want it to be re-assessed?</strong></p>
<p>Sorry. That is not possible. Your only option here is to post your assignment on the forum so that you can invite more detailed feedback &amp; hopefully improve next time. If you were genuinely graded unfairly then I sympatize but there is still no way to have your grade re-assessed. Try posting on a thread such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/forum/thread?thread_id=3166">this</a> for some positive encouragement!</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Starting_Late">Starting Late</span></h2>
<p><strong>3a Can I still gain a certificate?</strong></p>
<p>BEFORE FEB 20th 8.59 am GMT+2 (so check your timezone): Yes. So long as you make sure you complete the last two assignments which are worth <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/wiki/view?page=syllabus">20% and 60% respectively</a>. You are also encouraged to take the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/quiz/index">extra credit quiz</a>. You need 70% to get a 'statement of completion'.</p>
<p>AFTER FEB 20th 8.59 am GMT+2 (again, check your timezone): No, as soon as the deadline for assignment #2 has expired, you can no longer gain the required score for a certificate.</p>
<p><strong>3b Why should I still do the course if I can no longer get a certificate?</strong></p>
<p>Because the value of the course is not determined by the certificate, but by what you can learn from it. We are all here to learn. Just by listening to the lectures, reading the material and attempting to put your own thoughts into words by writing an assignment or posting on the forum, you can benefit from taking this course - regardless of any certificates involved.</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Forum">Forum</span></h2>
<p><strong>4a How do I subscribe to a thread?</strong></p>
<p>You can either subscribe when you post on the thread (the 'subscribe' option is automatically on when you respond), or you can choose 'subscribe' at the top right hand of the page.</p>
<p><strong>4b Can I receive (or stop receiving) e-mails when someone replies to one of my posts?</strong></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/572223-how-do-i-stop-receiving-email-updates-from-discussion-threads-">From the Coursera help pages:</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you only want to stop receiving a single discussion thread, you can unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe button at the top of the thread. </p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to to be auto-subscribed to a thread after you reply to it, uncheck the “Subscribe to this thread at the same time.” box that’s at the bottom of each reply (you have to do this for each thread). </p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t want any forum e-mails at all, go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://class.coursera.org/mentalhealth-001/class/preferences">User Preferences</a>, and under Email Preferences, select “No, I would NOT like to receive forum notifications for subscriptions.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4c How do I upvote or downvote a post?</strong></p>
<p>You click on the arrows at the bottom of each post. Up- and downvoting are an indication of how useful a post is. Additionally, by upvoting a post it will rank higher on the 'featured' threads entitled 'top threads'. This will ensure students are more likely to spot it.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'm accessing Coursera on a tablet (ipad specifically) or mobile phone (iphone specifically) and the numbers don't change. Is that correct?</em> Yes. Unfortunately, if you are on an apple device, you cannot upvote or downvote a post. This is a technical issue at Coursera and likely won't be resolved anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>4d How do I tag a thread?</strong></p>
<p>At the top of a thread, you can click 'Add a Tag'. By tagging all threads which contain references with the word 'reference', for instance, you can then, weeks later, still find those posts again by searching for the tag 'references' which will show all the posts tagged as such. </p>
<p><strong>4e Am I being graded on my forum activity?</strong></p>
<p>No. The forums can be useful and engaging, but you don't get credit for it. The answer to Q3b applies here as well.</p>

<p><strong>5a Is Wikipedia generally considered a good source?</strong></p>
<p>Although wikipedia can be used as a starting point, wikipedia is generally NOT considered an academic source because anyone can edit its contents.</p>
<p>Wikipedia itself acknowledges this:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ACite&amp;page=coursera">'IMPORTANT NOTE: Most educators and professionals do not consider it appropriate to use tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as a sole source for any information—citing an encyclopedia as an important reference in footnotes or bibliographies may result in censure or a failing grade. Wikipedia articles should be used for background information, as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting point for further research.</a></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ACite&amp;page=coursera">As with any community-built reference, there is a possibility for error in Wikipedia's content—please check your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information.'</a></p>
<p><strong>5b Using subtitles</strong></p>
<p>It is easier to understand the content of the lectures, especially if you are struggling with English, if you activate the subtitles. You can turn on the subtitles by clicking on the "CC" button in the bottom-right of the video player.</p>
<p><strong>5c How to I participate in writing the subtitles?</strong></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/Video_Subtitles">The following webpage</a> explains in detail how to work on subtitles for Coursera courses. (It's part of the 'wiki' and requires you to log in with your coursera account again before you can view the page.) A reason for a lot of the errors is because the initial subtitles are done by a machine transcription program.</p>
<p>Once you've created an account, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.amara.org/en/teams/coursera/videos/?project=mentalhealth">here</a> are the videos for this course.</p>
