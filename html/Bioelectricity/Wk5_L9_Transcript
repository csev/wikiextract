<p>Hello, again. This is Roger Coke Barr for the Bioelectricity course. We’re in week number five where we’re laying track and we are at lecture segment number nine. Segment nine is about determining the trans-membrane current and you are thinking finally, finally this guy is going to work on the trans-membrane current. Because you remember,We started this week with the equation that said, IM = IC + I ion. And we said,to use this equation, we need to have IM. And I promised you back in the beginning that if you wanted to know IM, the way to find it was from the neighbor's. Well,after all, this multitude of preliminaries,we're finally going to talking about trans-membrane current. It's just wonderful. This is a simple argument, but let me take it step by step. We showed in the last segment that the axial current, Ii1, could be found fromVm1 and Vm2.This equation was our result. Let’s say, that we can find this current right here, which I'll denote with the blue arrow, Ii1.Now, if we did that for that segment, we can do it again for another segment. So, I can have another expression for the current in the next segment, Ii2.In Ii2 is all the same things just withVm2 and Vm3 instead of Vm1 and Vm2 it’s just shifted over by one, one setting. Here’s the thing. We know that in electricity, current is conserved. If it goes one place, it has to keep ongoing. It is not created at any one place nor is it destroyed. So, conservation of current, sometimes called Kirchoff's Law, requires that the membrane current, that's site two. This current right here, Im2,It has to be the current that's coming in,this current in blue. Notice the current that's going out, this current in green, and the difference has to go across the membrane, and here it is,is membrane current at site number two. If you want to think about it this way,Suppose a big current,Suppose Ii1 is a big current, suppose Ii2is a tiny current. So, a lot of current is pouring in along the axis to site number two. But it can't go on down the axis because the intracellular current that’s continuing on is just tiny,So it has to be forced out and it is forced out. And that particular current that is forced out from the inside to the outside, we call that Im2.The same thing is true, of course, in the other direction. If Ii1 is tiny, Ii2 is big,Then Im2 has to also be the difference,but this time it will be a negative value because it'll be coming inside. If you do this mathematically, these same steps mathematically, then we get this equation that's on the left,Im2.Now, I'm just subtracting one and two. I take equation one, I subtract equation two, and this is what I get simply by subtraction of two from one. And that difference, then, is this three term series, Vm1 minus two  Vm2 + Vm3..An amazingly complicated expression, often inscrutable when you just see it written out there all by itself, but coming from such a simple origin. So now, we have the units question again. Let’s talk about it just for a minute. As before, the current is in amperes, this is in volts,This is in ohms, and everything is okay. As before, often times this is in millivolts, this is in kiloohms, so this will be in nanoamperes. That's okay, too. But we do have a little problem here. The problem is that in the equation that we really cared about, the one that started us on this path,The units for the membrane current were not amperes but instead they were amperes per meter squared, or some other scaled variant of that. Maybe nanoamperes per centimeter squared. But, in any event, they were a per unit area unit, units that were used in our motivating equation. We want to be able to use our results,We want to be able to use this result in this equation. So, we're going to have to have some kind of a units conversion. Now, you could say, you should start by spelling conversion correctly, but I won't. I'll just go onto the next slide. We can get to the units we want simply by doing a division of the current that we found by the surface area through which it flows. So, the way we do that is take our expression, divide by the surface area, there it is right there. That’s the surface area of an individual segment, the surface area of the cross sectional area, so that will be equal to two pi a times delta x surface area. We take our original expression equation one, divided by the surface area two, then we wind up with equation number three. It’s a little bit confusing looking. But,notice this. In the limit as delta x grows small, we have I'm = one over two pi a, d squared Vm, dx squared where all of it is evaluated at the point of interest. So, if this us Im2, it'll be just derivative evaluated as site number two versus Im3,or four, or seven, they're derivative on the right will likely be evaluated in the same way. So, if you discretize the fiber,when you discretize the fiber, the result you get is this result. This is usually the result that you want if you're doing a numerical calculation. If, on he other hand, you're thinking of the problem mathematically, or looking on a reference book that shows the result mathematically,or lots of times just in discussions of the problem, you get this result Im goes as one over two pi a times d squared Vm dx squared. You're thinking what is this partial derivative sign that discussed[inaudible] on being is just on that way to say that, that it's the second derivative in space even if things are changing in time. So, we have it. We’ve done it. Hurray. We have gotten the trans-membrane current and we've got it from the neighbors and it is the second derivative. That's what provoking. The trans-membrane current is not proportional to the trans-membrane voltage. It's not proportional to the slope of the trans-membrane voltage, it's proportional to the second spacial derivative of the trans-membrane voltage. You're going down the track and you're looking for the bumps because the bumps are where there's,there's big second derivatives. And when there’s a bump on the track, that's where there’s a membrane current in the fiber. In the figure here of the Duke University Dorms, they're interesting because of the bumps. I mean, yes, there is a wall, and yes there are straight lines on the wall,but it's the bumps here. The bumps here,the irregularities there, that's what makes the architecture interesting as is the all case for all Gothic architecture. And in our track, is the bump that get your attention if you're on the train and then the fiber is the bumps that get your attention as far as membrane current. Thank you for watching. We'll come back and look at this another way in the next.</p>
