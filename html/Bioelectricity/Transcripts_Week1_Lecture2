<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_1-.C2.AD2_About_Bioelectricity_.282.29">Week 1-­2 About Bioelectricity (2)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I'm Roger Coke Barr. This is Bioelectricity. Week one, the second segment. Today, we're going to talk about some introductory information. Making plans on the railroad. Studying electricity and solutions and talking about different items of terminology and a little bit of mathematics. But before we start that, let's talk about bioelectricity.  </li>
<li>If you look at this picture, what are the most sophisticated electrical devices that are present here? Is it the touch pad here? Is it this boy? Is it this man? Well from an electrical point of view, by far the most sophisticated, complicated, and automatic, electrical devices, in this picture are the two people, the boy and the man. The tablet computer while a very modern and sophisticated device is relatively speaking, simple.  </li>
<li>So this brings us to the question, why do we care about bioelectricity? We care about bioelectricity because it is us. That's why people have cared about it historically, and that's why people care about it today. It's us, and so we want to know about it, and then obviously it's us, so we want to understand how it works, what the principles are by which it works, and what might go wrong with it. In this course we don't spend much time talking about what goes wrong, but we do spend a lot of time talking about the principles by which things work.  </li>
</ul>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="About_Bioelectricity_.283.29">About Bioelectricity (3)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>First let's just ask, what is bioelectricity? Bioelectricity is a term that's usually used for electricity flowing in living tissue. It includes electrophysiology, the numerous electrical currents that flow naturally. And bioelectricity, that word is usually used to encompass the larger world of currents that are introduced into living systems from the outside. Those might be things like lightening in the extreme but more often things like stimulators or pacemakers to serve a therapeutic function.  </li>
<li>If you say, why is this picture our course icon? It's because that picture shows eyes, and it shows a nose, and it shows ears and a mouth. And these are extremely sophisticated bioelectric sensors, If you want to think about them that way, that is, they sense a light or a sound, smell or taste and they translate through their sensory mechanism, that information into electrical signals.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="When_did_the_study_of_Bioelectricity_begin.3F_.284.29">When did the study of Bioelectricity begin? (4)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>When did the study of bioelectricity began? Well, bioelectricity is sometimes, nowadays, thought of as something that people at electrical engineering got around to once they had invented radio and television and maybe even computers. In actual fact, bioelectricity was one of the subjects at the very beginning of the study of electricity in the 1700s.  </li>
<li>It is said to be the case that bioelectricity infused a competitive and exciting spirit into the study of electricity that was not biological because of a conflict between Galvani, who was a surgeon and who studied electricity in animals, and Volta, who was not medical and who instead studied electricity outside of the living context. Galvani and Volta had, at least in these stories, they had a huge argument and the argument was well, a part of the founding of this subject.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_was_the_Galvani-Volta_conflict_about.3F_.285.29">What was the Galvani-Volta conflict about? (5)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>What was their conflict about? Well, Galvani thought that electricity and living tissue was a whole separate physical and physiological phenomenon. Volta thought no, it's all one thing and that these are different manifestations of one larger set of electrical events.  </li>
<li>We now recognize that Volta was the person who was right in the sense of electricity being unified.   </li>
<li>On the other hand, there are things that are really different about electricity in a biological context.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_is_electricity_in_living_tissue_different_from_the_.E2.80.9Cordinary.E2.80.9D_electricity_of_batteries.2C_wires.2C_radios_and_computers.3F_.286.29">How is electricity in living tissue different from the “ordinary” electricity of batteries, wires, radios and computers? (6)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Now what happens when you throw a fish in the ocean? Well, back up, say what happens when you throw a battery in the ocean?  </li>
<li>If you throw a standard battery in the ocean, and leave it there for three days, which I did this summer at the beach, this battery is one I took and threw in the ocean water. It actually was some water from the ocean in a bucket, and I left it there for three days and I pulled it out. And look at the mess that resulted. This end of the battery we see corrosion, on this end of the battery, the other end, we see more corrosion.  </li>
<li>The battery is utterly destroyed and of course its voltage has been reduced to zero.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_happens_when_you_throw_a_fish_in_the_ocean.3F_.287.29">What happens when you throw a fish in the ocean? (7)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>And as I was saying before, what happens when you throw a fish in the ocean? When you throw a fish in the ocean, the fish is very happy. This is a very happy fish, swimming around in an aquarium with other fish.  </li>
<li>That fish is highly electrical. It maintains voltages all the time. And yet it doesn't become corroded. It just continues to function. If we look over at the right. It's shown here on the right. The ray is an electrical device, you stay away from this part at the end. The ray stays charged all the time. That's how it lives and eats and scares away it's predators. It does not corrode after three days. It's happy in saltwater.  </li>
<li>So if you imagine now an experiment that you could perform, don't do this, but you could do it. You could take your computer and throw it in the ocean. And if you did, your computer would cease working and you would never get it to work again. The salt water environment is so corrosive.  </li>
<li>But on the other hand, you, individually as a biological system, exist in a solution that is similar to salt water. And yet you continue to function day after day for your whole entire life.  </li>
<li>So Galvani was in that sense correct. Living systems are in many specific respects fundamentally different from those of standard electricity.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>So that's the end of this segment of our course. I'll show you a final slide taken this morning August 2012 of the Duke Chapel at Duke University in Durham North Carolina. I walked in front of this building and took this picture. And for this segment we'll say goodbye to our two guys up in the corner. Both biometric systems operating yet another one. Thank you and we will see you in the next, next segment of the course.</p>
