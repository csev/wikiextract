<ul>
<li>Well hello once again, this is Roger Coke Barr. We're into week one of bioelectricity course. And I wanted to add a few comments about the forces that are exerted by electric fields.  </li>
<li>We mentioned in an earlier segment that when you know the potential, you can find the electric field. When you know the electric field, you can find the force.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Electrical_Forces_.28slide_65.29">Electrical Forces (slide 65)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>In this segment, I just wanted to come back again and reemphasize the idea that when there is a force that pushes hard on a molecule or other object with a charge. Now for a, a commonly understood application, think of lightning. The electric fields from the lightning bolt create forces that are large enough to rip apart the molecules in the air, and that results in ions in the air, which can move, and actually are the current associated with the lightning bolt.  </li>
<li>In a more common situation, think of light bulbs. Ordinary light bulbs, electrons in the air, or ions that are in the air, or pushed through wires, pushed through the vapor in a fluorescent tube, by an electric field from one end of the tube to the other. They're pushed hard, hard enough that the glow results.  </li>
<li>And then finally, the reason these forces are most important to us in bioelectricity is within membranes. From one side of the membrane to the other, there are very big electrical forces. And these high forces, resulting from high fields are the forces that allow the membrane to twist and turn and decide whether to allow potassium ions through or sodium ions or some other kind of cross-molecular movement.  </li>
<li>I mention all this because somehow are other, seems like people think of bioelectricity and they imagine, well whatever it is that's happening there is kind of wimpy. The wimpiness is associated with the thought that well it's just biology. It can't really be strong, but it's very strong.  </li>
<li>The electrical forces are very strong. And you really do have to accept that idea to understand what is going on.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fields_can_be_big_.28slide_66.29">Fields can be big (slide 66)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Now how do you get such a big force? Well, you get a big field when the change in potential is big. But we don't have big changes in potential.  </li>
<li>Our changes in potential are at most about 1/10 of a volt.  </li>
<li>But the other way of getting a big field is to have a very small change in distance. And when the change in potential occurs over a very small change in distance, the electric field will be very high, which then means the force can be very high.  </li>
<li>Where does that occur in bioelectricity? Well, that occurs across membranes because membranes are very thin.  </li>
<li>So when you have 1/10 of a volt change across the very thin membrane, a very large electrical force results.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fields_can_be_big_.28slide_67.29">Fields can be big (slide 67)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>So this slide says that again and emphasizes the fact that when you come to membranes that you have to say mm-hm, these potential differences may be small but they are associated with electrical fields that are big.  </li>
<li>And as a result, the forces associated with those electric fields are very big indeed.   </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>That's the end of this segment. Thank you for watching. We'll see you in the next segment.</p>
