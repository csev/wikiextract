					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Greetings once again. I'm Roger Coke Barr your instructor for Bioelectricity. We're in week number three now. I hope that you are still remembering week number two: You're thinking about all those pumps that are pumping, and all those excitable membranes in your arms and legs and everywhere else in your whole entire body.  </p>
<p>This week, we talk about the uses that are made of the concentration differences. How they create current flows that then are turned into action potentials and begin to make big composite events that move from place to place. The starting point for this week is to talk about channels. Channels are the mechanism by which individual ions move in and out of excitable membranes. If you don't know about this subject, then I can assure you that the way that channels actually work is not what you are thinking. Let's get started.</p>
