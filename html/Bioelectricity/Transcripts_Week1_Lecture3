<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Major_Sections_1-3">Major Sections 1-3</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>So, hello again. This is Roger Coke Barr for the Bio-electricity course. This segment is for week one and it is the third lecture in the week one series. I thought it might be interesting and useful to look at the various weeks of the whole course here in the first week so you have an idea of what is coming up and why that's of interest.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_the_weeks_of_the_course.3F_Week_1_.2810.29">What are the weeks of the course? Week 1 (10)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The first week, the week we're in now, talks about some items of background, as you know. In a little bit, it talks about a topic called rectification of names, which you might think of as terminology but it involves how things are called. How things are called is really important since we're dealing with quantities and events that are invisible. So, since their invisible, in speaking about them to each other it's very, very necessary that there be common conventions on what things are called.  </li>
<li>Then, in the third segment of this week, we'll talk about the rules of electricity and solutions. That is a really interesting topic and you'll enjoy hearing about it.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_2_.2811.29">Week 2 (11)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>In the second week, in our railroad analogy, we're trying to get some money by selling tickets. In the bioelectricity world, our real world, we're talking about how the membrane gets energy from it's surrounding environment. Oh, this is really tricky stuff. And when you understand it, you'll understand something that is marvelous, and fantastic, and remarkable, and really not like electricity as you think of it ordinarily.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_3_.2812.29">Week 3 (12)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>In week three, we are really in to the study of membranes. And in particular, membrane channels. Membrane channels are where ions go through the membrane through special structures which are called channels. The membrane derives its power from this process. And in that sense, channels are analogous on the train to the engine. It is where the energy comes from that makes things happen.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_4_.2812.29">Week 4 (12)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>In week four, we'll talk about action potentials. For many people, action potentials are the heart of bioelectricity. When you understand action potentials, you'll understand biolectricity field.  </li>
<li>Here by analogy, I've used the analogy of train cars because action potentials are a series of events like train cars occurring one after another, after another, after another but not randomly.  </li>
<li>They're very tightly synchronized.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_5_.2813.29">Week 5 (13)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>In week five, we'll talk about the structure, that is to say, if it's cells or a long axon or whatever, that channels the currents and where they flow. And the way that happens is just absolutely remarkable. In the bioelectricity world, the tissue structure channels the currents so that action potentials occur at one side after another in a chain reaction fashion. This is why an event can propagate along a nerve. This is why a muscle can contract pretty much all at once.
And, this is why the tissue structure, while not itself electrical, controls what the electricity is doing. It's really very much like a train track.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_6_.2814.29">Week 6 (14)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Week six involves, our train rolling on down the track. Or in the bioelectricity sense, propagation. Propagation is where things are happening at one side, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next. Just like the train going. It is what really makes bioelectricity significant in a physiological sense.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_7_.2815.29">Week 7 (15)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>In week seven, we'll talked about observations of the train going down the track. I mean, this subject is of interest in part because we get to watch it from the outside. So, that's the basis of electrocardiograms and the heart electroencephalographs of the brain.  </li>
<li>Lots of other electrical measurements of electrically active nerves and muscles, excitable tissue. And the fact that you can watch what's happening while never actually penetrating the structure, is on the one hand amazing and then on the other hand remarkably useful. </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_8_.2816.29">Week 8 (16)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>And then in the final week of the course, we talked some about the ability to control propagation, to control it's initiation and to stop propagation by means of stimulation.  </li>
<li>Of course, electrical stimulation possibly is most commonly known in the general public as because of cardiac pacemakers and other kinds of neuro stimulators. It is just a most interesting topic, essentially how can you stay outside and yet still influence what happens.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_the_weeks_of_the_course.3F_.2817.29">What are the weeks of the course? (17)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>So, that will be our course. If you looked at the weeks taken as a whole, they're eight of course. And the most important part of the structure of the weeks is probably to realize that in the middle, these topics are like a group where each topic is, could be done first, but you have to do all three and then the collection as a whole is what allows you to talk about propagation.  </li>
<li>So, the first thing we do is to make plans. The next thing we do is to talk about where the energy to do anything comes from. Then, we do this group of three. You might say really into the very heart of this subject and when we done those three we can talk about propagation.  </li>
<li>Once propagation has been completed, then it's possible to talk about watching propagation from the outside of the active tissue and control the propagation so as to make it do what you want it to do.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>So, with this picture of the Duke Chapel we'll close this segment. I think you'll enjoy this course and I think you'll enjoy each topic individually. And then, of course, the way the topics work when you take them as a whole.</p>
