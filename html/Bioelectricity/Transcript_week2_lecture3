<p><strong>Bioelectricity week 2.3 (slide 7)</strong><br />
Well hello again. This is Roger Coke Barr for Bioelectricity week two, segment three. In this segment we're talking about energy as it converted into the form of transmembrane voltage, Vm, and in particular we're thinking about that in a patch of membrane.  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Vm Across the Membrane Patch (slide 8)</strong><br />
<ul><li> So you might say, what is the problem that we are talking about? The problem is, if you have a piece of membrane, it's sitting there like a little piece of shrink wrap and there's no voltage from one side to the other. It's just sitting there. It might say it's sitting there floating around in the salt water. There's an inside and an outside because it's wrapped, being enclosed.<br />
</li><li> Nonetheless there's no voltage from one side to the other. At least not there automatically. That's the problem that has to be solved. We've gotta get some voltages across the membrane or we don't have anything to work with to make anything happen, electrically.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>How does the membrane charge itself up? (slide 9)</strong><br />
<ul><li> So the issue is, now we have this membrane, how does it charge itself up? It's a little bit unnatural when you ask that because most batteries don't charge themselves up. There are a few that are rechargeable from external sources, but we don't normally think of batteries charging themselves up.<br />
</li><li> Yet, membranes can charge themselves up, and this is how they do it. They do it in two steps.<br />
</li><li> First, they pump potassium and sodium, potassium in and sodium out. They do this pumping action so that both kinds of ions, potassium and sodium, move across the membrane at the same time. They do it with millions and billions of little teeny tiny pumps.<br />
</li><li> Then, after they do that, the membrane leaks the ions back out, but it does so selectively. Potassium goes out, all by itself, with hardly any sodium leaking in. Let's go forward.<br />
</li><li> We'll come back and think about that idea in a lot of detail in the very next segment. But it's such a big, big idea, the idea that the potassium is pumped to have unequal concentrations, and then it's leaked out in order to create a voltage, that I wanted to make it a segment all its own. Thank you.</p>
</li></ul>
