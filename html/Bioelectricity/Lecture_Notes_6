<p><strong>S1<em>S2</em>15 msec</strong><br />

<p><strong>S1<em>S2</em>9 msec</strong><br />
<ul><li> 1st stim gives APs 2nd gives none<br />
</li><li> Why?  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Why 2nd gives none</strong>
At end of 2nd stim:  </p>
<p><strong>No 2nd AP, summary</strong><br />
<ul><li> For the stimulus to produce an action potential, at the end of the stimulus INa has to be greater than IK, so that Vm keeps on rising.<br />
</li><li> That occurs in the 1st stimulus.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>At the end of the 2nd stimulus, the situation is that
<ul><li> INa is lower than at the end of the 1st, because m is lower and h is about the same.<br />
</li><li> IK is higher than at the end of the 1st stimulus, because n is higher<br />
</li><li> So INa does not exceed IK at the end of the 2nd stimulus<br />
</li><li> Consequently, there is no subsequent Vm rise nor is there a subsequent 2nd AP.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>little question</strong><br />
Why is m so much lower at the end of the 2nd stimulus, as compared to the end of the 1st?
The 2 reasons are:  </p>

<p>Movie of Giant Squid in Action<br />
Start the imagination machine<br />
Movie at museum of natural history, washington, dc, usa  </p>
<p><strong>velocity -Q</strong><br />
A squid plans to find food in a more dangerous location. So as to be a little quicker in escaping from predators the squid wants to make propagation along its giant axon go 3 times as fast. Unfortunately, the squid has no ability to change the axon membrane itself, nor its surroundings, but the squid can change the axon’s diameter. To achieve 3x velocity, the squid needs to make the axon’s new diameter, in relation to the present one:
I. (a) 1/9th as much (b) 1/3rd as much (c) 3x as much (d) 9x as much<br />
II. Why wouldn’t this change be good for all squids, all the time?  </p>

<li>A sub threshold rectangular current stimulus produces a voltage deflection at the site of stimulation, but there is nothing propagated.  </li>
</ul>
<p>: “Put in a pulse and it goes down the fiber” is not (always) true.  </p>
<ul>
<li>A threshold (or larger) stimulus initiates propagated APs.  </li>
<li>Increasing the magnitude of the stimulus does not increase propagation velocity.  </li>
<li>Stimulating from both ends excites in both directions until collision in the center.  </li>

<li>The velocity is higher in fibers that have a larger diameter, other things being the same.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All</strong><br />
1. A sub threshold rectangular current stimulus produces a voltage deflection at the site of stimulation, but there is nothing propagated.<br />
2. A threshold (or larger) stimulus initiates propagated APs.<br />
3. Increasing the magnitude of the stimulus does not increase propagation velocity.<br />
4. Stimulating from both ends excites in both directions until collision in the center.   There is no pass through (stored energy has been used)<br />
5. Stimuli at 15msec intervals initiates an AP following each one, but at an interval of 9 msec there is no AP following the 2nd stimulus.<br />
6. The velocity is higher in fibers that have a larger diameter, other things being the same.  </p>
