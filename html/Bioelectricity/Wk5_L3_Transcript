<p>Hello once again. This is Roger Coke Barr for the Bioelectricity course. We’re in Week five, Ssgment three. In the past segment, we were talking about how, when you lay track. You have to be conscious of the fact that each, each place on the ground connects with its neighbors. You have to be conscious of whether you’re going uphill or downhill. You have to be conscious of whether you’re going across a stream or up a mountain. It’s similar in bioelectricity when you begin to talk about currents. When you talk about currents, you have to think about what kind of tissue am I in. What are these, what is the physical and physiological structure because I'd like to know how currents are moving from one place to another. Before getting into the details of analyzing a particular case, let's look at some alternatives. Just to have some idea of what is what are different kinds of structures that have to be considered as one considers a range of different kinds of tissue. So, the simplest structure is that of a uniform cylindrical fiber. This diagrammatically, we just do it like this. One simple centrical fiber in a tissue structure sense, very simple. Although what happens within it can be rather complicated. As an alternative, think of a bundle of cylindrical fibers. So, if I draw a cross section. Here’s may be the outer sheath of the bundle, but within it, there may be lots of fibers. So the whole space is filled up with many many individual fibers within the sheet. To our first approximation, all these fibers inside, act as if they were independent, individual fibers. But they, they're performance may be affected by the fact that there are others nearby. If for no reason other than the, the adjacent fibers are using up space, and making it harder for the extracellular current to flow. Of course, there's still other structures. Maybe one fiber comes along and it branches. And maybe in the process of branching, the diameter of the fiber changes. So, one then must take into account both the fact that towards the end, there are two rather than one. But then, also the fact that the diameter over here is small and the diameter over here is big. All those things will affect how current flows from one place to another. And then, for the heart and for the brain especially, but in many other particular cases, you have large numbers of small cells, and they're all clustered together in a very tight packing. These may be 2D clusters, two-dimensional sheets of cells as is true, more or less in the cardiac atrium or this may be a big three-dimensional mass of cells, where rather than trying to draw a cell by cell, I'll just make a line, but where there’s an entire volume of space that's filled up with small cells. We think of that most especially in connection with the brain, but it can occur in clusters in a three-dimensional sense in other kinds of tissues as well. So, in our course, we don't have time to examine lots of different tissue structures, interesting though that would be. Instead, what has been done here is we work only on the uniform cylindrical fiber, this case does not have myelination which is a material surrounding the fiber and that makes it conduct fast and the fiber is located in an infinite volume. These are all simplifications. In a certain sense, you would say, this is the simplest. Model that incorporates all of the major structural features that must be present. There are two good reasons for starting with this model. One, is that most other issue models, start from here. People first understand how the cylindrical fiber works and then they modify it or build on it to get a more complicated structure. The corollary is the uniform fiber model is the easiest to understand. So, we’re trying to get the main idea of what works and we want the structure to be present but we don't want it to be so complicated, it gets in the way of gaining that initial understanding. So, as we go forward here and for the rest of our course, our special structure will be the uniform cylindrical fiber. So, blue flowers, as you know, are special flowers and here's a not very uniform and not very cylindrical Duke campus flower. Which I took a picture of just yesterday and I thought you would enjoy seeing it. Thank you. See you in the next segment.</p>
