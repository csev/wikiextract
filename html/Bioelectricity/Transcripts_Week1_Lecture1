<p>Greetings and welcome to Bioelectricity. My name is Roger Coke Barr. I am the instructor for the course. Bioelectricity is a subject that has been kept for too long in a little box that's been...had a combination known only by people in a rather small club. I'm really happy to be teaching this course because I see this as a chance to bring bioelectricity out into a much wider world. With your help, we will do it. </p>
<p>Now in this first week, I was thinking that the thing to do is to lay the foundation for all eight weeks of the course. There are a few things we need to do. One is we need to talk a little bit about the history, so you know where we're starting from. Then we need to talk a little bit about some specialized terminology that's used in the field. And what's going to happen in the different weeks.</p>
<p>I think you'll find this interesting and fun to listen to. Our most substantial work for the week will be talking a little bit about the fundamental roles of bio-electricity which are the same as all of electricity but applied a bit differently in the cases of people and solutions.</p>
<p>So now bioelectricity is very significant to every one of us. We are all bioelectric creatures. Let's get started.</p>
