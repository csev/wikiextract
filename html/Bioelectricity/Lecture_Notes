<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_1-.C2.AD2_About_Bioelectricity_.28_slide_2.29">Week 1-­2 About Bioelectricity ( slide 2)</span></h3>
<p><strong>What is Bioelectricity?</strong><br />
<ul><li> From an electrical point of view, by far the most sophisticated, complicated, and automatic, electrical devices, in this picture are the two people.<br />
</li><li> Why do we care about bioelectricity? We care about bioelectricity because it is us.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="About_Bioelectricity_.28slide_3.29">About Bioelectricity (slide 3)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually refers to electricity flowing through living tissues</li>
<li>Includes electrophysiology, electricity that enters into living things (e.g. lightening)  </li>
<li>Why is this picture our course icon? It is because that picture shows eyes, a nose, ears and a mouth. And these are extremely sophisticated bioelectric sensors.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="When_did_the_study_of_Bioelectricity_begin.3F_.28slide_4.29">When did the study of Bioelectricity begin? (slide 4)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bioelectricity was one of the subjects at the very beginning of the study of electricity in the 1700s.  </li>
<li>It is said to be the case that bioelectricity infused a competitive and exciting spirit into the study of electricity that was not biological because of a conflict between Galvani, who was a surgeon and who studied electricity in animals, and Volta, who was not medical and who instead studied electricity outside of the living context.  </li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_was_the_Galvani-Volta_conflict_about.3F_.285.29">What was the Galvani-Volta conflict about? (5)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Galvani thought that electricity and living tissue was a whole separate physical and physiological phenomenon.  </li>
<li>Volta thought it is all one thing and that these are different manifestations of one larger set of electrical events.  </li>
<li>We now recognize that Volta was the person who was right in the sense of electricity being unified.  </li>
<li>On the other hand, there are things that are really different about electricity in a biological context.  </li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_is_electricity_in_living_tissue_different_from_the_.E2.80.9Cordinary.E2.80.9D_electricity_of_batteries.2C_wires.2C_radios_and_computers.3F_.286.29">How is electricity in living tissue different from the “ordinary” electricity of batteries, wires, radios and computers? (6)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you throw a standard battery in the ocean, and leave it there for 3 days, the battery is utterly destroyed and of course its voltage has been reduced to zero.  </li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_happens_when_you_throw_a_fish_in_the_ocean.3F_.287.29">What happens when you throw a fish in the ocean? (7)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>When you throw a fish in the ocean, the fish is very happy.  </li>
<li>The fish is highly electrical.  </li>
<li>It maintains voltages all the time, and yet it does not become corroded. It just continues to function.  </li>
<li>Biological system, exist in a solution that is similar to salt water.  </li>
<li>Galvani was in that sense correct: living systems are in many specific respects fundamentally different from those of standard electricity.   </li>

<p><strong>Channels</strong><br />
<ul><li> Study of membrane channels.<br />
</li><li> Membrane channels are where ions go through the membrane through special structures which are called channels. The membrane derives its power from this process.  </p>
</li></ul>

</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_5_.28slide_14.29">Week 5 (slide 14)</span></h3>
<p><strong>Currents within the tissue structure</strong><br />

<p><strong>Propogation</strong><br />

<ul>
<li>The first thing we do is to make plans.  </li>
<li>The next thing we do is to talk about where the energy to do anything comes from.  </li>
<li>Then, we do this group of 3 (channels, action potentials, and currents in structure).  </li>
<li>When we have done those 3, we can talk about propagation. Once propagation has been completed, then it is possible to talk about watching propagation from the outside of the active tissue and control the propagation so as to make it do what you want it to do.  </li>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rectification_of_Names_.28slide_21.29">Rectification of Names (slide 21)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The idea is taken from the Confucian doctrine that social harmony is achieved by using the proper designations for things.</li>
<li>Bioelectricity deals with invisible things (problem) and some conventions have been adopted to name the abstact things that are its elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Membranes_.28slide_22.29">Membranes (slide 22)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The lipid bilayer is a thin material around cells.  </li>
<li>It is made of 2 layers of lipid molecules.  </li>
<li>One end (circles) is hydrophilic.  </li>
<li>The middle (lines) is hydrophobic.  </li>
<li>The lipid bilayer is thin in comparison to a cell diameter. In this illustration, the cell diameter is 200,000 Angstroms, while the lipid bilayer is only 80A.<br />
<strong>KEY ASPECT:</strong> super good insulator and at the same time, is very very thin  </li>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Positive_Membrane_Voltage_.26_Positive_Membrane_Current_.2823.29">Positive Membrane Voltage &amp; Positive Membrane Current (23)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Im positive means current is going from inside to outside.  </li>
<li>Vm: positive lead inside, so +1 mV means inside more positive than outside.     </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Passive means that electrical properties, such as resistance, are maintained without change as time passes.  </li>
<li>Active means that, following some trigger, properties such as resistance can change.  </li>
<li>A dead alligator is passive.  </li>
<li>A live alligator can be passive, but don’t count on it.  </li>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_natural_number_e_.28slide_27.29">The natural number e (slide 27)</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lowercase e stands for the natural number e, and it is a specific number, 2.718.  </li>
<li>e is like pi, in the sense that both are symbols that stand for particular numbers and the numbers have an infinite number of significant digits. They're non-repeating, and so, it's really better to use the symbol because then, everybody's referring to the same number.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>ion = an atom or molecule with a charge due to an unequal number of protons (+) and electrons (-)  </li>
<li>Presence of ions gives a solution electrical conductivity because ions move.  </li>
<li>For example, in water ordinary table salt (NaCl) divides into sodium and chloride ions, Na+ and Cl-­.  </li>
<li>Each is charged because an electron is taken from Na and added to Cl, leaving Na+ as net positive, and Cl-­ as net negative.  </li>

<ul>
<li>To get the resistance of the walls of a cubical container filled with a solution of known resistivity, multiply the resistivity by the length and divide by the cross--‐sectional area. The result will be in Ohms.</li>
<li>For example, if the resistivity ρ is 25 Ohm-­‐cm, what is the resistance along a box with length 10cm if the cross section is square with each edge 5cm?</li>
<li>r = 25 Ohms-­‐cm /(5cm * 5cm) = 1 Ohm/cm  </li>
<li>R = r * L = 1 Ohm/cm * 10 cm = 10 Ohms  </li>

<li>The electric field goes down the potential hill, not up.  </li>
<li>It's the negative of the gradient of potential.  </li>

<ul>
<li>Answer: From sources and sinks.  </li>
<li>The way you know if a point is a source is drawing a closed surface around the point and totaling the current through the surface.  </li>
<li>Is the field point a source?  </li>
<li>There is current at the field point, but no, there it is not a source because all of the current that comes into the envelope goes out of the envelope.  </li>
<li>So as a result, the total current coming out of the field point is equal to zero. Well, the total current going into the field point is equal to zero. Everything that comes in goes out.   </li>

<li>The ideas that are here, in this particular segment, are most important because you just have to have an idea of what these quantities are qualitatively because we talk about them all the time.  </li>
<li>And then furthermore, you have to have the concept in mind that when you know the potential, you can get the electric field.  </li>
<li>When you have the electric field you can get the forces on charges and other charge particles, molecules, ions.  </li>
<li>When you have the forces, you can get the currents.  </li>
<li>When you have the currents, you can get the sources.  </li>
<li>When you have the sources, you can get back to the potentials again.  </li>
