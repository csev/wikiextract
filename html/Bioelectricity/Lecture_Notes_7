<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_we_talking_about.3F">What are we talking about?</span></h3>
<p>With all electrodes outside of cells, possibly on the skin:
<ul><li> Observing voltages between these electrodes
</li><li> Seeing that the voltages change with time.
</li><li> Trying to make some sense of what is seen.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>Augustus Waller, late 1800s
<ul><li> Trained his bulldog, Jimmy, to stand in 4 buckets of water<br />
</li><li> Measured the voltages between the buckets<br />
</li><li> Observed that the signal was periodic
</li><li> Observed that the biggest signal had a period that corresponded to the period of the dog's heart.<br />
</li><li> Also observed the need to feed Jimmy periodically  </p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Finger_wave_forms">Finger wave forms</span></h3>
<p><strong>Recording between finger on one hand and finger on the other (A simple experiment)</strong><br />
Simple experiment: Place electrodes on a finger of each hand and record the voltages from one electrode to the other.  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/images/7/7f/BE-week7-finger-waveform.png" class="image"><img alt="BE-week7-finger-waveform.png" src="/wiki/images/7/7f/BE-week7-finger-waveform.png" width="665" height="233" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Caution – Safety Issue</strong><br />
Caution: Trying this experiment is not a part of this course. Please be aware that an approved experimental protocol may be required.<br />
There can be a shock hazard because there are electrodes tightly coupled to the body. Be sure to use approved equipment to avoid any shock hazard.  </p>
<p><strong>Noise, because signals are small.</strong><br />
<ul><li> “Noise” is often defined as any unwanted signal.<br />
</li><li> If our interest on the recording is the cardiac signal, there is a lot of noise on the recording from body electrodes.<br />
</li><li> Noise is an issue in most kinds of extracellular recordings.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong><br />
<ul><li> The recording shows a voltage that changes with time.<br />
</li><li> There are periodic large signals perhaps 0.8 sec apart.<br />
</li><li> There are a lot of lower level deflections.<br />
</li><li> How do we begin to understand what is happening? Where is this stuff coming from?  </p>
</li></ul>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Single_Fiber_Extracellular_Wave_Forms">Single Fiber Extracellular Wave Forms</span></h3>
<p>What is happening outside the fiber, for a single fiber?<br />
First, let’s look at the wave forms that are observed.  </p>
<p><strong>Experimental setup</strong>  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/images/8/8b/BE-week7-experiment-setup.png" class="image"><img alt="BE-week7-experiment-setup.png" src="/wiki/images/8/8b/BE-week7-experiment-setup.png" width="665" height="289" /></a>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Single fiber, uniform, so it has the most simple structure.  </li>
<li>One stimulator, designated R (towards the left-hand of the fiber).  </li>
<li>2 electrodes<br />
<dl><dd><ul><li> 1 electrode is a penetrating electrode, will tell us the transmembrane voltage.<br />
</li><li> The other electrode is an electrode outside the fiber, which will tell us the voltage outside, relative to a reference that's a long distance away.  </li>
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
</ul>
<p><strong>Single Fiber Xmem and Extra-cellular</strong>  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/images/e/e1/BE-week7-single-fiber-waveform.png" class="image"><img alt="BE-week7-single-fiber-waveform.png" src="/wiki/images/e/e1/BE-week7-single-fiber-waveform.png" width="665" height="368" /></a>  </p>

<p><strong>Ends Setup</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Extra Ends Wave Forms</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Single Fiber Xmem and Extra-cellular</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Wave Shape as Discriminant</strong><br />
<ul><li> Extra cellular wave forms can be used to determine the excitaiton sequence.<br />
</li><li> The wave shape is useful, as well as wave timing.<br />
</li><li> For biphasic waveforms, the upstroke of the action potential corresponds to the intrinsic deflection of the extracellular wave form.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_of_Ve.2C_An_Experiment">Origin of Ve, An Experiment</span></h3>
<p><strong>Origin of Ve experiment, the Setup</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Origin of Ve, Vm(t) to Vm(x)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Origin of Ve, Im(x) to Ve(t)</strong>  </p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Sources and Sinks, Drawing</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Equation</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Straight-edge estimation from Vm(x)</strong>  </p>
<hr />
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Magnitude_of_Io">Magnitude of Io</span></h3>
<p><strong>Magnitude and Sign of Io</strong><br />
<ul><li> We need<br />
</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li> the resistivity [Ri = 30, Re=20 Ohm-cm here] the radius [a= 10 um in most cases here] 
</li><li> the 2nd spatial derivative of Vm  </p>
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<p>:* How does one find an actual number value for Io?<br />
Or, we need a graph of Im(x). That is never available, experimentally, though sometimes it is, in a simulation.  </p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Electrocardiograms">Electrocardiograms</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Electrocardiography is about obtaining and interpreting written records of the electrical signals of the heart.  </li>
<li>Einthoven, in Holland, received the Nobel Prize in 1924 for demonstrating that the electrocardiogram was systematically different in patients with different kinds of heart problems.  </li>
<li>The best way to interpret electrical signals from the heart remains a research topic even today.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heart within Body, Sketch</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Lead Waveforms</strong><br />
<ul><li> ECGSIM is a fantastic computer tool for visualizing and connecting electrical signals in the heart with those on the body surface.<br />
</li><li> It has been created and made available by Adriaan van Oosterom and colleagues, who are authorities in this field.<br />
</li><li> www.ecgsim.org (Available for many purposes free of charge.)  </p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Problem_session.2C_sources_as_dipoles">Problem session, sources as dipoles</span></h3>
<p><strong>Source pairs as dipoles - Q</strong><br />
<ul><li> Derive an expression that gives the potential from a sourcesink pair in a single term.<br />
</li><li> Assume that the distance between the source and sink is much smaller than the distance to the field point.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Hints</strong><br />
<ul><li> Derive an expression that gives the potential from a sourcesink pair in a single term.  * Assume that the distance between the source and sink is much smaller than the distance to the field point.<br />
</li><li> Think of the distance from the sink to the source as a vector p. Think of the distance from the pair to the field point as another vector r.<br />
</li><li> The result will depend on the dot product of these 2 vectors.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ol>
<li><p>Extracellular voltages are present across fingers, with a complex wave shape, though a heartbeat is visible.  </p></li>
<li><p>.A much simpler wave shape, largely biphasic, is seen from an extracellular electrode near a single fiber.  </p></li>
<li><p>The leading edge of the excitation wave, seen outside the fiber, has positive potential and the trailing edge is negative.  </p></li>
<li><p>Sources and sinks are readily identify from the curve of Vm(x) or Im(x)  </p></li>
<li><p>Though the geometry is hugely different, wave shapes of similar polarity arise from excitation waves in the heart.  </p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>An enormous and wide-ranging subject</strong><br />
<ul><li> We have barely scratched the surface.<br />
</li><li> The recording and interpretation of extracellular signals is an enormous and wide-ranging subject.<br />
</li><li> The industry devoted to manufacture of specialized instruments for recording and display is large and varied.<br />
</li><li> The modes and principles of wave form interpretation is highly developed by specialists in related medical fields, for example, by cardiologists for wave forms from the heart.  </p>
