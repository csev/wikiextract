<p>Hello again. This is Roger Coke Barr for the bioelectricity course and we're starting week 5 of our course. Thank you for being here. We have an exciting but different topic today. We're going to talk this week about currents in the structure. By analogy, we are talking about the track on which the train runs. Please keep in mind, as you think about this topic, that this is one of the three topics, three, four, five, one of the three topics that could be taken in any order. So, topic number five is independent of topics three and topic four. So talking about the track is really fundamentally different. As compared to what we have done up until this time. We are now for the first time not staying in place in one little patch on the membrane, but rather examining what happens as currents flow from one place to another. There are two aspects of this for which we need quantitative results. The first, which I've called axial currents inside and outside. Are the currents that flow from one place to another, either in the space inside the cells or in the space outside the cells. The second is a consequence of the first,at some point along the fiber, the fact the current stopped flowing inside forces them outside. At other points along the fiber or in a group of cells the fact the currents start flowing inside means the current has to come through the membrane from the outside. So we want to know what about these membrane currents that are forced to be present. By the need to supply, or to get rid of,the axial currents. These are our two major topics for the week. So, we have two groups of topics that I’ve divided as usual. In the first, this, the first, we’ll emphasize that this week is a little different from what we have done so far. And in particular, we will have to get straight a bunch of little things. All these are just little things that we have to get straight in order to deal with the track, rather than with the train. Where the ball electricity sense, there are little things we have to get straight in order to deal with currents moving from one place to another place. You won't find any of these very hard,it's not a matter of difficulty. It’s a matter of having them in mind. Then at the second part of the week. This part,We make use of all those little facts,bring them together, find the axial currents and find the trans-membrane currents which is really what are objective is. As we start this week let's look at the terms in the equation that we have used over and over. We have frequently begun with the equation IM equals IC plus Iion. The total membrane current is the capacitive current plus the sum of the ionic currents for active tissue. In earlier weeks we have for a patch examined the capacity current. So that part is done. Last week, in an intensive set of individual segments, we examined the Hodgkin-Huxley model for ionic currents. So that part is done. This week we take the third item in that trio and we're saying the total membrane current, this comes from the neighbors. Let’s examine this week and see how that’s done so that our action potentials can move from one place to another. It’s great news. Now all of a sudden our patch is not isolated from nearby patches. And of course that's absolutely essential because we want action potentials to travel along a nerve so as to carry information from one place to another. We want electrical signals to move through the heart so that the whole heart beats. We want electrical signals to move from place to place within the brain as new thoughts are formed. So the functional value neurophysiology is intimately tied to this idea of a patch being tied to its friends nearby. It’s not isolated. Mathematically speaking,Up until now, we've always assigned IM is equal to zero. And we did that because we didn't know any current that was coming from the neighbors. We just wanted to test what was happening in our patch in isolation. And the way to do that was to say, well,whatever the current is in the patch must stay in the patch or in other words, IM is equal to zero. There is a little bit of exception there where we have introduced a stimulus current for a short while. But this really had nothing to do with the neighbors. You will find that when there are lots of patches, and there always are lots of patches in naturally occurring tissue. One patch has a strong effect on what happens in the next patch, and that patch on the ones beside it. So, there is a chain reaction type of operation. Each one has an effect on the others. And, mathematically, this effect of each patch on the next is expressed by changes in the value of the membrane current, IM..There's another thing. Up until now, we've talked about patches in isolation, with very little need to talk about the specific structure from which they came. We’ve mentioned along the way, frog muscle, squid axon but by and large, we’ve talked about patches all alone in the world. Well, it's just not like that anymore. Things are different now. We’re examining how one patch interacts with its neighbors. And to do that, we have to do that for a particular tissue structure. So in this segment with this picture of some dead campus flowers. As you know flower bushes one flower has an affect on the others, these travel from place to place the whole entire process in nature depends not just on individual flowers as important as they are, but on their interactions and their interactions with their surroundings so there can be flowers this year, next year and the year after. Let's see just how this works in the subsequent segments.</p>
