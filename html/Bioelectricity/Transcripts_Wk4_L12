<p>So hello again. This is Bioelectricity. I'm Roger Coke Barr. This week four of the course and we're in the final segment of week four, the weekend review. This week has involved a lots and lots of  details as well as the big picture of the Hodgkin and Huxley model for active tissue. Let's just look through it all once again, so as to be sure that each of these puzzle pieces is placed in its right location in the overall picture that you're assembling in your mind.  </p>
<p>We started the week with a mystery. Where did the action potential come from? What was its mechanism? The HH model gave us the answer. The resistive current in the passive model was replaced by three ionic currents. And, notably, each of these currents had a probabilistic basis, that is, probabilities were used to find the amount of current at each moment. The most important part of HH model was that it was possible to use it to move from one time to the next. Thereby, we could trace out the time history of the trans-membrane potential, whether in terms of the action potential voltage itself, or in terms of the underlying events, such as the ionic currents, or even the conductivities of the tissue. From the perspective of energy, which we started the course with. We started the week with no apparent source of energy for the big voltage changes that were seen in the active tissues' responses. Let me do that again.   </p>
<p>In week four, we started the week with no source of energy. We were out of gas. Out of gas. We couldn't do anything. There was no way to figure out how to get any big bump after the little external stimulus. The Hodgkin-Huxley model showed us how to handle that situation. In particular, it linked into the calculation, the energy stored in the membrane. Now we knew there was energy stored in the membrane because we had talked about that quite a bit in week two of the course, but we hadn't put it into the active tissue model until we included the Hodgkin-Huxley calculations. They got it in there by including those batteries EK, ENa, and EL that where the encapsulation of that balance of the forces of diffusion, and the forces of the electric field that we had talked about so extensively before. That has a big ramification.  The Hodgkin-Huxley model by linking the membrane model to the energy stored in the membrane means that now the membrane has energy to run itself. You could put this rather poignantly by saying Bye-bye Istim, I really don't need
you anymore. I can just run things fine all by myself. Because I have my own energy, I can do it by myself. And indeed that's what your tissue does. If it's in your heart, it does it by itself. Little bit modulated, but basically byitself. No external stimulus to keep it going. That's what's happening in your brain. Now on the other hand, in you AS and then your sensory system there are stimuli that are provided by outside events. So if you look at the range of electrically active tissue, sometimes there is and sometimes there is not an outside stimulus but it is no longer necessary because we see how the membranehas its own energy sources and can run itself when it wants to. In that sense, I have people who come to teach, sorry, I have people who come to be students in a Bioelectricity Course who know a lot about Electrical Engineering and in particular they know a lot about pulse transmission in coaxial cables and they really, really, really want electrical activity, especially in nerves to be the same thing as pulse transmission in a coaxial cables Well, most people say, "Sorry, Charlie, this is just not at all like pulse transmission in coaxial cable." No, no, no. And coaxial cable does not bring it's own energy with it whereas nerves in fact do as do all excitable tissues. We'll end this week with these multiple insights. With this fascinating statue from the Duke Campus which shows a camel, along with Professor Knut Schmidt- Nielsen who studied camels in many of their respects. And unraveled many of their mysteries. And in this statue you see the camel watching Knut and Knut watching the camel. Each one trying to figure the other one out. Thank you for watching.</p>
