<p><strong>Bioelectricity week 2.6 (slide 24)</strong><br />
<ul><li> Hello again. This is the Bioelectricity course, week two, segment six. I'm Roger Coke Barr and I am glad to talk to you today.<br />
</li><li> We are trying to develop an understanding of the batteries that were on the bioelectric system. The energy sources and the voltages, and where they come from? And with any battery system, how long the battery last is an absolutely essential, part of its, design and determines the functions for which it is useful.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Energy: Battery Lifetime? (slide 25)</strong><br />
<ul><li> So let's just say what is the problem and it is useful to look again at the picture from last week where we looked at a ordinary battery, a nice battery, brand new thrown in the ocean. Three days later it was corroded and looked just miserable. So we have all these things over here and all these things over here. And of course there's no voltage left. Well, that's an extreme case because I took a battery and used it in a way for which it was not designed by throwing into salt water. And of course, that made a mess of it.<br />
</li><li> However, if you think of batteries that are made by humans, normal batteries, if you use them continuously even in their intended function, many of them will stop working in just a few days. That's true for a lot of flashlight batteries for example. Many other batteries will last longer than that, because they are well suited to their purpose. They've been particularly designed. Nonetheless, most of them last a month to a year.<br />
</li><li> So if you think about, say, a watch battery, it does pretty well if it lasts for a year. Maybe an exceptional one will last for a year and a half or two years. The question is how to get to 100 years of lifetime. Now we know, of course, that various kinds of engineers and other chemists, other analyzers have worked hard to make batteries. And indeed the batteries that we have are, are miraculous. The man made batteries.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>--<br />
<strong>Energy: Battery Lifetime? (slide 26)</strong><br />
<ul><li> Still, compared to what we see in living systems, man made batteries don't amount to much. If we look at these pictures, on the left. We see this child. Right there, watching the fish. Right there. Both are highly electric. Both have very reliable (?) systems.<br />
</li><li> We're expecting the electricity in this child, to last as long as that child lives. And we hope that's a 100 years. We're expecting the electricity in this fish to last as long as that fish lives. I don't know how long that would be, but maybe it would be several years. If we look on the right, we see, a boy who is younger. A man who is older. The batteries in each of these systems are continuing to operate. And so as these two people share cereal at breakfast, the younger one seems to like the cereal on the right better than the cereal on the left.<br />
</li><li> We say hey, batteries in people last a hundred years. And it's wonderful that they do. So I'm gonna ask you to use your imagination, as next time you see somebody, and that is when you look at them, of course you'll see the normal person, but in your imagination I want you to picture billions of sodium potassium pumps. Billions of them scattered throughout all the electrically active systems in that person in their heart, in their brains, in their nervous system. They're all over.<br />
</li><li> And then I want you to picture the potassium leaking out of all of the electrically active cells, so that there are actually a whole bunch of voltages that are present, throughout that whole entire person. Now of course you can't see those voltages, but if you could, oh, they'd light up, from the top to the bottom, left to the right.<br />
</li><li> These are very electrically intense and distributed and reliable systems that are present. Thank you for your attention, we'll move onto the next segment.</p>
</li></ul>
