<p>Greetings, I'm Roger Coke Barr the instructor for bio electricity. Iâ€™ve had to take off my jacket today, because this weeks topic is about laying track. We've gotta get outside and do some hard work. Or in the bioelectric sense, what we have to do is to stop talking about individual patches of membrane, start talking about how currents flow from one place to the next. In the bioelectric sense this is like the track that the train runs on. It controls what happens next and next and next and next after that and what the whole entire sequence of events is from your brain all the way down to the tip of your toe, let's get started.</p>
