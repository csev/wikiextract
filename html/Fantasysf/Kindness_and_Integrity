					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Coursera is an international community, with different cultures and different lenses about what is rude and what isn't. </p>
<p>Even within one's own culture, the pure text tone of the internet makes it easy to misunderstand.   Coupled with the fact that all writers have egos, which they are putting on the line, this course affords huge potential for misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Please pay attention to what is written.   Look closely at the message, not the tone you imagine attached to it.<br />
Please pay attention to what you write.  An insult, real or perceived, to the other person may end up in your work being dismissed out of hand.</p>
