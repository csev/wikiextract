<p><b>56kb modem:</b> A modem with a transfer speed of 56,000 bits per second. These were in demand in the 1990s. Their popularity waned when DSL and cable systems offered much higher speeds to consumers.</p>
<p><b>Advanced Network and Services, Inc.:</b> This non-profit organization was established in 1990 and was instrumental in creating the internet. According to the ANS website, it "developed the first secure communications gateway for the Internet." (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.advanced.org/pages/p3/our_history.php">http://www.advanced.org/pages/p3/our_history.php</a>) In 1995, AOL bought out the company, although it continued to operate as a philanthropic organization until 2008.</p>
<p><b>Algorithm:</b>A clear and concise set of rules or steps to solve a particular problem.</p>
<p><b>ALOHAnet:</b> A revolution in wireless packet-data technology, the Alohanet began operations in June of 1971. Alohanet used ultra-high frequencies to connect users in several Hawaiian Islands with a main computer at the University of Hawaii. The Alohanet used a shared medium, which allowed its users to communicate at random all on the same frequency. They used an "acknowledgement/transmission" method to prevent data packets from crashing.  The Alohanet inspired Robert Metcalf and others to create the later Ethernet, which is still in use today and forms the basis for shared communication across networks.

<p><b>Baker, Mitchell:</b> As an employee of Netscape in 1994, Baker oversaw the legal issues concerning Netscape's intellectual properties. Under the banner of Netscape, the young lawyer wrote the first legal public license for the original Mozilla project. In 1999, Baker became the "chief lizard wrangler," an affectionate term for general manager, of the Mozilla project. Although AOL, the parent of Netscape, fired her from this position in 2001, she continued as its manager on a voluntary basis. In July of 2003, Baker became the president of the newly formed Mozilla Foundation, shortly after AOL disbanded its Netscape division and curtailed its support for Mozilla. She has continued in various capacities and is currently the executive chair of the Mozilla Foundation. In 2005, Time Magazine included her in its list of top 100 Scientists and Thinkers.

<p><b>Berners-Lee, Tim:</b> While working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Tim Berners-Lee wrote the code for the first web client and web server. He also created specifications for URLs, HTTP and HTML. In 1990, the Oxford graduate conceived the World Wide Web and eventually became the director of the World Wide Web Consortium. He is a proponent of an open internet and has won many prestigious awards for his efforts to keep the web free and available for everyone to use. The author of "Weaving the Web," a book that tells the history of his efforts to create the world wide web, Berners-Lee was among those honored with the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. This prize is awarded to those persons who benefit humanity with their groundbreaking innovations.

<p><b>Bezos, Jeff:</b> A pioneer of internet commerce, Bezos founded Amazon, the internet retailer, in July of 1995. Within a couple of months, the site was drawing an estimated $20,000 per week in sales, propelling the company to a success that even Bezos had not envisioned. The company soon expanded from books, its core product, to cds, videos, clothes, electronics and much more. Amazon entered the public trading arena in 1997 and within two years, outpaced all of its competitors through a series of retail partnerships. Amazon continued to innovate, releasing its popular Kindle digital reader in 2007. By 2011, Amazon sales topped 17 billion dollars and in 2013, Bezos ventured into another media, purchasing the <i>Washington Post</i> for $250 million dollars.

<p><b>Bit:</b> A bit, or a binary digit, is the smallest unit of storage that today's computers use. It either represents a 0 or a 1, which gives a "true" or "false" command that allows a computer to process data.</p>
<p><b>Bitnet:</b> In its heyday, Bitnet, which predated TCP/IP technology, connected as many as 500 educational institutions and 3,000 nodes within those institutions. Bitnet first connected CUNY (City University of New York) and Yale. The network then expanded to universities and other organizations that agreed to lease a phone line connected to a Bitnet node, buy modems, and offer other institutions the chance to connect to their site without extra cost. Bitnet provided a "store and forward" service, which meant that each message moved in its entirety from one node to another, until it reached its destination. This differs from the modern "packet" method, which breaks up messages into small bites. Because of the limitations of a store and forward system, Bitnet waned in popularity in the 1990s.

<p><b>Bletchley Park:</b> A small village outside London in Buckinghamshire, Bletchley Park once housed the most illustrious mathematicians and scientists in the world. Determined to discover the secret of Germany's seemingly unbreakable codes and ciphers, the GC&amp;CS (Government Code and Cypher School) set up shop in this rural area in order to work in secret and in relative safety from London's nightly blitzes. The most important achievement of the group's many achievements, at least concerning the war effort, was in cracking the Enigma cipher system. The work done at Bletchley Park also paved the way for the modern computer age.

<p><b>Bomba:</b> A machine used by Poland during the late 1930s and early 40s to crack the Nazi's Enigma cipher system. The machine replaced one hundred human computers in decrypting code. In 1939, Poles collaborated with British and French intelligence and provided aid in helping the British to design their own "Bombe" machine at Bletchley Park. With the new machine, the Enigma code was eventually decrypted.

<p><b>Bombe:</b> An electro-mechanical device used to decrypt Nazi ciphers during World War 2. Alan Turing based his Bombe machine on information provided by the Polish government, whose scientists invented the Bomba, used to decipher the earlier versions of the Enigma system. Gordon Welchman added refinements to the Bombe to enhance its capabilities, and he and Turing perfected the design. Bletchley Park took possession of the first Bombe machines, built by the British Tabulating Machine Company, in March of 1940.

<p><b>Byte:</b> This term has now come to mean a collection of eight bits, although at its inception, the number of bits varied. </p>
<p><b>C++:</b> A computer language standardized by the ISO, C++ ranks as one of the fastest languages when optimized by a skilled programmer. Although less intuitive than some of the others, it offers flexibility and a clean, succinct program.

<p><b>Cailliau, Robert:</b> A graduate of Ghent University in Belgium, Cailliau is known for producing the first web browser designed for the Apple Macintosh. Along with Tim Berners-Lee, Cailliau developed the hypertext system that facilitated the access of research documents. The pair also developed the World Wide Web. Cailliau played a significant role in the inception of the International WWW Conference Committee, as well as a role in transferring web development from CERN to the W3 consortium. Although now retired from CERN, he remains active in promoting education and politics, including a political movement called, "Newropeans."

<p><b>CERN:</b> CERN is an acronym for Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, or the European Council for Nuclear Research. Founded in 1954 along the French/Swiss border, its mission was to bring together physicists from all over the world to promote cooperative nuclear research for the benefit of all. Cern researchers created vast amounts of data that needed to be stored. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British physicist working at CERN, realized that the facility needed a readily available, easily stored database that could be accessed by all members. He conceived the idea for the World Wide Web. After Robert Cailliau, a Belgian engineer, signed on to the project, the duo created the first website, which gave information on their project. (For a view of the first website, see: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a>.) In 1993, CERN did something that revolutionized the internet and made it what it is today. They gave away the source code for anyone, anywhere, to utilize.

<p><b>Ciphertext:</b> Encrypted plain text,  ciphertext is unreadable without the corresponding cipher to decode it. In order to encode plain text into ciphertext, the cryptographer uses a specific algorithm, or cipher. Some of the more famous ciphertexts include the Babington Plot ciphers and the Zodiac Killer ciphers. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext</a>)</p>
<p><b>Colossus:</b> The first programmable electronic and digital computer, Colossus 1 was first set up in Bletchley Park in February of 1944. An upgraded version of Colossus came on line in June of the same year, just before D-Day. Colossus cracked the Lorenz cipher used in high-level German communications during World War 2. Designed by Tommy Flowers, an engineer with the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, Colossus was used to determine the key settings needed to decrypt Nazi teleprinter messages. It used a paper tape with sprocket holes that moved through the system at 27.3 mph during regular operation. Once switched on, the machine was never powered down unless it malfunctioned, in order to prevent failures that mainly occurred during initial power up. Although the original Colossus machines were destroyed in order to preserve secrecy, a replica was created and placed in the Bletchley Park museum in 2007.

<p><b>Computer Protocol: </b>See <i>Protocol.</i></p>
<p><b>CPU:</b> Acronym for <i>Central Processing Unit</i>, a CPU powers the computer's calculations and provides the brain power for all applications and tasks. The CPU consists of a chip, called a microprocessor, or in large computers, it may contain one or more circuit boards. The CPU normally contains an ALU, or arithmetic logic unit, and a CU, or control unit, which processes instructions and decoding tasks.

<p><b>Cryptographic Hash:</b> A function that transforms a message into a string of characters called a hash value or message digest (also known as a digital fingerprint, hash sum or checksum). While it is extremely easy to create a hash value for any message, it is nearly impossible to go backwards and recreate a message using the hash.

<p><b>Cryptography:</b> The science of encrypting and decrypting any form of ciphers and codes, cryptography has been employed since ancient times. The first known cryptographs date back as far as 1900 BC Egypt. Modern cryptography and cryptanalysis burgeoned after the start of the Second World War. One of the most famous examples of such efforts occurred at Bletchley Park in England. The Computer Age has spurred greater need for cryptography, in order to protect data on the internet.  (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History</a><em>of</em>cryptography)</p>
<p><b>Decryption:</b> A deciphered or decoded message that was previously encrypted using a cipher. (See Cryptography.)</p>
<p><b>Diffie, Whitfield:</b> A current visiting professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, Ralph Merkle co-invented public key encryption, along with Whit Diffie and Ralph Merkle. Although a computer scientist working for the British intelligence agency had developed the method a couple of years earlier, it was labeled top secret and unpublished until the 90s. Diffie, Hellman and Merkle's work, therefore, was the first to receive recognition. In 1976, while all three were working at Stanford, the men published their work, over strong opposition by the NSA. The Diffie-Hellman public key exchange method allowed people with no knowledge of each other to share keys securely over an insecure channel, such as the internet. Although the method was called Diffie-Hellman key exchange, in 2002, Hellman suggested a change to Diffie-Hellman-Merkle, to recognize Merkle's important contribution.

<p><b>Digest:</b> A digest, or message digest, is a fixed-length series of characters that represent a message of any length. It is created using a cryptographic hash function as a safe and secure way to encrypt data sent over the internet. A few of the more popular algorithms used to create message digests include SHA and MD5.

<p><b>Digital Certificate:</b> A digital certificate provides an authentication of identity. It is used in similar fashion to a driver's license, to assure that you are dealing with the entity that you believe is displayed on the other side of the computer screen. Digital certificates are granted to websites that first provide credentials to the grantors, such as Verisign. If the proofs are genuine, the grantor gives its stamp of approval to the website. When a site receives a digital certificate from Verisign or one of the other trusted grantors, you may be certain that you connect to your desired target website, rather than a clone.

<p><b>Digital Signature:</b> When a digital signature is attached to a document, it assures the recipient that the document has not been altered during transit between the sender's and the recipient's computers. A digital signature uses a DSA, or <i>Digital Signature Algorithm</i>, which creates the signature using the private and public keys. Only the sender should know the private key, and therefore, only the sender may create the digital signature. The public key, on the other hand, is used by everyone who deals with the sender. While it cannot be used to create the digital signature, it is useful in checking a signature's authenticity. A digital signature provides an extra level of security over an ordinary MAC (message authentication code).

<p><b>Domain Name:</b> A domain name affords humans an easily remembered substitute for a string of numbers that identifies a specific internet address. Domain names occur on several levels. Top level domains include .com, .net, .org and others, as well as country-specific domains such as .uk, .us, and .de. The secondary domain levels include specific names for people, organizations or companies, such as amazon or ebay, and lower still are the domains within those companies or organizations.

<p><b>Eich, Brendan:</b> Brendan Eich, along with Mitchell Baker and others, co-founded Mozilla. He is currently the CTO of the organization and is known for his efforts to help create the web that we have today. One of his most famous inventions is Javascript, a programming language that enables users to add functions to a browser. It is useful in the creation of applications and games. Eich made significant contributions to web standardization and is still active in creating OpenSource advancements for end users. He is also involved in developing a safer, more secure environment that protects consumers from spam and malware.

<p><b>Encryption:</b> A message that was encrypted or encoded using a cipher. (See Cryptography.)</p>
<p><b>ENIAC:</b> An acronym for <i>Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer</i>, ENIAC was the first electronic computer designed for general purpose computations. It came into operation in February of 1946 at the <i>Moore School of Electronic Engineering</i> (now called the <i>School of Engineering and Applied Science</i>, at the University of Pennsylvania). ENIAC was rapidly hailed as revolutionary, since it completed computations in minutes that heretofore took a team of mathematicians many months to compute. It also tackled equations that were previously believed too difficult to solve. The University of Pennsylvania still displays a few artifacts from the original machine.

<p><b>Enigma:</b> A machine used by the Nazis in World War 2 to encrypt and decrypt messages, the Enigma was first patented in 1919. All branches of the German military adopted it, with the Navy leading the way in 1926. German police, post offices, and other entities also depended upon the machine to secure any sensitive information. Between 1926 and 1945, several improvements in the design helped to thwart British and French intelligence who attempted to crack its code. Eventually, Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park, England, deciphered the most sophisticated Enigma encoder using the Bombe, a machine based on the Polish Bomba, which had decrypted messages from earlier versions of the Enigma machine. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/how-enigma-works.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/how-enigma-works.html</a>)</p>
<p><b>Ethernet:</b> As it was first conceived, the Ethernet provided a way to connect many different computers to a central source within a particular network, each acting as a broadcasting medium. The idea stemmed from the premise that sharing and broadcasting a data stream could be accomplished through the use of many <i>AUIs</i>, or Attachment Unit Interfaces, all linking to a main cable, with each AUI connecting to a particular computer or device. Robert Metcalf first conceived this premise by studying the ALOHAnet model, developed at the University of Hawaii. He coined the term "Ethernet" after the discarded 19th century belief in a pervasive, passive "aether" that facilitated the passage of light. Xerox adopted Metcalf's ideas and developed the Ethernet between 1973-74. In 1975, the company filed a patent for the product, listing Metcalf and others as its inventors. Today, the Ethernet has evolved from the first coaxial cables; it uses fiber optics to send data packets and fully integrates the system into a computer's motherboard, eliminating the need for Ethernet network cards. It has also developed the "EtherSwitch," which reduces the time needed to send packets through the system.  (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet</a>)</p>
<p><b>Fiber Optics:</b> Long strands of thin, hair-like glass are bundled together to form fiber optic cable. These cables carry digital information across short or vast distances. Depending upon whether it is a single-mode fiber, with a core of about 9 microns in diameter, or a multi-mode fiber, with a 62.5-micron diameter, the cable may contain hundreds or even thousands of these glass strands.

<p><b>Firefox:</b> A web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. Originally named Phoenix, Firefox began in 2002 as an OpenSource, web-browsing alternative to Internet Explorer. It included several enhancements not found in its large competitor, but did not gain popularity until 2004, when Firefox 1.0 was released to the public. More than a million consumers downloaded the browser in 1994 alone. By 2008, Firefox had become the browser of choice for twenty percent of internet users and continues to grow in popularity.

<p><b>Flowers, Tommy:</b> An electrical engineer with a degree from the University of London, Flowers began working for the GPO (General Post Office) in 1926 and was transferred to GPO's Dollis Hill research facility in 1930.  When Alan Turing, who headed a team of code breakers at Bletchley Park, contacted the GPO to ask for help in building a decoder for the Bombe machine, Tommy Flowers came on board at Bletchley Park to help with the effort. Flowers first conceived the Colossus in 1943, an electronic computer that used thermionic valves, or vacuum tubes, and one paper tape rather than two. Despite some opposition to his design, Flowers gained the full support of both his director, W.G. Radley, as well as Alan Turing. The Mark 1 Colossus machine began operations at Dollis Hill in November 1943 and was moved to Bletchley Park in early 1944. The Mark 2 version of Colossus came online in June of 1944, just days before the D-Day invasion. The machine proved valuable to that effort.

<p><b>Gateway or Network Gateway:</b> A network gateway is an entry system that acts as a "door" or connection point for two or more different networks with different protocols. A typical example of a network gateway would be a broadband router that connects different home computer devices to a modem. Many gateways include firewall systems within their architecture. You sometimes see the term "default gateway" used to describe the gateway normally used to connect devices, though there may be other network gateways that act as supplements or backups.

<p><b>GC&amp;CS:</b> An acronym for the Government Code and Cypher School, this British institution operated out of Bletchley Park during World War 2 and put governmental resources into the hands of cryptographers. The school's resources and manpower were critical to the decryption success of the Bletchley Park team, who helped to thwart German intelligence and movements, and thereby shorten the war.

<p><b>Geheimschreiber:</b> German word meaning, "secret writer," it includes any device used for enciphering or deciphering a message. The German machine, "Enigma," was one famous example of a geheimschreiber.</p>
<p><b>Gigabyte:</b> 1024 megabytes of data storage space or 1000 megabytes of computer transfer speed. A gigabyte is also 8 gigabits. It is abbreviated with a capital "B" (gB) to distinguish the byte from a bit.</p>
<p><b>Gopher:</b> Developed by the University of Minnesota in 1991, Gopher protocols allow computer users to search and retrieve documents stored and shared on any computer. An early competitor to Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web's HTTP protocol, the Gopher protocol was once far more popular. Its simplicity attracted users, and early web browsers such as Mosaic supported the gopher protocols. However, Gopher's lack of flexibility and text-only capability allowed HTTP to eclipse it by the mid-nineties. One of HTTP's main advantages was that it supported web graphics. This allowed for games and visually stimulating applications. One of the main reasons for HTTPs popularity, however, was the fact that Tim Berners-Lee gave away his source code, while the University of Minnesota considered a fee schedule for licensing their gopher product. Some people, however, still believe that gopher has advantages over HTTP. A small but dedicated segment of users has kept this technology from the dustbin of obsolescence.

<p><b>Hardin, Joseph:</b> A sociologist who met Larry Smarr while studying nuclear arms control, Hardin accepted a position as head of software development in Smarr's new group, the NCSA (see separate entry). Their shared vision was to connect the dots between supercomputers in major institutions with desktop computers used in homes and small businesses. Toward this end, the pair developed and promoted Telnet, which afforded remote access to powerful computers, and Collage, which allowed multiple people in remote locations to edit the same documents. Hardin also promoted Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina's browser, Mosaic, which was based on the work of Tim Berners-Lee and associates. Once Mosaic launched, Hardin spent much of his time demonstrating and advertising its capabilities. Unlike previous browsers that were geared toward academia, Mosaic meshed academic, commercial and casual browser usage. With this difference, it leaped ahead of its competitors, and Joseph Hardin established himself as a pioneer in the web's proliferation.(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://berniers.net/CS4Class/mosaic.html">http://berniers.net/CS4Class/mosaic.html</a>)</p>
<p><b>Hash Function:</b> See Cryptographic Hash. </p>
<p><b>Hashtag:</b> When a word or phrase is preceded by a hash mark (#) on social networking sites such as Twitter, it identifies a searchable keyword or topic. For example, the hash tag #grocerycoupons might draw consumers looking for grocery bargains. While hashtags were used in IRC communications long before Twitter came into being, Twitter turned the hashtag into the phenomenon it is today. The first hashtag on Twitter was tweeted by Chris Messina, a computer consultant, who used the tag as a way to organize information on the site. Since that first tweet, millions of hashtags are used daily.

<p><b>Hellman, Martin:</b> A current professor emeritus at Stanford University, Martin Hellman co-invented public key encryption, along with Whit Diffie and Ralph Merkle. Although a computer scientist working for the British intelligence agency had developed the method a couple of years earlier, it was labeled top secret and unpublished until the 90s. Diffie, Hellman and Merkle's work, therefore, was the first to receive recognition. In 1976, the men published their work, over strong opposition by the NSA. The Diffie-Hellman public key exchange method allowed people with no knowledge of each other to share keys securely over an insecure channel, such as the internet. Although the method was called Diffie-Hellman key exchange, in 2002, Hellman suggested a change to Diffie-Hellman-Merkle, to recognize Merkle's important contribution.

<p><b>Hop:</b> A hop occurs when a piece of data, or packet, passes from one router or gateway to another on the path between its originating computer and its destination. Each separate pass-through from one router to the next forms a separate hop. There is a limit to the number of hops each packet is allowed to take before the system discards it. This prevents data from perpetually looping through the system. Once a packet reaches its hop limit, it is tossed out and the originating computer is informed of the loss, so that it may resend a new copy of the packet.

<p><b>HTML:</b> The most popular computer language on the web, HTML provides the core for nearly all of the content you see on websites. It describes the structure that allows programmers to display content in a visually pleasing and informative way. There are several different versions of HTML. In the "relaxed" version, the HTML does not have to be precise. Some even allow a user to forget a closing tag without affecting the end product. XML, on the other hand, requires precise and careful coding. In 2012, the W3 placed the newest version, HTML5, on its <i>Candidate Recommendation</i> list. Since that time, its use has burgeoned. While HTML5 eliminates some of the functions of the earliest language and relies instead on cascading style sheets for the design of a web page, it adds features such as enhanced multimedia support.

<p><b>HTTP:</b> HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, has been in use on the web since 1990. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN, HTTP helped to solve some of the communication problems between clients and servers. From March 1996 to June of the same year, one web hosting company reported that the number of HTTP compliant browsers increased from 40 to 65 percent. People speculate as to the reason for HTTP's meteoric rise, even over some more popular (at the time) competitors such as the University of Minnesota's gopher. Many attribute this rise to the fact that Berners-Lee and CERN gave away the source code, which allowed free development and proliferation of the technology. Whether or not this act sealed its success, HTTP, and the fact that it remained non-proprietary, significantly influenced the World Wide Web that we know today. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html#sec1">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html#sec1</a>)</p>
<p><b>HTTPS:</b> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, or HTTPS, adds security to the HTTP. It is not a protocol, per se, but rather, a secure socket layer, or SSL, that is added to the HTTP protocol. (see HTTP.) This provides added security to standard HTTP communications and makes it possible to encrypt data, such as credit card information. HTTPS ensures that the identity of the destination website is confirmed, thereby preventing rerouting to a third party. In order to fully utilize the security of the HTTPS secure socket layer, the entire web page must be secured, rather than only a part of it. Whether or not the entire page is secure can be determined by the web address, which starts with "https" rather than "http." (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure</a>)</p>
<p><b>Hub:</b> A computer hub is the junction at which data from different devices meet. The hub acts as a central gathering station and sends packets forward to their destination or, in some cases, deletes them and informs the originating computer of the deletion, so that the originator may retransmit. </p>
<p><b>Hyperlink:</b> A hyperlink is a word, block of text, image or other element that when clicked, takes the reader to another web page or another part of the current page. Hypertext is text that includes hyperlinks to another location. A hyperlink must specify an <i>anchor</i>, or location within a document, that may open in a new window or may direct the user to that location from the same window. A hyperlink may also be bi-directional, which means that the destination text may contain a hyperlink that leads back to the original document. When the text in the link is blue, it signifies that the user has not clicked it during the current browser session. The link turns purple when visited.

<p><b>IBM:</b> A multi-billion dollar company, International Business Machines has engineered and manufactured new technology since 1911 (under the IBM banner since 1924). The company leads the world in the number of patents granted within a consecutive 20-year period, and IBM scientists have earned numerous Nobel prizes, Turing awards, and other medals in the science and technology fields. Technology designed and developed at IBM include: the IBM 704, the first "self-learning" computer, the FORTRAN computer language, the UPC coding system, and WATSON, an artificial intelligence program that appeared on the program, <i>Jeopardy!</i>, where it won the match against humans competitors. Although many believe that IBM missed out on the personal computer bonanza (and the company posted the largest loss in corporate American history in 1993, at a time when Apple and Microsoft enjoyed success), the company is still a leader in innovation. It was named the second most respected company in the world, according to Barron's, and was voted the number one green company by Newsweek magazine.

<p><b>IHTS:</b> This is an acronym for the course, <i>Internet History, Technology and Security</i>. You'll find it used frequently in the class forum and other course materials. IHTS is also the Twitter official hashtag for the course.</p>
<p><b>Internet:</b> Many people confuse the internet with the World Wide Web. While the internet facilitates the WWW, it operates independently and predates the web. The internet is a network comprising many different networks, all using protocols to communicate with each other. A computer that is connected to the internet may communicate with any other connected computer anywhere in the world by using these protocols, which function as languages of their own. As of 2011, nearly one-third of the planet's population connects to the rest of the world through the internet.

<p><b>Internetwork Layer:</b> This layer, also known as the Internet Protocol (IP) Layer or simply the Network Layer, delivers packets from one computer to another. All of the protocols in the other three layers of the TCP/IP architecture depend upon the IP layer to deliver data from one location to another. Every piece of data either coming in or going out of the device must flow through the IP layer. This layer routes messages through gateways, or routers, and identifies IP addresses. It takes in data, processes it and sends it on its way to its final destination. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs329e/slides6-ip-layer.pdf">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs329e/slides6-ip-layer.pdf</a>)</p>
<p><b>IP Address:</b> In the TCP/IP protocol that is standard on today's Internet, every device has its own unique internet address, which may be static or dynamic. Dynamic addresses are issued by the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and are only in use by a specific device for a limited time. A static address gives the user the ability to configure his or her own address and keep it, but this may cause difficulty if the person configuring the address is not thoroughly versed in TCP/IP architecture. IP addresses also come in two versions. The older, more common type is called IP version 4, or IPv4, which is employed by every computer currently connected to the internet. Under the IPv4 system, there are 4.3 billion possible unique addresses. This number seemed sufficient when the internet first spawned, but this is no longer the case. To solve this problem, newer devices also carry an IP version 6 unique address. Under this version, trillions of unique addresses may be assigned. Eventually, the IPv4 system in use today will become obsolete.

<p><b>ISDN:</b> The Integrated Services Digital Network, or ISDN, allows high-speed transmission of video, graphics and other media over normal communication relays. ISDN lines can carry much more information than is possible on a standard phone line, and so ISDN employs not only phone lines, but also CATV, telex and other networks. Users may access these communication relays through the ISDN interface. The CCITT (International Consultative Committee on Telecommunications and Telegraphy) recommends and attempts to maintain uniform standards for ISDN lines, although some variants still exist internationally.

<p><b>Jacobson, Van:</b> An Internet Hall of Fame inductee, Van Jacobson's "slow-start" algorithm helped to encourage the proliferation of the Internet by increasing the speed at which information moved through the system. It drastically reduced the number of bottlenecks and eased congestion that had previously limited the Internet's traffic flow. He helped the Internet to endure its first major explosion in traffic during 1988-89, and thereby increased its popularity and survivability. In addition to this achievement, Jacobson has authored and co-authored dozens of design enhancements, such as traceroute, tcpdump and pathchar. Jacobson's work helped to lay the foundation for later applications such as VoIP.

<p><b>Java:</b> A programming language approximately two decades old, Java is one of the most enduring and prolific icons in the technology age. Based on the philosophy of <i>WORA</i> (write once, run anywhere), Java programs can run without major reprogramming on any JVM (Java virtual machine), no matter what the computer architecture. The foundation for many platforms and thousands of applications, games and multimedia endeavors, Java allows software to run smoothly and solves problems for server, client and embedded programmers. First created in 1991 by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton and Mike Sheridan, Java has had a checkered history with some spectacular successes and a few serious blunders, but it is still one of the most popular languages. It is also one of the first that new programmers learn. Some of its advantages include the ability to handle hundreds of threads without crashing. This workhorse attracts larger users such as major corporations or sites with multiple games, such as <i>Pogo.com</i>. The ability to handle multiple tasks across platforms helps to keep Java viable in a changing world. Although recent security issues have marred its reputation, Java continues to support new technology, such as blue-ray. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-2013/131021-12-keys-to-java-s-enduring-dominance.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-2013/131021-12-keys-to-java-s-enduring-dominance.html</a>)</p>
<p><b>Javascript:</b> A programming language that allows for robust scripting of web pages, Javascript is also used in non-web applications such as pdfs. Invented by Brenden Eich during his employment with Netscape, Javascript provides support for object-oriented and several other programming styles. Drawing design ideas from the programming languages "Self" and "Scheme," Eich aimed to create a language that enabled the user to interact with the client-side script, control the browser and alter the content of displayed documents. Javascript garnered huge success for its web page capabilities in the mid and late 90s. That success continued through the 21st century and is still widespread today. The CommonJS Project's was founded in January 2009. Its goal is to create a standard library for the development of JavaScript beyond its web browser core capabilities. As of 2013, however, Javascript's dominant usage remains in its web browser scripting.

<p><b>Kunz, Paul:</b> Particle physicist who initiated the startup of the first web server in America, or for that matter, anywhere outside of Europe, Paul Kunz met with Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It was then that he became aware of developments in the deployment of a World Wide Web. Upon his return to Stanford University, he disclosed that information to staff members. By December of 1991, Paul initiated the installation and startup of Stanford's own web server, with the help of Louise Addis and Terry Hung. In addition, Paul developed software such as HippoDraw. A proponent of a free web, Paul was also instrumental in open source implementations such as GNUstep for NeXTstep, as well as objcX.

<p><b>Kilobyte:</b> A kilobyte (kB) equals 1024 bytes of data storage space or 1000 bytes of computer transfer speed. A kilobyte is also 8 kilobits. It is abbreviated with a capital "B" to distinguish the byte from a bit.</p>
<p><b>LAN:</b> A LAN, or local area network, connects computers within a small, defined area, such as an office building, school or home. The difference between a LAN and a WAN (wide-area network) lies in its scope, which is much more limited than a WAN. Ethernet is a popular method of connecting components within the LAN. The Ethernet uses structured cabling between each computer station. Where cabling is not practical, the WiFi, or wireless radio waves, may connect such components. In the past, other technologies such as ARCNET, which used coaxial cables, were popular, but these proved too limiting. The current WiFi and Ethernet systems connect virtually all computers in the world.

<p><b>Layers:</b> The Internet Protocol Suite used to communicate over the internet employs a system of layers, each separate and distinct but interconnecting to seamlessly allow the transfer of information from one computer to another.  The TCP/IP model, which dominates internet traffic, uses four layers: the link layer (also called the network access layer), the internet or internetwork layer, the transport layer and the application layer.  The older, OSI model, consisted of a seven layer model. In the OSI structure, the link layer was broken into two parts and the application layer broken into three, thereby making a seven-layer structure, rather than four. For more information, see the entries under individual layers of the TCP/IP model. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~icucart/networking_basics/4LayersofTCPIPModel.html">http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~icucart/networking_basics/4LayersofTCPIPModel.html</a>)</p>
<p><b>Link Layer:</b> In the TCP/IP architecture, the link layer is comprised of several components. One of these is the ARP, or address resolution protocol. When it receives an IP destination address, it sends a request for the Ethernet address and handles the reply. It also caches the information for a limited time, since it is likely that the same address will be used for additional packets within a certain time frame. Another component of the link layer is the RARP, or reverse address resolution protocol. One more component includes the kernel/device drivers that configure the interface and set the host's broadcast address.

<p><b>Linux:</b> Linux is one of the best known open source, free computer operating systems.  It was first made available to the public in 1991 by its creator, Linus Torvalds. Linux's design was based upon Richard Stallman's GNU operating system, first released in 1983. Because of this, the Free Software Foundation uses the proper name <i>GNU/Linux</i> when it refers to the system that most people simply call "Linux."  Linux operates across more computer platforms than any other open source system. Most of the world's fastest computers employ the Linux operating system. Its performance surpasses many of the proprietary and expensive systems. Due to Linux's open source status, anyone under the GNU General Public License may use, modify and enhance and then publish their own code based upon the operating system. Partly due to this flexibility, Linux-based programs enjoy continued popularity.

<p><b>Macintosh:</b> The Apple Macintosh, introduced in January of 1984, was the first mass-marketed personal computer to use a mouse. It also included the first commercially successful launch of the GUI, or graphical user interface, in a personal desktop computer. Apple also came out with the Macintosh portable in late 1989, they replaced this model in early 1991 with the Power Book. The Macintosh experienced a revival with the entry of the iMac in 1998, and Mac spinoffs continue to be sold today.

<p><b>Mainframes:</b> Mainframe computers, large and bulky units once used by most large corporations and governments, process huge amounts of data for tasks such as the census, social security records and governmental statistics. Also known as "big irons," the term "mainframe" derived from the bulky cabinet that housed the CPUs (central processing units.) One of a mainframe's central characteristics was its many redundant backups, which allowed for both security and increased reliability. Mainframes began to fall out of favor in the 1990s as personal computers became more powerful and as new supercomputers came on line. For the most part, mainframes have been relegated to obsolescence. The last NASA mainframe went offline in 2009.

<p><b>Media Access Control Address (MAC address):</b> A MAC address, or media access control address, identifies one or more network adaptors on any computer system. It is written as six pairs of characters; colons separate the pairs. In order for your router to connect to the internet, the router must know the MAC address of each network adaptor. By using the command, "getmac" in the command prompt line of a windows machine, you may learn your MAC address. There are many other ways to retrieve the MAC address; for more options as well as a thorough explanation of media access control addressing, please click on the link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-MAC-Address-of-Your-Computer">http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-MAC-Address-of-Your-Computer</a></p>
<p><b>Megabyte:</b> 1024 kilobytes of data storage capacity or 1000 kilobytes of computer transfer speed. A megabyte is also 8 megabits. It is abbreviated with a capital "B" to distinguish the byte from a bit.</p>
<p><b>Merkle, Ralph:</b> A senior fellow at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, Merkle's contribution to public key encryption was not as well recognized as his colleagues' efforts, who lent their names to the Diffie-Hellman public key method. As part of the Stanford trio who pioneered public key cryptography, Merkle's part was vital. The trio published a method by which people unknown to each other could exchange information securely over the internet. After the Diffie-Hellman method gained popularity, e-commerce burgeoned. In 2002, Hellman suggested that the name be changed to the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle public key exchange method, to recognize Merkle's work. He, along with Diffie and Hellman, received awards for their breakthrough work. Also see entries for Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.

<p><b>Message Authentication Code (MAC authentication):</b>  The message authentication code used in cryptography provides security and assurance that the message the recipient receives is the one that the sender actually sent, without any subverted components. A MAC algorithm accepts a message of any length as well as a secret "key." The algorithm then creates a MAC, which is sometimes called a tag. With this MAC, the message recipient, provided they know the secret key, may ensure that the message has not been altered by a third party. MACs may be created in a number of ways, including through cryptographic hash functions. (See separate entry for Cryptographic Hash.)

<p><b>Merit Network:</b> The Merit Network, founded in 1966 by a group of Michigan educational institutions including Michigan State University, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, pioneered many advancements in establishing an internet network. Many of the protocols still used in the digital age were first conceived at Merit. A consortium led by Merit in 1987, which included the Michigan Strategic Fund and partners IBM and MCI, received a large grant from the National Science Foundation to redesign and oversee the NSFNET, the early internet system to promote education and research. This early system eventually inspired the expansion of the internet we have today.

<p><b>Michigan Terminal System:</b> The MTS was first put into operation at the University of Michigan in 1967. It was the first major effort by a university to offer a time-shared computer operating system. A group of eight universities spread throughout the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom accessed this system during its thirty-three years of operation, from 1967-99. Several popular programs were developed for the MTS, including MICRO Informational Management System, an early database management system, and MIDAS (Michigan Interactive Data Analysis System) a statistical analysis program. The University of Michigan's MTS service was fully operational until June 30, 1996, when it stopped serving its end users. Its MTS terminal remained in limited operation until May of 1997, when it shut down permanently. The MTS system, however, was still used by several other entities and some form of the MTS still survives today.

<p><b>Microsoft:</b> One of the most recognized names in computer software and operating systems, Microsoft started out in 1975 as a small start-up. In 1980, Microsoft partnered with IBM to design a new operating system called MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System). IBM launched its PC with MS-DOS the next year. Although MS-DOS proved successful, many people found it difficult to learn. Microsoft then released "Windows" (originally called, "Interface Manager") in 1985, and the company's success skyrocketed. Although it lagged behind some other companies in fueling the growth of the internet, Microsoft eventually designed its own Internet Explorer, which ultimately became the most popular web browser. The company has since produced other products, among them its popular "Office Suite." The Windows operating system continues to provide the company with substantial revenue, and Bill Gates remains one of the richest men in the world.

<p><b>Modem:</b> A modem, or "modulator-demodulator," affords computers the ability to transmit information over phone or cable lines. It converts digital data from a computer into analog data that a phone or cable line can recognize. This allows the analog line to carry the information to its destination. Modems may be internal, or inserted into the computer's expansion slot, or it may be external, attached to the computer with a cable. Many later modems include fax capability.

<p><b>Mosaic:</b> Designed by Marc Andreessen, Erik Bina and their team with support from Tim Berners-Lee, Mosaic was released by the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) in 1993. The web browser is credited with expediting the proliferation of the World Wide Web. Named for its versatility and ability to support various internet protocols, Mosaic was the first browser to combine images and text in the same window. The NCSA continued to update and support the browser until 1997 and as of 2013, one can still download it from that source. Some of the original creators of Mosaic went on to design Netscape, and many of Mosaic's features, such as the url bar, the GUI interface, and the back and forward buttons, are still seen today in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome.

<p><b>Mozilla:</b> The Mozilla project was founded in 1998 by a group that included Mitchell Baker and Brenden Eich (see separate entries). Its mission was to create an open source, free to the public browser that offered innovation and an enhanced browser experience. Toward this end, they released  Mozilla 1.0 in 2002. The Mozilla project established the Mozilla Foundation in 2003, a non-profit company created to promote a free and open source web community. The Foundation released Firefox 1.0 in 2004, and with it, Mozilla's popularity burgeoned. In the first year alone, they clocked over one million downloads of the browser. By 2008, they had carved out 20 percent of the browser market share. Firefox continues its success to this day, and new versions may be downloaded free of charge.

<p><b>National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA):</b> Located at the University of Illinois, the NCSA offers scientists and engineers its supercomputing services to gather and analyze project data, provide timely communications and computations, and create an integrated and collaborative environment with which to share knowledge. It was established through the efforts of Larry Smarr, who wrote the first successful unsolicited proposal to the NSF (National Science Foundation) for a grant to create a supercomputing center. The NCSA at Illinois became one of four (later, five) supercomputing facilities across the country. It began operations as the NSCA entity in 1986, although its first 24-processor supercomputer array, the Cray X-MP, came online in August of 1985. The NCSA offers a slide show of supercomputers throughout history on their website.

<p><b>National Physics Laboratory:</b> A United Kingdom based entity, the National Physics Laboratory provides the measurement standards for the entire country and leads the world in precise and accurate measurements. Much work in the computer field was accomplished at the NPL, including ACE, the first Automatic Computing Engine. The work on this machine was begun in 1946 and completed in 1958. At Ace's inception, Alan Turing was called upon to formulate the plans for its design and construction. Two decades after ACE was conceived, another important breakthrough in the computer field, packet switching, was developed at NPL. Donald Davies came up with the technique, which involves separating a message into tiny chunks of information and recombining it once it reaches its destination.

<p><b>National Science Foundation:</b> Congress established the National Science Foundation, or the NSF, in 1950. Its goal is to assist and fund research that promotes progress in the fields of science, national health, welfare, prosperity and national defense. The NSF has funded many projects which have ultimately led to the Information Age. In 1981, the NSF established the CSNET, which paved the way for the later internet. The next year, it developed the technology for speech recognition. In 1985, in response from a grant proposal by Larry Smarr from the University of Illinois, the NSF established Advanced Scientific Computing Centers (later known as the NCSA; see separate entry). Two years later, they built the framework for the internet. The NSF has provided the impetus for many other breakthroughs in the field, and continues to provide research grants that enhance computer technology.

<p><b>Netscape:</b> The Netscape browser, produced by the Mosaic Communications Corporation in the mid-90s, once dominated the browser market share. The first version, Mosaic, (later called Mosaic Netscape) was released in 1994. It came under fire from the NCSA for infringement. Some of the Netscape browser designers had originally worked on the NCSA's Mosaic version, before their employment at Netscape. To avoid costly litigation, Netscape changed its browser name to Netscape Navigator.  It also changed the company name to Netscape Communications Corporation. Version 2 of the browser added Netscape Mail, allowing for easy access emails. Until it faced serious challenges from Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape held over 90 percent of the browser market share. In the late 90s, some of the Netscape programmers formed the Mozilla project, to create an open source browser that would compete with Internet Explorer. After a series of minor setbacks, AOL took over Netscape and too quickly released Netscape 6.0, which had major bugs. Its flop, as well as later difficulties, prompted AOL to shut down its Netscape division in 2003. The Mozilla Project, however, thrived and eventually produced the Firefox web browser, which holds about 20 percent of the browser market share today (see separate entry).

<p><b>NeXT computers:</b> Developed by NeXT Inc, a firm that Steve Jobs headed after leaving Apple, the NeXT computer was considered by many to be the most advanced system of its kind during its era, from 1988-1990. Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau used a NeXT computer when they developed the first web server software. Informally called "the cube" (which later became the official name of an upgraded model) the machine sold in 1988 for $6500, but was phased out in 1990.

<p><b>Open Source:</b> Open Source defines software programs that are free to use, distribute, modify without any royalties or fees. Open source programs are non-proprietary, meaning that the original creator offers the program for free distribution, modification and use without discrimination against any group or entity. </p>
<p><b>Open Source Initiative:</b> The OSI is a California-based non-profit founded in 1998 by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens. It reviews and approves licenses for Open Source software, and also advocates, educates and advises others in the use and sharing of Open Source code. The OSI is a 501(c) corporation with tax-exempt status. Its mission is to represent the Open Source community and to act as stewards of the Open Source concept and definition.

<p><b>OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection):</b> The International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, offered the OSI model in 1977 as an attempt to standardize computer networking systems. The ISO brought together many different industry giants from around the world in order to establish uniformity within the computer networking community. Prior to the establishment of the OSI model, governments had their own systems, such as the ARPANET in the US and CYCLADES in France. Private industry, too, used their own protocols for networking. The OSI model offered a chance for everyone to use the same protocols, thereby making networking between systems less complicated and time consuming. The OSI model used seven layers, including the physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation and application layers. Eventually, the OSI was largely replaced by the TCP/IP protocol suite, which merges these processes into four layers.

<p><b>Packet:</b> In internet terminology, a <i>packet</i> is one small piece of a larger message, document, or program that is sent over the internet from source to destination. The packet does not need to travel with its entire message, but rather, may take its own individual journey through various network switches or routers. When it reaches its destination, it is recombined with its original message and delivered to the recipient as part of the whole message. A packet is sometimes called a <i>datagram.</i> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/packet">http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/packet</a>)</p>
<p><b>Packet Switching:</b> Packet switching was first conceived by two scientists working independently. Donald Davies of the National Physics Laboratory and Paul Baran at the Rand Corporation both designed packet switching technology, in which a document, message or any piece of data is broken down into small data blocks. Each block carries its own copy of the destination address. Unlike the original circuit switching technology, packet switching does not require a circuit to remain open and unavailable for other use when no activity is taking place. This occurs, for example, in telephone conversations, where one person speaks and the other person listens. Despite the fact that no activity is taking place on the listener's side, they are still taking up space on the circuit. With packet switching, this does not occur. Therefore, it utilizes the bandwidth much more efficiently and prevents bandwidth clogs from large amounts of data trying to pass through a single router. Every piece of data may move through different routers on their way to the destination computer, where the data is recombined. Donald Davies is credited with the name "packet switching," and the technology is still in use today. (See "Packet" under separate entry.) (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching</a>)</p>
<p><b>Platforms:</b> Computer platforms provide the components which allow software to run. They include the hardware and operating system. Many older software programs run on only one platform. Newer software may run across multiple platforms, and are called, "cross-platform" or "multi-platform" programs. One example of a platform would be an Apple computer and its corresponding Mac operating system.</p>
<p><b>Ports:</b> A "port," in computer terminology, may be either a virtual port, through which data travels through the network, or a physical port, through which a cable may connect to a router, modem, or other device to a computer. Examples of physical ports include a USB port or an Ethernet port. A virtual port, on the other hand, uses Transport Layer protocols to connect to a wider network, such as the World Wide Web. An individual "port number" is identified for each particular address. There are approximately 250 virtual ports that are reserved for certain applications. Port 80, for example, is known as the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) port. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known</a><em>ports#Well-known</em>ports) </p>
<p><b>Private Key Encryption: </b>In a single key encryption system, one key, the private key, is used to both encrypt and decrypt a message. This method is useful when a small group of trusted friends are sending and receiving messages. The paramount concern is that the private key remain private. With a single key system, the more entities that possess the private key, the less likely that it will remain out of the hands of people outside of the trusted circle. Additionally, the more people in the circle, the harder it is to securely relay the private key to them. Therefore, single key encryption methods cannot be used for e-commerce. For such enterprises, a public key encryption method allows a wide network that may include virtually everyone on the planet. (See Public Key) (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.kioskea.net/contents/130-private-key-or-secret-key-cryptography">http://en.kioskea.net/contents/130-private-key-or-secret-key-cryptography</a>)</p>
<p><b>Proprietary Software: </b>Also known as closed source software, proprietary software includes all programs in which the purchaser, or licensee, is restricted by the licensor from sharing, modifying, or otherwise using the software in a manner not specifically spelled out in the licensee agreement. In most cases, the licensee has no access to the source code of the software program. This term is sometimes confused with commercial software, which may or may not be proprietary software.  (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software</a>)</p>
<p><b>Protocol: </b>Protocols are simply a set of rules that every computer uses in order to function and communicate with other computers. Network protocols provide the basic formatting rules to communicate between networks and to formulate how packets should move through the systems. Internet protocols determine how a LAN, or local area network, will communicate with the WAN, or wide area network (see separate entries). Some of the more well-known protocols include HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which allows web browsers to interact with each other. Operating systems, such as Linux or Microsoft Windows, integrate network protocols into their systems. Software designers, as well, conform to protocols that allow their programs to connect and properly interact with the computer or the internet.

<p><b>Public Key Encryption: </b>In an asymmetric encryption system, two keys are used. The public key is freely dispersed, and is used to both encrypt plain text as well as to verify the validity of a message signature, or digital signature. The public key allows a user to verify that the message they received is from a known and verified source. It also allows them to send their plain text data over the internet without fear of interception and compromise. This key is mathematically paired with the private key through a calculation that involves prime numbers. While it is easy to generate the mathematical equation, it is virtually impossible to solve it without the private key, which deciphers the encrypted message. Public Key Encryption is the method used in e-commerce, via a secure socket layer (see Secure Socket Layer).

<p><b>Rot13:</b> Rot13 (or rot-13) is an example of a Caesar cipher, named for the ancient Roman ruler who is often credited with its invention. The cipher is very simple and merely replaces each letter with another letter 13 places behind it in the alphabet. For example, an "a" would be coded as an "n," while an "s" would translate as an "f." (For letters nearer the end of the alphabet, one must wrap around to the beginning of it to find its cipher twin.) As a cipher, it provides no security, but many computer nerds and forum patrons use rot13 as a way to get around forum rules, post offensive or otherwise banned material, and create simple games.

<p><b>Router: </b>A router is a piece of physical equipment that can connect two or more devices through a LAN, or local area network. It may also connect computers within a home or business to the WAN, or wide area network, such as the internet. In other words, it sends any data packets that it receives and sends them forward to their destinations. Each packet sent carries a copy of its destination address. A router reads this address and sends the packet further along its way. Routers are also called gateway devices. They may be wired or wireless; a good example would be your wireless modem. A typical router is a standard IP, or Internet Protocol router. This is most common for use in homes and small businesses.

<p><b>Search engine: </b>A search engine searches any database, from a small college library to the entire World Wide Web, to retrieve information on demand. It uses automatic web crawlers, also known as spiders, to examine websites and check out all of the links on each page. It then determines the type of information offered and its relevance for any given search. The search engine stores information about these web pages and categorizes the information. When a user types a query, it checks its database for the list of pages that match the query. Computer search engines became popular in the early 1990s. Among the most popular are Google, Bing and Yahoo Search.

<p><b>Secure Socket Layer: </b>A secure socket layer, or SSL, provides the user an easy way to transmit and receive sensitive data over the internet. Any organization may apply for an SSL certificate through one of the trusted entities that provide this service, such as GlobalSign or VeriSign. Once verified, the organization receives a certificate that they can install on their web page. This allows them to establish a secure connection through Port 443, the secure socket port, rather than the insecure HTTP port 80. Port 443 is identified by the "lock" sign as well as the "HTTPS" in the web address.  Users who see the lock and the "https" address know that their credit card information or other data is secure.

<p><b>Serf, Vint:</b> Vinton Serf, one of the original "fathers" of the internet, was instrumental in the development of internet protocols, including the TCP/IP protocol suite. He also developed the first commercial email system, <i>MCI Mail</i>, and provided input for the packet switching technology that supports the transport of information through the World Wide Web. Vint has won numerous awards, including the "Living Legend" medal from the Library of Congress. He was a co-winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to the creation of the TCP/IP protocol architecture (along with his colleague, Robert Kahn). The pair was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the work that ultimately led to the internet framework that is currently employed.

<p><b>Server:</b> A server is a computer that combines a software program designed to serve other computers' requests, with hardware capable of accepting such requests and accommodating them. In other words, a server responds to client requests and provides the necessary assistance, or at least part of the necessary assistance, required. For example, a gaming server will host a game for other computers, which log on to the server in order to join a multi-player game. A file-sharing server will allow other computers to access its database. A server often boasts enhanced memory capabilities, compared to the average computer. Sometimes, many computers are combined to create a large server.

<p><b>SHA-1:</b> A hash function used in cryptology (see separate entry under <i>Cryptographic Hash</i>), Sha-1 was created by the NSA (National Security Agency). It was first published in 1993 and outputs a 20 byte hash value expressed as a 40 digit hexadecimal number. "SHA" is an acronym for "Secure Hash Algorithm." SHA-1 is the most well known and used SHA hash, and many businesses and agencies use the function to secure data. In 2005, the Sha-1 came under attack by hackers, and the NSA later switched to SHA-2. SHA-3, the newest in the SHA family of hash functions, came out in 2012. Microsoft recently announced that they will no longer accept SHA-1 certificates for Secure Socket Layers (see separate entry) after 2016.

<p><b>Slow-start Algorithm:</b> Before the slow-start algorithm was invented, computers sent data at the speed advertised by the receiving computer. However, other interim routers or gateways would often slow the data and cause clogs in the system. What happened could be compared to a freeway jam when too many cars entered the freeway at once. In order to avoid such jams, Van Jacobson, a  research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, invented the slow-start algorithm, in which sending computers initiated contact with a receiving computer and waited for acknowledgment before sending more data. Each packet sent that received an acknowledgment prompted the sending computer's speed to increase, until it reached its normal level of data transfer. Just as a car waits for an onramp traffic light to turn green before entering a freeway, so too does the sending computer wait for the "green light" from the receiving computer to transport more data through the system. Many experts say that Van Jacobsen's algorithm saved the internet from collapse in the early years of the World Wide Web.

<p><b>Smarr, Larry: </b>Larry Smarr was the first director of the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications). While he was teaching at the University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana in 1983, Smarr wrote a grant proposal to the National Science Foundation. In it, he sought funds to build a supercomputing center to aid researchers and scientists. Seven other university professors added their imprimaturs to Smarr's request, known as the Black Proposal for its cover color. The 10-page document became the first unsolicited proposal that the NSF ever approved. When the four supercomputing centers were built (the NSF funded a fifth one later), Smarr headed the one at the University of Illinois. In 1997, Smarr took the helm at the National Computational Science Alliance. He formed links with dozens of different laboratories, research centers, and universities, creating a network that later spilled over into non-scientific areas of development. Smarr has been at the forefront of many computer-related innovations. He has won awards, including the Delmer S. Fahrney medal from the Franklin Institute, which honors leadership in science or technology.

<p><b>Subdomain:</b> Subdomains are lower level domains dependent upon a domain registered with the DNS (Domain Name System). For example, ebay.com is a domain name registered with the DNS. Subdomains of ebay might include books.ebay.com or clothing.ebay.com, just to name a few possibilities. Subdomains can never stand alone; they must link to a higher level domain. In other words, books.com would take you to an entirely different website than books.ebay.com. Technically, every domain name is a subdomain of the top level domains, such as .org, .com or .net. Most people, however, think of any domain name registered with the DNS as a domain name, and any lower level domains within that organization as subdomains.

<p><b>Symmetric Encryption:</b> See <i>Private Key Encryption.</i></p>
<p><b>TCP/IP protocol:</b> The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, comprises a set of rules that facilitate communication across the internet. The model combines some of the earlier OSI protocols into a four-layer system that standardized the rules and made it easier to share information across a wide variety of networks. The four layers of the TCP/IP system include, from bottom to top: the link layer (sometimes called the network access layer); the internetwork layer, the transport layer and the application layer. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~icucart/networking_basics/4LayersofTCPIPModel.html">http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~icucart/networking_basics/4LayersofTCPIPModel.html</a>)</p>
<p><b>Terabyte:</b> 1024 gigabytes of data storage space or 1000 gigabytes of computer transfer speed. A terabyte is also 8 terabits.  It is abbreviated with a capital "B" (tB) to distinguish the byte from a bit.</p>
<p><b>Traceroute:</b> The traceroute is the path that a packet of information takes between one computer and another. Each packet normally makes a series of "hops," or steps, through various routers and gateways in order to reach its destination. The traceroute will also tell you how many times a packet "timed out" or had to be resent, and traces the entire series of hops. You may find a traceroute for any piece of data by selecting "Command Prompt" in your Accessories file (on Windows). Once the Command Prompt box pops up, you may enter the word: <i>tracert.</i> Add one space, and then type the domain name. For example, the command: "tracert ebay" (without the quotation marks) should bring up the traceroute path from the ebay computer to yours.

<p><b>Transport Layer:</b> In both the TCP/IP and OSI models, the transport layer does what its name suggests. It may be likened to the Fedex or UPS service for the application layer above. Although the two models handle reliability a bit differently, the transport layer also detects errors and provides recovery of data. The layer adds a measure of redundancy and resend capabilities for data packets. It also maintains "flow control" so that the data from the sending computer doesn't overwhelm the receiving computer.

<p><b>Turing, Alan:</b> A "father" of both modern computing and artificial intelligence, Alan Turing spent part of World War 2 as head of "Hut 8," the area of Bletchley Park that decoded German naval ciphers. He devised several methods for decrypting messages coded with Enigma, the German's encryption machine. He invented the "Turing Machine," the prototype for later general use computers, and pioneered many concepts in the computer field that are still relevant today.

<p><b>Web 2.0:</b> The term <i>Web 2.0</i> spawned in a conference that occurred just after the .com bubble burst in the early part of this century. The brainstorm session between Tim O'Reilly, his VP Dale Dougherty, and MediaLive International, was based on the belief that, rather than being overhyped, the web was in fact more important than ever. However, it needed redefining. The differences between the original web, or "Web 1.0," and the new web, "Web 2.0," are numerous. For example, Wikipedia, an interactive, user-input encyclopedia, has replaced the static Britannica Online. Blogging, an interactive method of sharing knowledge, has usurped personal web pages. Tagging, that some call "folksonomy," has replaced directories, or "taxonomy." The basic premise throughout these differences is that Web 2.0 is much more user-friendly and inclusive, while the original web was static and consisted mainly of knowledge imparted, rather than an actual, interactive sharing process. When you add the <b>open</b> part of the equation, as in <i>OpenWeb 2.0</i>, you have a sharing that is less restrictive than the proprietary-based websites of the original web. Open, as in <i>open source</i>, gives rise to more freedom of content. As the web develops, OpenWeb 2.0 symbolizes both the symbiosis and the diminishing line between the downloader and the uploader, between users and creators of content.

<p><b>World Wide Web Consortium:</b> The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3 for short, is an organization dedicated to developing, maintaining and improving web standards and protocols. First conceived by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994, he began the project at MIT by bringing in leaders in the computer field from many different areas, including CERN, where Berners-Lee first invented the World Wide Web. He continues to head the project along with Jeffrey Jaffe, the CEO. Many organizations and governments have joined the W3 and standardized internet protocols used throughout the world.
