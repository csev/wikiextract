<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Attention_to_standards">Attention to standards</span></h2>
<p>When people attend to their own moral standards (are mindful of them), any dishonest action is more likely to be reflected in their self-concept (they will update their self-concept as a consequence of their actions), which in turn will cause people to adhere to a stricter delineation of honest and dishonest behavior. However, when individuals are inattentive to their own moral standards (are mindless of them) their actions are not evaluated relative to their standards, their self-concept is less likely to be updated, and therefore their behavior is likely to diverge from their standards.</p>

<p>Kahneman &amp; Tversky's definition of representativeness: "the degree to which [an event] (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population, and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated". When people rely on representativeness to make judgements, they are likely to judge wrongly because the fact that something is more representative does not make it more likely. This heuristic is used because it is an easy computation. The problem is that people overestimate its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of an event. Thus it can result in neglect of relevant base rates and other cognitive biases.</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Time-inconsistent_preferences">Time-inconsistent preferences</span></h2>
<p>Humans have a systematic tendency to switch towards "vices" (products or activities which are pleasant in the short term) from "virtues" (products or activities which are seen as valuable in the long term) as the moment of consumption approaches, even if this involves changing decisions made in advance. Consider having the choice between getting the day off work tomorrow or getting a day and a half off work one month from now. Suppose you would choose one day off tomorrow. Now suppose that you were asked to make that same choice ten years ago. That is, you were asked then whether you would prefer getting one day off in ten years or getting one and a half days off in ten years and one month. Suppose that then you would have taken the day and a half off. This would be a case of time inconsistency because your relative preferences for tomorrow versus one month from now would be different at two different points in time — namely now versus ten years ago. The decision made ten years ago indicates a preference for delayed gratification, but the decision made just before the fact indicates a preference for immediate pleasure.</p>
