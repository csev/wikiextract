<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_1:_Extrinsic_versus_Intrinsic_Motivation_.2816:58.29">Lecture 1: Extrinsic versus Intrinsic Motivation (16:58)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Extrinsic motivation: sense of completion (accomplishment), feeling of connection, camaraderie and goals. </li>
<li>Meaningful condition compared to Sisyphus condition (Sisyphus was punished by the gods to repeatedly push a single boulder up a big hill; each time, just before reaching the pinnacle, the boulder would get out of his control and roll all the way back down the hill, and he would start over again).</li>
<li>People don't work only for money.</li>
<li>If the work is meaningful the work itself and the social recognition will become part of the rewards.</li>
<li>What can be the ultimate demotivator?  Doing the same task over and over without a sense of progress.  For instance, in the bionicle experiment, participants in the Sisyphus condition had higher "reservation wages" for the same work.</li>
<li>How much did one's love of legos affect the number built in the Sisyphus condition? In the meaningful condition, greater love of legos led to more being built, but this differential increase didn't hold in the Sisyphus condition.</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_2:_Meaning_.284:13.29">Lecture 2: Meaning (4:13)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Purpose and meaning are so important that they can be worth a substantial investment of time and money</li>
<li>It's not a value easy to define because it is subjective.  You have to show your employees how meaningful you find their work.  For instance, Google employees receive 1 day a week to pursue their interests</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_3:_Acknowledgement_.283:31.29">Lecture 3: Acknowledgement (3:31)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledgement is a way to make work meaningful.</li>
<li>Recognition for well-done work became a motivation to continue working and improve the result further.</li>
<li>Compared to the acknowledgement condition, the ignored condition (the work is not evaluated ) and the shredder condition (the work is destroyed without evaluation) led to the same amount of demotivating effect.</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_4:_IKEA_Effect_.2811:49.29">Lecture 4: IKEA Effect (11:49)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Labor leads to love but only when participants are able to complete their creations.</li>
<li>Customization is about more than individual preferences. Efforts invested also increase liking of our own work. However, too much effort may result in negative effects, so we need to strike the right balance.</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_5:_Not-Invented-Here_Bias_.289:36.29">Lecture 5: Not-Invented-Here Bias (9:36)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Definition: the philosophy of social, corporate or institutional cultures that avoid using or buying already existing products, research, standards or knowledge because of their external costs and origins (from wikipedia article). For instance, the inclination to post a new thread indicating a problem, rather than searching for an already-existing report of the same problem.</li>
<li>People like their solutions better than others. Why? 1) Their solutions might be better. 2) idiosyncratic fit 3) act of creation </li>
<li>Not invented here theory results in more time and passion devoted to our ideas and hinders our ability to consider other ideas as well. </li>
<li>Investing even a small amount of energy in a solution makes people like it much more</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_6:_Cognitive_Dissonance_.285:00.29">Lecture 6: Cognitive Dissonance (5:00)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>The tension that results when there is a mismatch between cognition and behaviour. People have a motivational drive that reduces the dissonance by altering existing cognitions, making them look consistent.</li>
<li>Why do we play hard to get? When people are playing hard to get, it will shift their beliefs toward it. Since if you chase somebody and your efforts show you've chased them for a long time, you have to increase you opinions to be in accordance with your behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_7:_Monetary_Stress_and_Performance_.2822:01.29">Lecture 7: Monetary Stress and Performance (22:01)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Contrafreeloading phenomenon: Even animals will perform an operant response to obtain food when abundunt free food is available.</li>
<li>Bonus: the particular payments contingent on one's performance.</li>
<li>The Yerkes-Dodson effect: after the incentives go above certain level, it will go down. Inverse-U relationship. Loss aversion doesn't work here. Performance drops dramatically at the highest level of pay.</li>
<li>Do real life bonuses operate like the gain or loss condition? Do mechanical tasks work differently than mental tasks? The intuition about bonuses increasing performance relies on what we know about mechanical (not mental) tasks.  Bonuses for mental tasks may decrease performance</li>
<li>What drives the highest quality performance? A state of flow - you are consumed by a task</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_8:_Social_Stress_and_Performance_.288:11.29">Lecture 8: Social Stress and Performance (8:11)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Higher motivation does not necessarily translate into better permance.</li>
<li>Clutch player did not make a higher percentage of shots, they just tried more frequently.</li>
</ul>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lecture_9:_Bonuses.2C_Labor_and_Motivation_.2811:48.29">Lecture 9: Bonuses, Labor and Motivation (11:48)</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>What is meant by the phrase "money is only one aspect of motivation"? small amounts of money can move relationships from the social to the financial domain, large amounts can increase motivation but decrease performance, we do not operate by simple rules of reward</li>
<li>What are all of the things that can impact motivation? money, meaning, creation, challenge, ownership, identity, and pride</li>
<li>How do we tap these other elements besides money?  A thoughtful gift can mean much more than money.  For instance, Dan gave an example of a Wall Street employee that didn't receive much of a bonus.  His boss was aware that the employee will have a new born this year and let him use his apartment for free.  So, he can spend more time with his family.  As a result, the employee could no longer see the job in terms of dollar and cents.</li>
<li>What is Adam Smith's view on efficiency?  Work should be specialized, and production line environment is the most effective.  For example, the 12 steps required to create a pin can be made more efficient by separating the tasks.  Adam Smith's ideas are more dominant in a pre-industrial society</li>
<li>What is Karl Mark's view on meaning?  When work has meaning, people are more connected to the output.  Karl Marx ideas make more sense in a knowledge economy.</li>
<li>We need to figure out how to find meaning because it is an important element in any job in the knowledge economy.</li>
