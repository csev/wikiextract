1
00:00:00,690 --&gt; 00:00:03,330
So I want to go into a different issue
now, which is a question of wonder.

2
00:00:04,810 --&gt; 00:00:06,732
Because there's a tendency today in

3
00:00:06,732 --&gt; 00:00:10,090
scholarship of mysticism to demystify
mysticism.

4
00:00:10,090 --&gt; 00:00:14,250
And mysticism, even in its etymology, is
related to the mystery, which is

5
00:00:14,250 --&gt; 00:00:18,762
the title of one of Boehme's books, The
Great Mystery.

6
00:00:18,762 --&gt; 00:00:25,740
And the idea is that really, for me,
mysticism is about mystery.

7
00:00:25,740 --&gt; 00:00:27,460
That it's part of going deeper into the
self,

8
00:00:27,460 --&gt; 00:00:30,220
into the psyche, and into the mystery of
creation.

9
00:00:30,220 --&gt; 00:00:33,190
Because Boehme of course is a very
cosmological thinker.

10
00:00:33,190 --&gt; 00:00:36,670
Anybody who speaks about creation has to
be a cosmological thinker.

11
00:00:36,670 --&gt; 00:00:41,080
He's looking at the cosmos, at astrology,
at alchemy, at the elements, at the stars.

12
00:00:41,080 --&gt; 00:00:42,760
He's looking at the world, not just the
psyche.

13
00:00:42,760 --&gt; 00:00:44,200
It's very important to remember.

14
00:00:44,200 --&gt; 00:00:45,300
I'm given the psychological

15
00:00:45,300 --&gt; 00:00:48,930
interpretation, or kaba, psychological
emphasis.

16
00:00:48,930 --&gt; 00:00:51,120
However, he's also very strongly a
cosmological

17
00:00:51,120 --&gt; 00:00:54,880
thinker, again, influenced by Kabbalistic
cosmology.

18
00:00:54,880 --&gt; 00:00:58,054
Now, when we speak about looking at the
world and at

19
00:00:58,054 --&gt; 00:01:01,820
the psyche, just like another German
philosopher, Kant, said, we look

20
00:01:01,820 --&gt; 00:01:05,450
at the the wonders of the starry, the
mystery of the

21
00:01:05,450 --&gt; 00:01:09,370
starry heavens above and of the human
breast, of the, the heart.

22
00:01:09,370 --&gt; 00:01:13,630
So, he said it very nicely in the 18th
century, that we're speaking

23
00:01:13,630 --&gt; 00:01:16,160
about a double mystery, the mystery of the
self and the mystery of

24
00:01:16,160 --&gt; 00:01:17,150
the world.

25
00:01:17,150 --&gt; 00:01:18,840
And mysticism for Boehme and for other

26
00:01:18,840 --&gt; 00:01:21,410
thinkers is going deeper into this
mystery.

27
00:01:21,410 --&gt; 00:01:22,775
It's not resolving this.

28
00:01:22,775 --&gt; 00:01:26,490
Because it's a creative ongoing process.
You can't resolve it, in a way.

29
00:01:26,490 --&gt; 00:01:29,260
It's like, a bit like Freud wrote
psychoanalysis interminable.

30
00:01:29,260 --&gt; 00:01:31,240
It's not something you can finish.

31
00:01:31,240 --&gt; 00:01:37,700
Now, image 85, it says the life of all and
every creature is a wonder.

32
00:01:37,700 --&gt; 00:01:41,130
Life as a, a force of power, of will, of
desire,

33
00:01:41,130 --&gt; 00:01:41,630
is a wonder.

34
00:01:42,680 --&gt; 00:01:44,870
And then, image 92, he's got this
Messianic

35
00:01:44,870 --&gt; 00:01:48,160
discussion, because he's also a messianic,
apocalyptic thinker,

36
00:01:48,160 --&gt; 00:01:51,010
like many Kabbalistic thinkers of the 17th
century,

37
00:01:51,010 --&gt; 00:01:53,720
the, the century of Shabbetai Tzvi, for
instance.

38
00:01:53,720 --&gt; 00:01:59,926
And he speaks about a verse, Isaiah 9:6,
which speaks about

39
00:01:59,926 --&gt; 00:02:06,380
Pele Yo'etz, the, wondrous advisor.
It's a description of a Messianic

40
00:02:06,380 --&gt; 00:02:07,080
figure, I guess.

41
00:02:07,080 --&gt; 00:02:08,700
This is certainly how it's been
interpreted.

42
00:02:08,700 --&gt; 00:02:11,488
So we speak, and he speaks about the power
of wonder,

43
00:02:11,488 --&gt; 00:02:15,660
that wonder is not something which
paralyzes you, that makes you stop.

44
00:02:15,660 --&gt; 00:02:17,340
On the contrary, if you wonder, you go

45
00:02:17,340 --&gt; 00:02:20,220
deeper, you discover deeper about
yourself, about the world.

46
00:02:20,220 --&gt; 00:02:21,440
It has power in it.

47
00:02:21,440 --&gt; 00:02:25,170
That's why the Messiah is a wondrous
figure, is a wondering figure.

48
00:02:25,170 --&gt; 00:02:31,940
And this very much recalls a 20th century,
Jewish thinker who starts

49
00:02:31,940 --&gt; 00:02:34,000
out in Germany and then moves to the
United States,

50
00:02:34,000 --&gt; 00:02:37,260
soon he brought the German tradition to
some extent, called Abraham

51
00:02:37,260 --&gt; 00:02:40,924
Joshua Heschel, somebody from a Hasidic
background, descendant of a

52
00:02:40,924 --&gt; 00:02:45,620
Hasidic leader by the same name, Abraham
Joshua Heschel of Apta.

53
00:02:45,620 --&gt; 00:02:47,440
And Heschel, a very important 20th century

54
00:02:47,440 --&gt; 00:02:50,190
Jewish figure, speaks a lot about this
issue

55
00:02:50,190 --&gt; 00:02:55,280
of wonder and mystery and I want to relate
here wonder and mystery to esotericism.

56
00:02:55,280 --&gt; 00:02:57,685
It always goes together with mysticism.

57
00:02:57,685 --&gt; 00:02:58,840
There's actually a program at Rice

58
00:02:58,840 --&gt; 00:03:02,330
University called GEM, gnosticism,
esotericism, mysticism.

59
00:03:02,330 --&gt; 00:03:07,490
I think it's a very nice title because
there's certain gnostic elements here.

60
00:03:07,490 --&gt; 00:03:12,650
The elements of evil forces in creation,
or negative forces, or angry forces.

61
00:03:12,650 --&gt; 00:03:15,370
There's esoteric elements here, of course,
of secrets and mystery.

62
00:03:15,370 --&gt; 00:03:16,510
And there's also mysticism.

63
00:03:17,528 --&gt; 00:03:19,570
And actually Boehme, as our key mythical
thinker,

64
00:03:19,570 --&gt; 00:03:22,570
would certainly not object to the word,
gem.

65
00:03:22,570 --&gt; 00:03:23,070
Now,

66
00:03:24,230 --&gt; 00:03:27,780
I want to move on a bit to, another issue.

67
00:03:27,780 --&gt; 00:03:30,480
After we've spoken about will, we've
spoken about wonder,

68
00:03:30,480 --&gt; 00:03:32,080
I want to speak as usual about the soul.

69
00:03:33,790 --&gt; 00:03:37,820
Now, in image 97 is the following
statement.

70
00:03:37,820 --&gt; 00:03:39,320
So, and of course this is from a very

71
00:03:39,320 --&gt; 00:03:43,360
old 17th century English translation, but
it's a good translation.

72
00:03:43,360 --&gt; 00:03:46,410
I don't have the I have Yiddish we but we,

73
00:03:46,410 --&gt; 00:03:49,490
I don't have the tools to go into, 17th
century German.

74
00:03:49,490 --&gt; 00:03:51,150
So we'll do it in English.

75
00:03:51,150 --&gt; 00:03:54,420
So there is nothing higher in the soul, so
there is nothing

76
00:03:54,420 --&gt; 00:03:59,140
that can break it, for all is under it and
in it.

77
00:03:59,140 --&gt; 00:04:01,710
So, first of all, all is under it and

78
00:04:01,710 --&gt; 00:04:05,170
in it, the soul really, what's under the
soul.

79
00:04:05,170 --&gt; 00:04:07,250
You go deeper and reveal more secrets of
the

80
00:04:07,250 --&gt; 00:04:09,810
soul, and in the soul, everything is in
it.

81
00:04:09,810 --&gt; 00:04:12,168
Its all about the soul.
There's nothing higher than the soul.

82
00:04:12,168 --&gt; 00:04:14,512
You can't go any further.
There's a

83
00:04:14,512 --&gt; 00:04:16,194
text, a very ancient Greek text by

84
00:04:16,194 --&gt; 00:04:18,572
Herocletus, who was a very dialectic
agonistic

85
00:04:18,572 --&gt; 00:04:22,805
kind of ancient philosopher that Heidegger
liked a lot, and so on, and Nietzsche.

86
00:04:22,805 --&gt; 00:04:25,213
And that leads us to one of his dynamic
philosophers

87
00:04:25,213 --&gt; 00:04:28,402
who's quoted by James [INAUDIBLE] who I've
mentioned quite a bit.

88
00:04:28,402 --&gt; 00:04:32,310
And he reads this statement by him, this
fragment that says

89
00:04:32,310 --&gt; 00:04:35,600
you cannot exhaust the soul, that's what I
said, it's interminable.

90
00:04:35,600 --&gt; 00:04:40,380
Because you can't exhaust its depth, its
baffles, its, you can't go deeper

91
00:04:40,380 --&gt; 00:04:42,460
than, than the soul because it's, it's
infinitely deep.

92
00:04:42,460 --&gt; 00:04:45,530
You just go deeper and deeper all the
time.

93
00:04:45,530 --&gt; 00:04:49,050
Now, the soul is everything.

94
00:04:49,050 --&gt; 00:04:51,720
So this is what some scholars call the
pantheism of the soul.

95
00:04:51,720 --&gt; 00:04:54,770
It's not that God is everywhere so much as
that the soul is everywhere.

96
00:04:54,770 --&gt; 00:04:55,840
Of course the soul is defined.

97
00:04:57,240 --&gt; 00:05:00,540
And I also hear a slight political
overtone here as soon, I'll

98
00:05:00,540 --&gt; 00:05:04,920
speak about the politics of Burma in
saying nothing can break the soul.

99
00:05:04,920 --&gt; 00:05:05,390
The connection

100
00:05:05,390 --&gt; 00:05:06,580
to the soul is unbreakable.

101
00:05:06,580 --&gt; 00:05:09,240
There's no Earthly power that can break
this connection.

102
00:05:10,560 --&gt; 00:05:12,270
And that's what he goes on to say.

103
00:05:12,270 --&gt; 00:05:13,640
It's more developed in image 118.

104
00:05:13,640 --&gt; 00:05:18,610
There's nothing in the world that can
touch or kill the soul.

105
00:05:18,610 --&gt; 00:05:20,300
No fire, no sword.

106
00:05:21,650 --&gt; 00:05:23,580
I want to say there's one thing that can
do it.

107
00:05:23,580 --&gt; 00:05:26,900
That first of all as a stunt, almost
political statement.

108
00:05:26,900 --&gt; 00:05:28,530
There's no power greater than that of a
soul.

109
00:05:28,530 --&gt; 00:05:30,360
No sword, no fire.

110
00:05:30,360 --&gt; 00:05:33,600
We'll soon speak about fire can, can reach
a soul.

111
00:05:33,600 --&gt; 00:05:37,990
But only says what can, the imagination,
that is, it's poison.

112
00:05:37,990 --&gt; 00:05:39,810
It's like there's one poison that works on
the soul.

113
00:05:39,810 --&gt; 00:05:41,340
That's imagination.

114
00:05:41,340 --&gt; 00:05:44,070
For it originally preceded out of the
imagination.

115
00:05:44,070 --&gt; 00:05:49,190
The soul was born in this fiery process
out of the imagination.

116
00:05:49,190 --&gt; 00:05:52,590
And therefore the only thing no fire can
destroy is imagination.

117
00:05:52,590 --&gt; 00:05:55,900
Except the power of, of the soul.
So except the imagination,

118
00:05:55,900 --&gt; 00:06:01,090
because the soul was made, alchemically
speaking, was forged in the imagination.

119
00:06:01,090 --&gt; 00:06:05,189
Now Lord of the Rings fans will really see
where I'm going.

120
00:06:05,189 --&gt; 00:06:08,113
The Ring of Power which is a very, Tolkien
took from

121
00:06:08,113 --&gt; 00:06:10,221
the, also from the German tradition

122
00:06:10,221 --&gt; 00:06:13,724
another sort of proto-Fascist thinker,
Bucknell.

123
00:06:13,724 --&gt; 00:06:18,098
In the German mystical tradition, he,
what's, the Lord

124
00:06:18,098 --&gt; 00:06:20,933
of the Rings says that the Ring of Power
can

125
00:06:20,933 --&gt; 00:06:23,021
only be unmade at its source.

126
00:06:23,021 --&gt; 00:06:25,793
There's no fire that can burn it except

127
00:06:25,793 --&gt; 00:06:29,520
the source where it was forged in Mount
Doom.

128
00:06:29,520 --&gt; 00:06:31,455
So it's a very, interesting connection
here

129
00:06:31,455 --&gt; 00:06:33,300
to fantasy which we've mentioned a few
times.

130
00:06:35,880 --&gt; 00:06:39,210
Now this is very much very Jungian.

131
00:06:39,210 --&gt; 00:06:41,830
The soul is really about imagining, about
imagination.

132
00:06:41,830 --&gt; 00:06:44,160
Desire is about imagination.

133
00:06:44,160 --&gt; 00:06:47,910
This is Jungian, human, and also Lacan,
the idea

134
00:06:47,910 --&gt; 00:06:52,110
that desire is, is related to the
imaginal, the imaginary.

135
00:06:53,320 --&gt; 00:06:57,090
So what I'm doing here is a slightly
strong interpretation of Boehme.

136
00:06:57,090 --&gt; 00:07:01,395
I'm not going with the plain sense of the
text so much, but looking again following

137
00:07:01,395 --&gt; 00:07:04,885
Boehme's own direction, looking at the
deeper, more

138
00:07:04,885 --&gt; 00:07:09,160
esoteric layer behind the text, and I want
to

139
00:07:09,160 --&gt; 00:07:14,660
speak about, the importance of doing
psychoanalytic interpretation is

140
00:07:14,660 --&gt; 00:07:18,470
because psychoanalytic interpretation is
oriented towards the hidden layer.

141
00:07:18,470 --&gt; 00:07:19,630
That's what happens in analysis.

142
00:07:19,630 --&gt; 00:07:22,330
You don't take the surface value of what
people are saying.

143
00:07:22,330 --&gt; 00:07:24,040
What you hear is what you get.

144
00:07:24,040 --&gt; 00:07:26,820
But the analyst is listening in a very
subtle way

145
00:07:26,820 --&gt; 00:07:29,500
for the overtones and for the undertones
and

146
00:07:29,500 --&gt; 00:07:33,310
for the subtle layer of symbolism or
imagination.

147
00:07:33,310 --&gt; 00:07:35,554
Behind the, the blank statement that at

148
00:07:35,554 --&gt; 00:07:39,010
least, that is saying, the patient was
saying.

149
00:07:39,010 --&gt; 00:07:40,706
And I think one should read this kind of

150
00:07:40,706 --&gt; 00:07:42,950
texts and maybe other mystical texts in
this way.

151
00:07:42,950 --&gt; 00:07:46,870
So I think Elliott Wolfson is very correct
that psychoanalysis can be

152
00:07:46,870 --&gt; 00:07:49,380
an interesting tool in mystical studies

153
00:07:49,380 --&gt; 00:07:52,770
because it's also about discovering secret
symbolism.

154
00:07:52,770 --&gt; 00:07:57,650
As long as one respects the psychology of
the text themselves and

155
00:07:57,650 --&gt; 00:08:00,620
doesn't impose the, which I don't think
Wilson is doing but maybe

156
00:08:00,620 --&gt; 00:08:03,315
others do, don't impose the psychoanalytic

157
00:08:03,315 --&gt; 00:08:07,290
late 19th century German European
tradition

158
00:08:07,290 --&gt; 00:08:09,750
on the 17th century, you, maybe

159
00:08:09,750 --&gt; 00:08:12,070
central European tradition of Boehme, for
instance.

160
00:08:13,290 --&gt; 00:08:16,850
Now the important thing is the primacy of
a soul.

161
00:08:16,850 --&gt; 00:08:18,200
So we spoke about the will.

162
00:08:18,200 --&gt; 00:08:19,210
We've spoken about the wonder.

163
00:08:19,210 --&gt; 00:08:22,850
And now we're speaking about the soul, the
depth of a soul, the power

164
00:08:22,850 --&gt; 00:08:26,720
of a soul, the mystery of a soul, and the
relationship between soul and imagination.
