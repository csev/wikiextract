00:00:00,190 --&gt; 00:00:03,370
We've spoken about the move to America,
and a lot of these

2
00:00:03,370 --&gt; 00:00:07,620
groups, the Quakers, the Shakers, and so
on, begin to develop in America.

3
00:00:08,800 --&gt; 00:00:12,450
There's a lot of interest developments in
American religion.

4
00:00:12,450 --&gt; 00:00:14,120
There's a lot of research now emerging on
it

5
00:00:14,120 --&gt; 00:00:17,180
in Indiana University, other places, and
one of the

6
00:00:17,180 --&gt; 00:00:19,100
things I don't envy the scholars of
American religion

7
00:00:19,100 --&gt; 00:00:20,840
is is to keep track of all the awakenings.

8
00:00:20,840 --&gt; 00:00:22,460
because all the time there's like these
waves of

9
00:00:22,460 --&gt; 00:00:25,730
great awakenings that people do revival
meet, meetings and there's

10
00:00:25,730 --&gt; 00:00:28,380
a whole literature which is developed and
people get into

11
00:00:28,380 --&gt; 00:00:31,780
very intense states of trance and shaking
and so on.

12
00:00:31,780 --&gt; 00:00:35,195
And it's very much to do with feminine
figures often.

13
00:00:35,195 --&gt; 00:00:37,000
And there's a lot of literature on this.

14
00:00:37,000 --&gt; 00:00:39,520
And we've got the first Great Awakening in
the 18th century but

15
00:00:39,520 --&gt; 00:00:42,230
then there's a whole series in the 19th,
even the 20th century.

16
00:00:43,260 --&gt; 00:00:46,700
And I want, I want to speak a bit about
the 19th century, because a lot

17
00:00:46,700 --&gt; 00:00:50,940
of our, our work up until now has been in
the 16th, 17th, and 18th century.

18
00:00:50,940 --&gt; 00:00:54,200
Now, on one level of 19th century there's
a certain decline of mysticism.

19
00:00:54,200 --&gt; 00:00:56,580
It's a Victorian period in, in the English

20
00:00:56,580 --&gt; 00:01:00,820
context, and the Industrial Revolution
gets into full steam.

21
00:01:00,820 --&gt; 00:01:05,520
And there's a Darwin, there's all kind of
marks.

22
00:01:05,520 --&gt; 00:01:06,900
There's a strong critique of religion.

23
00:01:08,690 --&gt; 00:01:11,970
Much stronger role for science and
technology.

24
00:01:11,970 --&gt; 00:01:16,020
Mysticism seems to be, seems to be pushed
aside, but it's not exactly that.

25
00:01:16,020 --&gt; 00:01:20,610
This is a slight decline but Hasidism
still goes strong.

26
00:01:20,610 --&gt; 00:01:24,800
We're speaking about, spoken about, nin-,
late nineteenth century Hasidic movements.

27
00:01:24,800 --&gt; 00:01:27,060
We've got all these awakenings in America.

28
00:01:27,060 --&gt; 00:01:29,390
At the end of the 19th century we've got a
literary movement.

29
00:01:31,050 --&gt; 00:01:35,950
People like Emerson and Thoreau and
Whitman, Walt Whitman all

30
00:01:35,950 --&gt; 00:01:40,040
the figures that feature in the movie Dead
Poet Society.

31
00:01:41,480 --&gt; 00:01:44,510
which, we've got the sort of American
transcendentalism movement.

32
00:01:44,510 --&gt; 00:01:47,350
It's a literary movement, it's a mystical
movement, it's

33
00:01:47,350 --&gt; 00:01:50,070
all related in, in complex ways, to these
awakenings.

34
00:01:50,070 --&gt; 00:01:55,330
And actually this is the, these are the
ancestors, or ancestors of

35
00:01:55,330 --&gt; 00:01:58,460
the new age of today, of the, the, the
current mystical revival.

36
00:02:00,330 --&gt; 00:02:02,480
There's a scholar, Courtney Bender in
Columbia,

37
00:02:02,480 --&gt; 00:02:04,700
who's written an important book about
this.

38
00:02:04,700 --&gt; 00:02:07,680
So the, we have

39
00:02:07,680 --&gt; 00:02:10,630
again, America becomes a more central
player in the mystical world.

40
00:02:10,630 --&gt; 00:02:12,470
It's not only about Europe, there's
inference

41
00:02:12,470 --&gt; 00:02:15,430
going backwards and forwards between
Europe and America.

42
00:02:15,430 --&gt; 00:02:17,593
This becomes like a shared mystical
culture.

43
00:02:17,593 --&gt; 00:02:22,410
Around the turn of the 20th century we've
got a great mystical awakening.

44
00:02:22,410 --&gt; 00:02:28,450
We've got the the whole spiritualist
movement of seances and trance and so on.

45
00:02:28,450 --&gt; 00:02:30,700
We've got strong upsurge of Christian
forms

46
00:02:30,700 --&gt; 00:02:33,440
of Kabbalah around the turn of the
century.

47
00:02:33,440 --&gt; 00:02:34,770
We've got all, all kinds of interesting

48
00:02:34,770 --&gt; 00:02:37,160
developments in Russia that we won't go
into.

49
00:02:37,160 --&gt; 00:02:40,490
The beginnings of influence from the Far
East are beginning to come in.

50
00:02:40,490 --&gt; 00:02:43,000
And really the twentieth century is really
a globalized mysticism.

51
00:02:43,000 --&gt; 00:02:44,810
It's no longer about European mysticism.

52
00:02:44,810 --&gt; 00:02:47,360
We've got a European mysticism with
connections to

53
00:02:47,360 --&gt; 00:02:49,970
America, with increasing connections to
the Far East.

54
00:02:51,520 --&gt; 00:02:54,090
We've spoken about a few parallels to the
Far East today.

55
00:02:54,090 --&gt; 00:02:58,510
It's already a different game.
So slight decline in 19th

56
00:02:58,510 --&gt; 00:03:03,270
century, a resurgence in the 20th, around
the world wars in other decline, people

57
00:03:03,270 --&gt; 00:03:06,900
were busy with the wars, they were with
the Great Depression and so on.

58
00:03:06,900 --&gt; 00:03:10,360
Didn't really have the psychic space for
mysticism, but

59
00:03:10,360 --&gt; 00:03:14,030
in the 50s, 60s, 70s, this really gets
restarted again.

60
00:03:15,030 --&gt; 00:03:18,450
And it's important not to lose sight of
all these complex connections,

61
00:03:18,450 --&gt; 00:03:20,480
reaching backwards, and how Kabbalah
always

62
00:03:20,480 --&gt; 00:03:22,580
seems to be somehow in the background.

63
00:03:22,580 --&gt; 00:03:24,010
Now of

64
00:03:24,010 --&gt; 00:03:26,070
course unless we're speaking about the Far
East.

65
00:03:26,070 --&gt; 00:03:32,010
Now, what I'm going to do really here is
to to speak about, before,

66
00:03:32,010 --&gt; 00:03:37,598
in the last class we'll return very much
to the 20th, 21st Century.

67
00:03:37,598 --&gt; 00:03:40,536
We'll wrap it all up, and we'll speak a
lot about what's happening today.

68
00:03:40,536 --&gt; 00:03:44,684
Things which I've sort of mentioned in
bits and pieces but before that I want

69
00:03:44,684 --&gt; 00:03:46,148
to really zero in a bit more on

70
00:03:46,148 --&gt; 00:03:49,381
the Protestant world and the German
Protestant mysticism

71
00:03:49,381 --&gt; 00:03:54,110
because I was speaking, I was speaking
today much more about Spain and Italy

72
00:03:54,110 --&gt; 00:03:57,740
About the, the Catholic world with some

73
00:03:57,740 --&gt; 00:04:00,020
discussions about Flanders and so on, and
England.

74
00:04:01,110 --&gt; 00:04:05,450
and, but, really one needs to speak much

75
00:04:05,450 --&gt; 00:04:09,080
more about German mysticism, which has
strong pre-modern roots.

76
00:04:09,080 --&gt; 00:04:15,150
Meister Eckhart, that's Eckhart, a very
important

77
00:04:15,150 --&gt; 00:04:20,260
mystic with a bit of antinomian flavor, a
bit of passive kind of discourse.

78
00:04:20,260 --&gt; 00:04:23,460
Really, one of the roots, pre-modern
roots, of all

79
00:04:23,460 --&gt; 00:04:26,710
of the modern movements we've been
speaking about today.

80
00:04:26,710 --&gt; 00:04:28,260
So that's what we'll do next time.
