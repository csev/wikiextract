1
00:00:00,570 --&gt; 00:00:03,360
Now, we've, we've gone over the general
history.

2
00:00:03,360 --&gt; 00:00:08,420
I want to speak more about the specific
history of 18th-19th century

3
00:00:08,420 --&gt; 00:00:13,320
Romania and Russia, moving from Greece
through the Balkans to Russia, and the

4
00:00:13,320 --&gt; 00:00:18,560
possible contact of the Hasidic movement,
which developed in, more or less,

5
00:00:18,560 --&gt; 00:00:20,690
the Carpathian mountains, the Romanian
Carpathian

6
00:00:20,690 --&gt; 00:00:22,726
mountains, and then moved deep into
Russia.

7
00:00:22,726 --&gt; 00:00:26,670
So, Moshe Idel,

8
00:00:26,670 --&gt; 00:00:30,360
who I've mentioned already, has a study
which is still developing, but part of it

9
00:00:30,360 --&gt; 00:00:33,370
has already been published, about the
possible context

10
00:00:33,370 --&gt; 00:00:37,100
between the Hasidic movement in this
geographical area.

11
00:00:37,100 --&gt; 00:00:39,250
Because at this time, there was a

12
00:00:39,250 --&gt; 00:00:42,360
very exciting development in the Hesychast
movement.

13
00:00:43,450 --&gt; 00:00:45,790
Throughout the 18th and 19th century, a
wave of

14
00:00:45,790 --&gt; 00:00:52,030
translations in Greek, Russian, of texts,
of a variety

15
00:00:52,030 --&gt; 00:00:54,920
of texts form the 14th to 15th

16
00:00:54,920 --&gt; 00:00:58,890
century called the Philokalia, which is
readily available.

17
00:00:58,890 --&gt; 00:01:04,130
And these translations really concentrated
the texts, which are the core texts of

18
00:01:04,130 --&gt; 00:01:06,920
the Hesychast movement, and made them not

19
00:01:06,920 --&gt; 00:01:09,200
very widely available, but more widely
available.

20
00:01:10,370 --&gt; 00:01:11,860
And we'll be speaking about a certain

21
00:01:11,860 --&gt; 00:01:15,498
figure, Theophan, who was involved in this
movement.

22
00:01:15,498 --&gt; 00:01:17,338
Now, what Idel pointed

23
00:01:17,338 --&gt; 00:01:20,466
out was this movement of [UNKNOWN] reach
of

24
00:01:20,466 --&gt; 00:01:24,514
the mystical Hesychast movement takes
places in the

25
00:01:24,514 --&gt; 00:01:27,642
time and in the place where Hasidism also

26
00:01:27,642 --&gt; 00:01:32,110
tried to make Jewish mysticism more widely
available.

27
00:01:32,110 --&gt; 00:01:36,285
And he focuses on a few other common
characteristics.

28
00:01:36,285 --&gt; 00:01:42,520
The focus on constant prayer, which we can
find in Hasidism, the focus on seclusion.

29
00:01:42,520 --&gt; 00:01:45,420
A lot of the members of this movement
would seclude themselves

30
00:01:45,420 --&gt; 00:01:48,020
in caves, a way, which is something which
is also found in

31
00:01:48,020 --&gt; 00:01:52,730
the Tibetan world in the Far East, and,
would physically seclude

32
00:01:52,730 --&gt; 00:01:57,900
themselves, in order to pray, which is the
Hasidic idea of Hitbodedut.

33
00:01:57,900 --&gt; 00:01:58,470
That's in Hebrew.

34
00:01:58,470 --&gt; 00:02:00,632
That's, H I T B O D E D U T, is

35
00:02:00,632 --&gt; 00:02:08,350
probably the best translation of secluding
oneself in order to pray more intensely.

36
00:02:08,350 --&gt; 00:02:14,554
The idea of a spiritual mystical leader,
in Russian

37
00:02:14,554 --&gt; 00:02:21,760
terms, [UNKNOWN] elders and the the
Hasidic Tzadik.

38
00:02:21,760 --&gt; 00:02:26,500
So we've got the idea of leaders, of
mystical people who have attained

39
00:02:26,500 --&gt; 00:02:31,560
something and become the nexus, the center
of a wider group of followers.

40
00:02:31,560 --&gt; 00:02:33,440
So it's also similar to Hasidism.
And,

41
00:02:34,480 --&gt; 00:02:36,370
I would add, and this is something which
has been

42
00:02:36,370 --&gt; 00:02:38,690
pointed about by Ted Campbell in his
Religion of the

43
00:02:38,690 --&gt; 00:02:41,800
Heart book, which is in the syllabus, that
he's pointed

44
00:02:41,800 --&gt; 00:02:43,670
out, that this is part of the religion of
the heart.

45
00:02:43,670 --&gt; 00:02:47,630
That both Hasidism and the Hesychast
revival focused very much on

46
00:02:47,630 --&gt; 00:02:51,960
heart and the internal dimension, on the
heart, on the soul.

47
00:02:51,960 --&gt; 00:02:56,010
Actually is the, is the term hesychasm
comes from stillness, and stillness is

48
00:02:56,010 --&gt; 00:02:59,800
the stillness, not of the natural body,
also of the body but especially

49
00:02:59,800 --&gt; 00:03:00,580
of the soul.

50
00:03:00,580 --&gt; 00:03:03,430
One has to reach a deep internal
stillness.

51
00:03:03,430 --&gt; 00:03:05,500
Now how does one reach the stillness?

52
00:03:05,500 --&gt; 00:03:09,170
So we spoke about various techniques.

53
00:03:09,170 --&gt; 00:03:11,140
And these techniques have to do with

54
00:03:11,140 --&gt; 00:03:15,160
an experience, mystical experiences,
especially experience of light.

55
00:03:16,580 --&gt; 00:03:21,500
So, the experience of lights that Jesus
experienced in

56
00:03:21,500 --&gt; 00:03:25,110
the Gospels on Mount Tabor, not far from
here,

57
00:03:25,110 --&gt; 00:03:28,910
also in Israel.

58
00:03:28,910 --&gt; 00:03:33,060
The Hesychast ideal is to make this
experience available to everybody, very

59
00:03:33,060 --&gt; 00:03:34,600
similar to the Hasidic ideal of

60
00:03:34,600 --&gt; 00:03:37,640
making mystical experiences available to
everybody.

61
00:03:37,640 --&gt; 00:03:39,400
Just like we, the story that the Messiah

62
00:03:39,400 --&gt; 00:03:42,530
tells the founder of Hasidism about
Shem-Tov, who again,

63
00:03:42,530 --&gt; 00:03:46,670
operated, began his development in his
isolation, in his

64
00:03:46,670 --&gt; 00:03:50,290
seclusion in the Carpathian Mountains, in
the same area.

65
00:03:50,290 --&gt; 00:03:53,380
And the Messiah says to him that, I will
come when

66
00:03:53,380 --&gt; 00:03:55,690
everybody will be able to do these
techniques like you can.

67
00:03:57,200 --&gt; 00:03:59,980
Now, when you spread your techniques so
that everybody will

68
00:03:59,980 --&gt; 00:04:03,260
be able to have this experience, it will
become more available.

69
00:04:03,260 --&gt; 00:04:04,650
But, I want to move a bit away from

70
00:04:04,650 --&gt; 00:04:07,580
the focus on techniques, because it can be
misleading,

71
00:04:07,580 --&gt; 00:04:09,600
as if one is in a narrow path of

72
00:04:09,600 --&gt; 00:04:12,000
practicing certain techniques, however

73
00:04:12,000 --&gt; 00:04:14,570
frequently, and getting certain
experiences.

74
00:04:14,570 --&gt; 00:04:15,440
The idea

75
00:04:15,440 --&gt; 00:04:18,110
that we'll be developing now through
reading the books

76
00:04:18,110 --&gt; 00:04:22,490
is the idea of constant change, of
constant transformation.

77
00:04:22,490 --&gt; 00:04:23,840
We're not speaking about techniques.

78
00:04:23,840 --&gt; 00:04:26,990
We're speaking about a path, of being on a
certain path

79
00:04:26,990 --&gt; 00:04:29,350
all the time, through constant prayer,

80
00:04:29,350 --&gt; 00:04:32,110
through psychological processes, and here
through

81
00:04:32,110 --&gt; 00:04:36,430
shifts of focus from the body, from the
psychic centers, from

82
00:04:36,430 --&gt; 00:04:40,790
the psychosomatic, from the focus on the
heart, on the abdomen, and

83
00:04:40,790 --&gt; 00:04:45,250
so on, to a different realm, to a realm
which is more psychological.

84
00:04:46,390 --&gt; 00:04:50,130
Now, before concluding this brief
discussion, I also want to

85
00:04:50,130 --&gt; 00:04:52,890
again say that many of these techniques
and ideas can

86
00:04:52,890 --&gt; 00:04:57,100
be found in the Sufi movement, in Islamic
mysticism, which

87
00:04:57,100 --&gt; 00:05:01,060
also was still and is still found in the
Balkans.

88
00:05:01,060 --&gt; 00:05:03,150
And of course the early origins of
Hesychasm

89
00:05:03,150 --&gt; 00:05:06,230
in the Near East were in constant dialogue
with

90
00:05:06,230 --&gt; 00:05:09,180
also the Muslim world from its, the
beginnings of Muslim mysticism.

91
00:05:10,500 --&gt; 00:05:14,310
And reciprocal influence, I would say.

92
00:05:15,500 --&gt; 00:05:18,590
And of course the minute we are speaking
about the Muslim world also

93
00:05:18,590 --&gt; 00:05:20,700
one has to recall there is Islamic

94
00:05:20,700 --&gt; 00:05:23,410
translations of Yoga text, of Buddhist
text.

95
00:05:23,410 --&gt; 00:05:25,950
But as the Buddhist world is not far away,

96
00:05:25,950 --&gt; 00:05:28,990
especially when you're speaking about the
Russian context also.

97
00:05:28,990 --&gt; 00:05:30,890
So, but this is not our field.

98
00:05:30,890 --&gt; 00:05:31,200
That is,

99
00:05:31,200 --&gt; 00:05:33,060
we're not, we're doing control comparison.

100
00:05:33,060 --&gt; 00:05:36,180
I'm just mentioning this because it's
interesting, but it's not our focus here.
