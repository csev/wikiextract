00:00:00,320 --&gt; 00:00:05,650
I want to speak about another movement
related to this whole religion

2
00:00:05,650 --&gt; 00:00:10,300
of the heart, which is the movement of
devotion to the sacred heart,

3
00:00:10,300 --&gt; 00:00:13,650
Sacre Coeur.  There is a nice church like that,
in-by that name in Paris.

4
00:00:15,054 --&gt; 00:00:17,240
The heart of Jesus, but also of Mary.

5
00:00:17,240 --&gt; 00:00:20,250
Now, this is an older movement, but it
became very strong in

6
00:00:20,250 --&gt; 00:00:23,990
the 17th and 18th century and throughout
a lot of controversy, as usual.

7
00:00:25,050 --&gt; 00:00:25,430
And they speak

8
00:00:25,430 --&gt; 00:00:28,210
about what we call in academic language,

9
00:00:28,210 --&gt; 00:00:30,760
unio mystica, the mystical union, the
union of

10
00:00:30,760 --&gt; 00:00:33,620
the heart of the believer with the heart
of Christ, with the heart of Mary.

11
00:00:35,580 --&gt; 00:00:37,452
And there's a whole--it's part to do--it's

12
00:00:37,452 --&gt; 00:00:39,870
to do with this whole awakening of
feminine spirituality.

13
00:00:39,870 --&gt; 00:00:42,270
It's a movement which involves a lot of
women, and

14
00:00:42,270 --&gt; 00:00:44,680
it's really about devotion to a woman, to
a large extent.

15
00:00:45,930 --&gt; 00:00:50,260
And the 18th century, remember, is also the
beginning of the feminist movement.

16
00:00:50,260 --&gt; 00:00:50,920
The &quot;Vindication

17
00:00:50,920 --&gt; 00:00:52,810
of the Rights of Women&quot; book and so on and
so forth.

18
00:00:52,810 --&gt; 00:00:53,310
And,

19
00:00:55,060 --&gt; 00:00:58,180
there's a lot of talk about emotion,

20
00:00:58,180 --&gt; 00:01:01,208
which often goes together with feminine
spirituality.

21
00:01:01,208 --&gt; 00:01:02,780
About fire which we've spoken about,

22
00:01:02,780 --&gt; 00:01:03,810
the fire of the heart,

23
00:01:05,230 --&gt; 00:01:06,650
forms of psychic energy really.

24
00:01:08,070 --&gt; 00:01:12,120
And now I want to speak about one figure
in this movement,

25
00:01:12,120 --&gt; 00:01:15,750
Anne Lee, who is related to, the Shaker
movement, which is part of

26
00:01:15,750 --&gt; 00:01:20,080
the whole family of religion of the heart
kind of movements, that afterwards,

27
00:01:20,080 --&gt; 00:01:22,260
moved to America.
We'll speak about this soon.

28
00:01:22,260 --&gt; 00:01:23,970
And the, the Shakers, the Quakers, to

29
00:01:23,970 --&gt; 00:01:26,540
which I'm indebted to for my morning
cereal.

30
00:01:28,120 --&gt; 00:01:31,090
Now Anne Lee speaks about the feminine

31
00:01:31,090 --&gt; 00:01:33,240
principle which is equal to the male
Christ.

32
00:01:33,240 --&gt; 00:01:35,610
This is quite radical, but the feminine
principle

33
00:01:35,610 --&gt; 00:01:37,430
of Mary--which is not exactly Mary,it's

34
00:01:37,430 --&gt; 00:01:40,710
even wider than Mary--it was not exactly
like

35
00:01:40,710 --&gt; 00:01:44,185
the Catholic idea of-of devotion to Mary--
is-uhm

36
00:01:45,390 --&gt; 00:01:48,150
the feminine principle is equal to that
of a male Christ.

37
00:01:49,200 --&gt; 00:01:51,426
Now, here, I want to go back a minute to
backtrack

38
00:01:51,426 --&gt; 00:01:53,705
a bit, to a early modern figure, because
all the time

39
00:01:53,705 --&gt; 00:01:56,249
one has to remember all this has early
modern roots, just

40
00:01:56,249 --&gt; 00:01:58,570
like we did with the whole Spanish movement
and so on.

41
00:01:59,760 --&gt; 00:02:04,010
So, there's a very important figure
called--it's got various names--but

42
00:02:04,010 --&gt; 00:02:08,370
William Postel, who started out as a
Jesuit in the 16th century,

43
00:02:08,370 --&gt; 00:02:10,490
and then he becomes part of the Catholic

44
00:02:10,490 --&gt; 00:02:11,940
renewal, but in a very radical way.

45
00:02:13,160 --&gt; 00:02:15,560
And he has this connection to this young
woman, Johanna.

46
00:02:16,870 --&gt; 00:02:18,860
And he says she's the new Eve-Eve.

47
00:02:18,860 --&gt; 00:02:23,340
She amends the sins, the primal sin of Eve
in the Bible, just

48
00:02:23,340 --&gt; 00:02:26,250
like Christ amends the sin of Adam which
is explicit in the New Testament.

49
00:02:27,300 --&gt; 00:02:29,200
And, now here this is very interesting
psychoanalytically.

50
00:02:29,200 --&gt; 00:02:30,780
He sees her as a kind of mother figure.

51
00:02:32,052 --&gt; 00:02:33,310
Like, he has a sort of projection on

52
00:02:33,310 --&gt; 00:02:36,180
her, in psychoanalytic terms, as a mother
figure.

53
00:02:36,180 --&gt; 00:02:38,110
And he speaks of her as the mother of the
world.

54
00:02:38,110 --&gt; 00:02:39,750
Which is like the idea of the world's

55
00:02:39,750 --&gt; 00:02:41,830
soul, the anima mundi, as a feminine
figure.

56
00:02:41,830 --&gt; 00:02:45,370
And this is a very Jungian idea that Jung
and his student, who came to

57
00:02:45,370 --&gt; 00:02:47,910
Israel actually, Erich Neumann, speak
about, the great

58
00:02:47,910 --&gt; 00:02:50,430
mother who's also the mother of the world.

59
00:02:50,430 --&gt; 00:02:52,830
The archetype of the anima, of the
eternal

60
00:02:52,830 --&gt; 00:02:56,670
feminine, which has a very complex
relationship with this figure

61
00:02:56,670 --&gt; 00:02:58,970
of the-the world soul, the anima mundi,
and

62
00:02:58,970 --&gt; 00:03:01,340
the-the mother of the world, the great
mother.

63
00:03:02,420 --&gt; 00:03:08,170
Now, just like Jung uses the two
internal figures, the animus and

64
00:03:08,170 --&gt; 00:03:12,690
the anima, of the male and the
female, for him the-this

65
00:03:12,690 --&gt; 00:03:16,060
question of which is more superior and so
on, it's very-I think

66
00:03:16,060 --&gt; 00:03:17,230
this is a important source for

67
00:03:17,230 --&gt; 00:03:19,120
Jungian psychology which has been somewhat
overlooked.

68
00:03:20,580 --&gt; 00:03:22,560
There's actually a book by someone called
Yvonne

69
00:03:22,560 --&gt; 00:03:25,968
Petry who's got a slightly Jungian
interpretation of Postel.

70
00:03:25,968 --&gt; 00:03:27,426
Now, Postel was very influenced

71
00:03:27,426 --&gt; 00:03:28,079
by Kabbalah.

72
00:03:28,079 --&gt; 00:03:31,551
He's got a commentary on Zohar and there's a
very important Ph.D.,

73
00:03:31,551 --&gt; 00:03:33,200
whose writing has just been finished--

74
00:03:34,380 --&gt; 00:03:35,880
I won't say more-more about that because

75
00:03:35,880 --&gt; 00:03:38,375
it's what called&#160;???, it's still
being reviewed--

76
00:03:38,375 --&gt; 00:03:44,415
but part of it has been published in a
book that I co-edited as

77
00:03:44,415 --&gt; 00:03:51,110
well, and by Yehudit Weiss, who's a very
important young scholar of Kabbalah.

78
00:03:51,110 --&gt; 00:03:52,640
And she really did very

79
00:03:52,640 --&gt; 00:03:55,730
important work on this figure, on his
commentary on the great

80
00:03:55,730 --&gt; 00:04:00,280
classic of the Kabbalah, the Zohar, and all his
Kabbalis-the Kabbalistic influence here.

81
00:04:00,280 --&gt; 00:04:03,490
And she even has also written about
this,

82
00:04:03,490 --&gt; 00:04:06,730
and actually, Postel actually spent three
months here in Jerusalem,

83
00:04:06,730 --&gt; 00:04:08,560
so it's not insignificant.

84
00:04:08,560 --&gt; 00:04:11,700
Now one of the reasons why I'm mentioning
all of this, is we see that

85
00:04:11,700 --&gt; 00:04:14,010
from its beginnings, this whole focus on

86
00:04:14,010 --&gt; 00:04:17,430
the feminine principle, on the--which,
afterwards, again,

87
00:04:17,430 --&gt; 00:04:22,700
influenced Jung--the whole focus on--and
Hillman and so on--the whole focus on

88
00:04:22,700 --&gt; 00:04:27,950
the devotion to a feminine figure is
influenced by Kabbalah.

89
00:04:27,950 --&gt; 00:04:32,700
And also in the 17th and 18th century, when
this movement reaches its height, we

90
00:04:32,700 --&gt; 00:04:37,434
have in the circle of Luzzatto--and again,
there's discussion of this on our website--

91
00:04:37,434 --&gt; 00:04:42,564
there's a whole sense of devotion to the
figure of the

92
00:04:42,564 --&gt; 00:04:48,353
sekhina, that's S E K H I N A, I guess.
The sekhina, the

93
00:04:48,353 --&gt; 00:04:54,690
figure of-the feminine figure which dwells,
that's shohem, dwells inside the world.

94
00:04:54,690 --&gt; 00:04:57,030
Again, like this great mother of the world
figure.

95
00:04:57,030 --&gt; 00:04:58,430
We have the same idea of devotion to

96
00:04:58,430 --&gt; 00:05:01,600
this figure in Padua, in north Italy, 18th
century.

97
00:05:03,480 --&gt; 00:05:05,540
So again, we see these connections.

98
00:05:05,540 --&gt; 00:05:06,050
Now,

99
00:05:07,420 --&gt; 00:05:10,510
there's a whole wave, really, of feminine
spirituality. The

100
00:05:10,510 --&gt; 00:05:14,334
Inquisition is somewhat on their case in
north Italy.

101
00:05:14,334 --&gt; 00:05:16,036
They suspect some of these saints, because

102
00:05:16,036 --&gt; 00:05:18,320
they've got some of these anti-nomian
statements.

103
00:05:18,320 --&gt; 00:05:21,250
They're suspicious of people who've got,
like this Anne Lee woman who we spoke

104
00:05:21,250 --&gt; 00:05:24,700
about, who get this internal realization
through

105
00:05:24,700 --&gt; 00:05:27,840
trance and are-are critical of the Church.

106
00:05:27,840 --&gt; 00:05:30,120
There's a whole lot of suspicion towards
this movement

107
00:05:30,120 --&gt; 00:05:32,320
just like there was suspicion towards the
circle of Luzzatto.

108
00:05:32,320 --&gt; 00:05:32,950
It's the same thing.

109
00:05:32,950 --&gt; 00:05:36,570
There's almost an inquisitory process
towards the

110
00:05:36,570 --&gt; 00:05:38,150
circle of Luzzatto in the same area.

111
00:05:38,150 --&gt; 00:05:42,290
And Luzzatto also spoke about the two
messiahs.

112
00:05:43,300 --&gt; 00:05:46,070
The-the messianic principle is dual, but
he

113
00:05:46,070 --&gt; 00:05:47,850
didn't speak about it in so much gender
terms.

114
00:05:47,850 --&gt; 00:05:52,420
And here we've got this idea of two
messiahs, one male figure amending

115
00:05:52,420 --&gt; 00:05:55,310
the sin of Adam and one female figure
amending the sin of Eve.

116
00:05:56,850 --&gt; 00:05:57,190
Now,

117
00:05:57,190 --&gt; 00:05:59,610
just two more things about Anne Lee is
that she spoke

118
00:05:59,610 --&gt; 00:06:03,520
against sex, which is interesting that all
this discourse can somehow lead

119
00:06:03,520 --&gt; 00:06:07,310
to sexual freedom, but it can also lead to
avoiding sex completely,

120
00:06:07,310 --&gt; 00:06:11,770
because one transcends sex, just like one
transcends all other external things.

121
00:06:11,770 --&gt; 00:06:15,460
And she was against marriage, which is
quite radical.

122
00:06:15,460 --&gt; 00:06:17,948
Again, the beginnings of feminism in a
way.

123
00:06:17,948 --&gt; 00:06:20,560
There's a critique of marriage here as
well.

124
00:06:20,560 --&gt; 00:06:22,370
And, and one more thing is

125
00:06:22,370 --&gt; 00:06:24,610
that when, the idea of, that the Shakers

126
00:06:24,610 --&gt; 00:06:27,350
and Quakers have, of going through
cathartic shaking,

127
00:06:27,350 --&gt; 00:06:29,000
when the body begins to shake.

128
00:06:29,000 --&gt; 00:06:33,210
Now this is a manifestation of-of energy
really, which we find in many contexts.

129
00:06:33,210 --&gt; 00:06:36,050
We find it in Japan.
It's called settai or sottai.

130
00:06:36,050 --&gt; 00:06:37,880
We find it in Indonesia.
It's called subud.

131
00:06:37,880 --&gt; 00:06:39,340
We find it in the Hasidic texts.

132
00:06:39,340 --&gt; 00:06:43,380
The idea that the body goes into
involuntary states.

133
00:06:43,380 --&gt; 00:06:48,550
So really, the- the- it's also a sort of
trance phenomenon.

134
00:06:48,550 --&gt; 00:06:54,340
Again this whole cluster of ideas related
to, or manifestations related to, trance,

135
00:06:54,340 --&gt; 00:06:56,320
which is very central for understanding
the

136
00:06:56,320 --&gt; 00:06:59,650
17th century, 18th century, as I said
before.

137
00:07:01,070 --&gt; 00:07:04,010
So this is, the, the last section I want
to speak

138
00:07:04,010 --&gt; 00:07:06,700
about how all this moves to America,
because that's what happened in

139
00:07:06,700 --&gt; 00:07:10,840
the 18th century, the colonization of
America, the establishment of America,

140
00:07:10,840 --&gt; 00:07:14,480
the New World, which already begins with
Columbus in the 16th century.

141
00:07:14,480 --&gt; 00:07:17,620
And all this, of course, of course there
was also the native tradition,

142
00:07:17,620 --&gt; 00:07:19,160
which is a shamanic tradition, which was

143
00:07:20,370 --&gt; 00:07:22,790
almost eradicated by the settlers, the
colonists.

144
00:07:24,510 --&gt; 00:07:28,008
And, really, 18th or 19th century America
begins to
