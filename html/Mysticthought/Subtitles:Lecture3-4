1
00:00:00,580 --&gt; 00:00:05,720
Now, let's go back, almost passage by
passage, over the text

2
00:00:05,720 --&gt; 00:00:08,050
and we'll, we'll put a few of these ideas
in context.

3
00:00:08,050 --&gt; 00:00:10,790
We can't exaust this text, it's a rich
text, but just

4
00:00:10,790 --&gt; 00:00:13,610
to show, to demonstrate the method of
place and text in context.

5
00:00:14,660 --&gt; 00:00:20,130
So first of all, there's a very strong
concern here of will, with free will.

6
00:00:20,130 --&gt; 00:00:21,320
And this is of course related to a

7
00:00:21,320 --&gt; 00:00:24,628
very modern concern with will, for problem
of will.

8
00:00:24,628 --&gt; 00:00:25,800
Do we really

9
00:00:25,800 --&gt; 00:00:26,860
have free will?

10
00:00:26,860 --&gt; 00:00:28,760
Are we controlled by the unconscious,
Freud?

11
00:00:28,760 --&gt; 00:00:33,640
Are we controlled by social forces, Marx?
Are we controlled by evolution, Darwin?

12
00:00:33,640 --&gt; 00:00:35,800
It's a very 19th century issue, very much

13
00:00:35,800 --&gt; 00:00:39,110
developed in Schopenhauer, Nietzsche,
other writers who focused on

14
00:00:39,110 --&gt; 00:00:43,500
will after the existentialism,
existentialist psychology reaching into

15
00:00:43,500 --&gt; 00:00:46,380
the 20th century all the way to Rollo May.

16
00:00:46,380 --&gt; 00:00:48,800
That's R-O-L-L-O M-A-Y.

17
00:00:48,800 --&gt; 00:00:52,080
Writes, a great writer of existentialist
psychology.

18
00:00:53,240 --&gt; 00:00:56,090
So one key word here is the question of
will.

19
00:00:57,210 --&gt; 00:01:00,470
Then we have the whole question of
unconscious.

20
00:01:00,470 --&gt; 00:01:03,720
There are deeper hidden forces, this is
very clearly in the text.

21
00:01:03,720 --&gt; 00:01:06,493
Now it's well known, in the books about
this, that the

22
00:01:06,493 --&gt; 00:01:10,911
unconscious, the view of unconscious of
course, unconscious mind proceeds Freud.

23
00:01:10,911 --&gt; 00:01:12,490
It's in Schopenhauer.

24
00:01:12,490 --&gt; 00:01:16,370
It's in other sources in 19th century
German philosophy.

25
00:01:17,370 --&gt; 00:01:18,330
And it's also

26
00:01:18,330 --&gt; 00:01:20,320
found in Kabbala, perhaps by the founder

27
00:01:20,320 --&gt; 00:01:26,366
of Mussar led by Israel Salanter,
S-A-L-A-N-T-E-R.

28
00:01:26,366 --&gt; 00:01:30,150
Lipkin, his family name was, who's student
of a

29
00:01:30,150 --&gt; 00:01:33,240
student of a student of the, of
[INAUDIBLE] Vilna.

30
00:01:33,240 --&gt; 00:01:35,440
Maybe he also developed the idea of
unconscious,

31
00:01:35,440 --&gt; 00:01:37,590
what he calls dark, [FOREIGN] in German,
dark

32
00:01:37,590 --&gt; 00:01:40,820
forces and light forces, forces of
darkness and

33
00:01:40,820 --&gt; 00:01:44,880
light inside the psyche, working of
unconscious mind.

34
00:01:44,880 --&gt; 00:01:47,328
There are all kinds of possibilities, but
certainly the

35
00:01:47,328 --&gt; 00:01:50,428
unconscious preceded Freud and Rabbi Kook
is writing of unconscious.

36
00:01:50,428 --&gt; 00:01:52,590
There are also Hasidic writings in a

37
00:01:52,590 --&gt; 00:01:55,290
second generation of Hasidism about the
unconscious.

38
00:01:55,290 --&gt; 00:01:59,910
Gershom Scholem was also one of these
early, great early 20th century figures.

39
00:01:59,910 --&gt; 00:02:01,773
He also wrote about it.

40
00:02:01,773 --&gt; 00:02:06,812
So the second thing to focus on here, to
underline here really, is the unconscious.

41
00:02:06,812 --&gt; 00:02:09,972
Now the idea of freedom, again, we spoke
about

42
00:02:09,972 --&gt; 00:02:14,396
freedom as whole, what's called left wing
Freudianism, a whole

43
00:02:14,396 --&gt; 00:02:18,741
development of Freud by thinkers such as
Robert Brown and Herbert

44
00:02:18,741 --&gt; 00:02:22,375
Marcuse, M-A-R-C-U-S-E and others, what's

45
00:02:22,375 --&gt; 00:02:26,562
called emancipatory psychoanalysis, see
psychoanalysis as

46
00:02:26,562 --&gt; 00:02:31,210
a force for freedom, social freedom and so
on, political freedom.

47
00:02:32,540 --&gt; 00:02:35,020
The idea of cosmology, I spoke about a
lot.

48
00:02:35,020 --&gt; 00:02:41,310
Important book just released now by
Phillip Wexler, W-E-X-L-E-R.

49
00:02:41,310 --&gt; 00:02:45,510
Mystical sociology towards cosmic social
theory, the whole idea that

50
00:02:45,510 --&gt; 00:02:48,800
the cosmos becomes a very strong part of
this discourse.

51
00:02:48,800 --&gt; 00:02:52,070
Together with the development as I said,
another great Jewish figure of early

52
00:02:52,070 --&gt; 00:02:55,310
20th century Einstein, who was also
involved

53
00:02:55,310 --&gt; 00:02:56,970
with the Hebrew University by the way.

54
00:02:56,970 --&gt; 00:03:00,270
And Einstein responded to Zionism.
So Einstein

55
00:03:00,270 --&gt; 00:03:03,980
also was working on Cosmology on time and
space and

56
00:03:03,980 --&gt; 00:03:07,220
here we have a different direction about
time and space.

57
00:03:07,220 --&gt; 00:03:09,570
Like these other thinkers, Aurobindo, de
Chardin

58
00:03:09,570 --&gt; 00:03:13,130
and others, were working on a mystical
cosmology.

59
00:03:13,130 --&gt; 00:03:15,550
And William James was, as Wexler points
out, was

60
00:03:15,550 --&gt; 00:03:20,070
also thinking about these issues of
psyche, cosmology, mysticism.

61
00:03:20,070 --&gt; 00:03:22,090
There's a newer sense of a cosmos, not
just of

62
00:03:22,090 --&gt; 00:03:25,380
the world, but science is opening up at
this period a

63
00:03:25,380 --&gt; 00:03:27,910
new picture of a cosmos, a new world
picture.

64
00:03:28,980 --&gt; 00:03:31,670
And Rabbi Kook is saying, yes it's all
very well.

65
00:03:31,670 --&gt; 00:03:33,350
But we need also divine science.

66
00:03:33,350 --&gt; 00:03:35,640
We need to see how this ties into
religion.

67
00:03:35,640 --&gt; 00:03:40,240
So cosmology is again, I would say a
fourth major theme here.

68
00:03:40,240 --&gt; 00:03:42,920
I mentioned justice is not a major theme.

69
00:03:42,920 --&gt; 00:03:46,350
I mentioned the theme of a depth, of depth
psychology, going deeper.

70
00:03:47,600 --&gt; 00:03:50,660
Very strongly developed afterwards by
people like James Hillman, and

71
00:03:50,660 --&gt; 00:03:51,860
Wolfgang Giegerich.

72
00:03:51,860 --&gt; 00:03:55,470
The whole idea of psychology is really,

73
00:03:55,470 --&gt; 00:03:58,470
depth psychology has to go much deeper,
move

74
00:03:58,470 --&gt; 00:04:03,550
beyond the, the ego that Freud spoke about
into much deeper forces inside the psyche.

75
00:04:03,550 --&gt; 00:04:05,110
And Rabbi Kook certainly shares this
vision.

76
00:04:06,900 --&gt; 00:04:09,890
Morality, another term here, he speaks
about morality.

77
00:04:09,890 --&gt; 00:04:12,010
We spoke about Nietzsche, beyond good and
evil.

78
00:04:14,330 --&gt; 00:04:17,690
life, vitality, that's another key phrase,
idea here.

79
00:04:18,700 --&gt; 00:04:22,700
That he speaks about life, about the
essence of life.

80
00:04:22,700 --&gt; 00:04:24,960
There's a psychology of vitality.

81
00:04:24,960 --&gt; 00:04:27,130
National vitality as we spoke about,
individual

82
00:04:27,130 --&gt; 00:04:30,790
vitality, it's part of this positive
psychology.

83
00:04:30,790 --&gt; 00:04:34,350
And a lot of people who write about life
force about energy

84
00:04:34,350 --&gt; 00:04:39,440
and Henri Bergson, also in France, Rabbi
Kook was certainly influenced by him.

85
00:04:39,440 --&gt; 00:04:41,250
Nietzsche, of course, his whole
affirmation of

86
00:04:41,250 --&gt; 00:04:43,620
life against morality at sometime, at some
points.

87
00:04:45,490 --&gt; 00:04:48,800
This is a very strong theme of
existentialist psychology.

88
00:04:48,800 --&gt; 00:04:52,540
And Freud also speaks about Libido, Eros,
the forces of, of

89
00:04:52,540 --&gt; 00:04:56,980
vitality, of sexual vitality, of psychic
energy one could call it.

90
00:04:56,980 --&gt; 00:04:59,880
Jung speaks about it, he takes it beyond
the sexual.

91
00:04:59,880 --&gt; 00:05:04,670
He speaks about it also as cosmic force,
as a mythic force.

92
00:05:04,670 --&gt; 00:05:06,610
And, this is a very strong theme of Rabbi
Kook.

93
00:05:06,610 --&gt; 00:05:09,190
We, we, he's got a poem.

94
00:05:09,190 --&gt; 00:05:11,170
Whisper to me the secret of the whole of
existence.

95
00:05:12,510 --&gt; 00:05:14,830
I have life, take from me.

96
00:05:14,830 --&gt; 00:05:17,710
So the secret of the whole of existence is
life.

97
00:05:17,710 --&gt; 00:05:22,200
And he speaks of the new generation that
will rise in the land of Israel.

98
00:05:22,200 --&gt; 00:05:23,500
We will have much more vitality,

99
00:05:23,500 --&gt; 00:05:26,979
physical vitality and psychological,
national, political vitality.

100
00:05:28,230 --&gt; 00:05:30,192
And other people also spoke about it.
Actually

101
00:05:30,192 --&gt; 00:05:34,539
Marx, evidence often pointed out by
neo-Marxist thinking is, Marx also

102
00:05:34,539 --&gt; 00:05:39,140
spoke about vitality, about social energy
as it's expressed in labor.

103
00:05:39,140 --&gt; 00:05:40,610
How it can be alienated.

104
00:05:40,610 --&gt; 00:05:42,150
How it can become fetishes.

105
00:05:42,150 --&gt; 00:05:45,710
When people get, the whole vitality gets
trapped into working

106
00:05:45,710 --&gt; 00:05:48,260
in order to buy more products, to buy more
machines.

107
00:05:48,260 --&gt; 00:05:50,460
This is also part of the spirit of the
times.

108
00:05:50,460 --&gt; 00:05:52,450
And on the right wing, we were also, not
just on

109
00:05:52,450 --&gt; 00:05:55,440
the left wing, but also thinkers that
afterwards lead into Nazism even.

110
00:05:55,440 --&gt; 00:05:58,220
People like Heidiger were also speaking in
this way

111
00:05:58,220 --&gt; 00:06:00,900
in a nationalist direction, about how to
keep these

112
00:06:00,900 --&gt; 00:06:06,170
forces of vitality, of national vitality,
from being eroded

113
00:06:06,170 --&gt; 00:06:09,900
by technology, eroded by the pressures of
modern society.

114
00:06:09,900 --&gt; 00:06:13,290
So this is a very constant theme in the
early 20th century in literature.

115
00:06:13,290 --&gt; 00:06:17,770
If we think, think of people like James
Joyce and afterwards DH Lawrence.

116
00:06:17,770 --&gt; 00:06:20,910
We're speaking about D.H. Lawrence, so
we're speaking about a

117
00:06:20,910 --&gt; 00:06:24,000
lot of literary concern with this issue of

118
00:06:24,000 --&gt; 00:06:29,220
vitality, of sexual vitality, of
psychological vitality, physical vitality.

119
00:06:29,220 --&gt; 00:06:32,280
And one must remember that they were very,
today it's this whole

120
00:06:32,280 --&gt; 00:06:36,100
thing of working out, of gymnastics and so
on, is very self evident.

121
00:06:36,100 --&gt; 00:06:40,920
However, Rabbi Kook was criticized for
writing that the, exercise,

122
00:06:40,920 --&gt; 00:06:45,960
physical exercises that young people do
has a great kabbalistic cosmic

123
00:06:45,960 --&gt; 00:06:50,700
effect, even if it involves doing it on
the Sabbath or things like that.

124
00:06:50,700 --&gt; 00:06:55,530
Which are not exactly according to Jewish
Law, even though one can argue about that.

125
00:06:55,530 --&gt; 00:07:00,700
And so this whole internationalist
movements of the early 20th century.

126
00:07:00,700 --&gt; 00:07:04,800
And youth movements that were in the
1920's in Germany and elsewhere.

127
00:07:04,800 --&gt; 00:07:08,950
The whole movement of the scouts, which
came into it's own at this time.

128
00:07:08,950 --&gt; 00:07:11,150
The Boy Scots, this is all part of a very

129
00:07:11,150 --&gt; 00:07:13,740
strong emphasis on the physical, on
gymnastics,

130
00:07:13,740 --&gt; 00:07:15,900
on developing the body, making the body
stronger.

131
00:07:15,900 --&gt; 00:07:18,070
Nietzsche writes about this a lot.

132
00:07:18,070 --&gt; 00:07:20,110
So again one has to see all this in
historical context.

133
00:07:21,170 --&gt; 00:07:21,670
So

134
00:07:24,280 --&gt; 00:07:27,080
the question is of course, the nation.

135
00:07:27,080 --&gt; 00:07:29,840
He says this is, this flag is borne by the
Jewish nation.

136
00:07:29,840 --&gt; 00:07:32,310
Of course it's all national psychology.

137
00:07:32,310 --&gt; 00:07:34,340
And of course Nietzsche also turned into
nationalism.

138
00:07:34,340 --&gt; 00:07:37,410
It's a question of how much is Nietzsche
itself, and how much is his

139
00:07:37,410 --&gt; 00:07:40,630
sister who again censored, edited his
writings,

140
00:07:40,630 --&gt; 00:07:42,230
and then it lead, led even to Nazism.

141
00:07:43,340 --&gt; 00:07:46,000
However, when we, I'll speak soon about
the circle of

142
00:07:46,000 --&gt; 00:07:49,410
Rabbi Kook, we'll see how strong this
national psychology becomes.

143
00:07:49,410 --&gt; 00:07:51,830
And I think Rabbi Kook also, it's very
national.

144
00:07:51,830 --&gt; 00:07:53,870
There is a cosmic message, there is a

145
00:07:53,870 --&gt; 00:07:56,114
universal message, but it's also very
strongly national.
