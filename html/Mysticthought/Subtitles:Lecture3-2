00:00:00,420 --&gt; 00:00:03,250
Now I want to speak before going in to the
text and today we really going to

2
00:00:03,250 --&gt; 00:00:06,280
exemplify, the main method that I usually
teach in,

3
00:00:06,280 --&gt; 00:00:08,920
which is to read a text and analyse it.

4
00:00:08,920 --&gt; 00:00:10,010
We'll only do it once.

5
00:00:10,010 --&gt; 00:00:13,480
We'll sort of get a taste, couple of times
we'll speak about the text more generally.

6
00:00:13,480 --&gt; 00:00:16,760
But this is the only opportunity really to
show,

7
00:00:16,760 --&gt; 00:00:20,439
demonstrate the method of close reading of
the text.

8
00:00:20,439 --&gt; 00:00:20,939
.

9
00:00:22,300 --&gt; 00:00:25,690
Now before getting to the text, I want to
give a bit more introductory material

10
00:00:25,690 --&gt; 00:00:32,420
on Rabbi Kook that the focus

11
00:00:32,420 --&gt; 00:00:36,760
of Rabbi Kook in psychological terms is
what is today called positive psychology.

12
00:00:37,980 --&gt; 00:00:39,980
Now, positive psychology is, of course,
very

13
00:00:39,980 --&gt; 00:00:43,050
fashionable today but it is a whole
history.

14
00:00:43,050 --&gt; 00:00:45,580
And we get into Orthodox mysticism.

15
00:00:45,580 --&gt; 00:00:47,960
Next lesson, we'll talk about this more.

16
00:00:47,960 --&gt; 00:00:50,733
But what I want to say for now is, if we
go back to William James,

17
00:00:50,733 --&gt; 00:00:51,690
this is a guy who is of

18
00:00:51,690 --&gt; 00:00:54,720
religious experience and generally, his
psychological writing.

19
00:00:55,770 --&gt; 00:00:58,040
Partly based on mystical experiences of
his own.

20
00:00:58,040 --&gt; 00:00:59,960
This is something which has come out in
recent scholarship.

21
00:01:00,960 --&gt; 00:01:05,280
William James speaks of what's called,
healthy-minded psychology.

22
00:01:05,280 --&gt; 00:01:08,420
Now healthy minded is basically what we
call today positive psychology.

23
00:01:10,140 --&gt; 00:01:15,270
And Rabbi Kook undoubtedly is in the
school of positive psychology.

24
00:01:16,360 --&gt; 00:01:19,140
Now this itself was a bit of a debate
between Freud and Jung.

25
00:01:19,140 --&gt; 00:01:24,630
Because Freud has a more pessimistic view
of the human psyche and potential.

26
00:01:24,630 --&gt; 00:01:26,120
That's why he writes that the whole goal
of

27
00:01:26,120 --&gt; 00:01:31,240
psychoanalysis is to move from hysterical
suffering to common unhappiness.

28
00:01:31,240 --&gt; 00:01:34,240
Now, that's, that's the best we can hope
for.

29
00:01:34,240 --&gt; 00:01:36,730
Because this movie, as good as it gets.

30
00:01:36,730 --&gt; 00:01:40,640
So I think that this more or less one,
what one can hope for.

31
00:01:40,640 --&gt; 00:01:41,620
This, it's as good

32
00:01:41,620 --&gt; 00:01:44,080
as it gets to get to common unhappiness
for Freud.

33
00:01:44,080 --&gt; 00:01:46,940
Now, you won't get a more positive
direction effort one can get into

34
00:01:46,940 --&gt; 00:01:52,920
a much deeper integration and really
discover oneself on a much deeper level.

35
00:01:52,920 --&gt; 00:01:56,110
And but he himself also a very strong
pessimistic streak

36
00:01:56,110 --&gt; 00:01:57,910
when he was writing and this got him to
some

37
00:01:57,910 --&gt; 00:02:01,190
political trouble which I won't go into so
much but

38
00:02:01,190 --&gt; 00:02:04,180
he on the one hand he sees the eruption
of.

39
00:02:05,190 --&gt; 00:02:06,942
The national psyche, the collective

40
00:02:06,942 --&gt; 00:02:09,505
psyche, again it's not exactly national
but for more of a collective

41
00:02:09,505 --&gt; 00:02:13,240
psyche, a bit like Rabbi Kook's thinking,
in the first World War.

42
00:02:13,240 --&gt; 00:02:16,430
He has visions of a first World War, of
seas of blood and

43
00:02:16,430 --&gt; 00:02:19,810
sun, and he, and on the one hand, again
that's got him into trouble.

44
00:02:19,810 --&gt; 00:02:23,270
He sees this national awakening in
positive terms.

45
00:02:23,270 --&gt; 00:02:26,960
But he also sees it, its potential for
destructiveness.

46
00:02:26,960 --&gt; 00:02:29,350
Now Rabbi Kook, because he dies before the
Second

47
00:02:29,350 --&gt; 00:02:32,040
World War, and despite the fact that he
writes

48
00:02:32,040 --&gt; 00:02:34,210
in the 30s, with the rise of the Nazis
towards the end of

49
00:02:34,210 --&gt; 00:02:36,370
his life, where perhaps there are
potentials

50
00:02:36,370 --&gt; 00:02:38,470
for evil that we've not yet seen.

51
00:02:38,470 --&gt; 00:02:42,990
Generally his approach, even to events
like the First World War, is positive.

52
00:02:42,990 --&gt; 00:02:45,590
It's all part of a great cosmic scheme.

53
00:02:45,590 --&gt; 00:02:48,600
Of, the restoration of the Jewish people,
which

54
00:02:48,600 --&gt; 00:02:50,720
is not only a national event but a cosmic

55
00:02:50,720 --&gt; 00:02:53,970
event because the Jewish people is really
charged with

56
00:02:53,970 --&gt; 00:02:57,350
filling the vision, of a nation devoted to
God's,

57
00:02:57,350 --&gt; 00:03:00,020
of an, a religious national psyche to the
world.

58
00:03:01,050 --&gt; 00:03:05,220
And here's Israel, in the first world war,
as a civilization in decline.

59
00:03:05,220 --&gt; 00:03:07,190
And perhaps he sees that the Jewish
civilization

60
00:03:07,190 --&gt; 00:03:09,930
will come with some restorative message to
the world.

61
00:03:09,930 --&gt; 00:03:11,370
It's not only a nationalist message.

62
00:03:11,370 --&gt; 00:03:14,358
Of course, it's nationalist, but we also
use universalist elements.

63
00:03:14,358 --&gt; 00:03:20,890
Now, Rabbi Kook, his focus when he speaks
about the individual.

64
00:03:20,890 --&gt; 00:03:22,360
I want to move back to the individual for

65
00:03:22,360 --&gt; 00:03:24,240
a minute, because although he's a national

66
00:03:24,240 --&gt; 00:03:26,370
psychologist, he does not neglect the
individual.

67
00:03:27,730 --&gt; 00:03:29,840
And, in recent years actually, we have

68
00:03:29,840 --&gt; 00:03:32,760
more about his own individual mystical
work.

69
00:03:32,760 --&gt; 00:03:36,040
And his views of how individuals should
work, because

70
00:03:36,040 --&gt; 00:03:38,120
his students his school that I will speak
about

71
00:03:38,120 --&gt; 00:03:43,490
soon they published more the nationalist
elements, the collective

72
00:03:43,490 --&gt; 00:03:46,810
elements of his writing and sometimes even
sensor these texts.

73
00:03:46,810 --&gt; 00:03:47,910
So sometimes Rabbi Kook

74
00:03:47,910 --&gt; 00:03:51,030
says I see, he describes his vision and we
change it

75
00:03:51,030 --&gt; 00:03:53,950
to we see as it is some kind of national
experience.

76
00:03:53,950 --&gt; 00:03:57,150
Collective experience, group experience
maybe.

77
00:03:57,150 --&gt; 00:04:00,540
Sir Rabbi Kook has diaries, some of these
from this period

78
00:04:00,540 --&gt; 00:04:05,110
we've speaking about, the first World War
bit before, bit after, that

79
00:04:05,110 --&gt; 00:04:08,070
we sense it and some of them completely
hidden, and these, it's

80
00:04:08,070 --&gt; 00:04:11,540
a very exciting event that we has been
published in recent years.

81
00:04:12,800 --&gt; 00:04:15,790
And, in these diaries Rabbi Kook speaks
much more about

82
00:04:15,790 --&gt; 00:04:20,580
his personal experience and how he thinks
people should work individually.

83
00:04:20,580 --&gt; 00:04:25,020
And remember in this pre-Palestinian
period, before coming to

84
00:04:25,020 --&gt; 00:04:29,460
Israel, he has a whole more [UNKNOWN] more
individualistic period.

85
00:04:29,460 --&gt; 00:04:33,530
In Europe Now Rabbi Kook.

86
00:04:33,530 --&gt; 00:04:39,140
When he speaks about the individual, he
emphasises

87
00:04:39,140 --&gt; 00:04:41,950
the issue of self-confidence that I
mentioned before.

88
00:04:41,950 --&gt; 00:04:43,940
But he's, he focuses on the individual

89
00:04:43,940 --&gt; 00:04:48,260
developing a much greater sense of
self-confidence.

90
00:04:48,260 --&gt; 00:04:51,540
A much greater sense of self-reliance.

91
00:04:51,540 --&gt; 00:04:54,460
Which is a term which was used in American
psychology by

92
00:04:54,460 --&gt; 00:04:58,380
people like Thoreau, Emerson at the end of
the 19th Century.

93
00:04:58,380 --&gt; 00:05:02,990
And, he speaks about people trusting
themselves.

94
00:05:02,990 --&gt; 00:05:04,020
Now, this,

95
00:05:04,020 --&gt; 00:05:09,380
which for us is part of our positive
psychology, I guess, this is not at all.

96
00:05:09,380 --&gt; 00:05:11,360
To be taken for granted, because the
Mussar

97
00:05:11,360 --&gt; 00:05:15,500
movement, in a somewhat Freudian manner,
emphasized this trust.

98
00:05:15,500 --&gt; 00:05:19,240
They say one must search for one's hidden
motives, that behind every good

99
00:05:19,240 --&gt; 00:05:25,450
deed there could be lurking a, a less
noble desire or, or interest.

100
00:05:26,750 --&gt; 00:05:29,110
And the whole Marxist approach, of course,
is also to look

101
00:05:29,110 --&gt; 00:05:31,360
for the class interests that

102
00:05:31,360 --&gt; 00:05:34,940
Lie behind seemingly positive altruistic
developments.

103
00:05:34,940 --&gt; 00:05:39,630
And generally, in Rabbi Kook's thought, he
moves away from this distrust.

104
00:05:39,630 --&gt; 00:05:41,260
And this is very important in a religious

105
00:05:41,260 --&gt; 00:05:45,536
culture that teaches to be subservient to
religious authority,

106
00:05:45,536 --&gt; 00:05:48,780
to accept the tradition, to accept the
authority

107
00:05:48,780 --&gt; 00:05:51,076
of our ancestors, or the rabbis, or the
texts.

108
00:05:51,076 --&gt; 00:05:54,000
And Rabbi Kook [UNKNOWN] want us to break
beyond this.

109
00:05:54,000 --&gt; 00:05:56,200
One has to have trust in one's own soul.

110
00:05:56,200 --&gt; 00:05:57,510
One has to have trust in the soul of

111
00:05:57,510 --&gt; 00:06:00,070
the young people at the time of national
revival.

112
00:06:00,070 --&gt; 00:06:03,830
But even though they circulate in some
level, a deep unconscious level.

113
00:06:03,830 --&gt; 00:06:07,310
And we'll speak soon about the
unconscious, we know what they are doing.

114
00:06:07,310 --&gt; 00:06:09,120
And they're part of the great scheme that

115
00:06:09,120 --&gt; 00:06:12,100
God is really communicating with us
through the souls.

116
00:06:12,100 --&gt; 00:06:15,350
And therefore the collections which have
appeared recently in Hebu, I

117
00:06:15,350 --&gt; 00:06:19,180
won't trouble you for the graphical
details, that really it's very powerful

118
00:06:19,180 --&gt; 00:06:22,440
when you put together all of Rabbi Kook's
guidance on self-confidence.

119
00:06:22,440 --&gt; 00:06:25,790
It comes out very strong, there's a very
strong message for people should

120
00:06:25,790 --&gt; 00:06:30,820
trust their lives, should trust the course
of their lives, should trust themselves.

121
00:06:30,820 --&gt; 00:06:31,320
Now.

122
00:06:32,630 --&gt; 00:06:36,030
This is when we move to the national
level, this related to

123
00:06:36,030 --&gt; 00:06:39,670
how he has a po, a positive view of a
secular world.

124
00:06:39,670 --&gt; 00:06:43,150
A positive view of nationalism.
A positive view of Zionism.

125
00:06:43,150 --&gt; 00:06:44,360
And of other movements.
Of

126
00:06:44,360 --&gt; 00:06:44,990
Socialism.

127
00:06:46,140 --&gt; 00:06:50,160
For Rabbi Kook, in a passage written in
this period that we're speaking about.

128
00:06:50,160 --&gt; 00:06:52,010
He speaks about the fact that just like
there are

129
00:06:52,010 --&gt; 00:06:56,150
different forces in the psyche and one has
to integrate them.

130
00:06:56,150 --&gt; 00:06:58,220
And we see in his diaries that his own
mystical

131
00:06:58,220 --&gt; 00:07:03,862
practice was about integrating the various
forces inside his own psyche.

132
00:07:03,862 --&gt; 00:07:07,760
Kook also of the national level the
various forces of the nation.

133
00:07:07,760 --&gt; 00:07:09,340
There's a socialist force.

134
00:07:09,340 --&gt; 00:07:12,010
There's a nationalist force.
There's a liberal force.

135
00:07:12,010 --&gt; 00:07:13,580
There's a religious force.

136
00:07:13,580 --&gt; 00:07:16,620
All of these forces, none of them
represents the absolute truth.

137
00:07:16,620 --&gt; 00:07:19,660
This is a very relativist, in some way
post-modern way of thinking.

138
00:07:20,660 --&gt; 00:07:24,770
That's even of, for my point of view
relativism is deep in modernity.

139
00:07:24,770 --&gt; 00:07:28,320
It's deep in the Romantic movement of the
18th, 19th, 20th century.

140
00:07:28,320 --&gt; 00:07:29,670
It's deep into existentialism.

141
00:07:29,670 --&gt; 00:07:34,610
It didn't wait for post-modernism.
And so we have this relativist

142
00:07:34,610 --&gt; 00:07:39,240
approach, which Rabbi Kook is thinking
about the various forces that he

143
00:07:39,240 --&gt; 00:07:41,130
himself in his own mystical practice

144
00:07:41,130 --&gt; 00:07:45,190
integrates for, what he calls
unifications, Yihudim.

145
00:07:45,190 --&gt; 00:07:47,980
That's Yihudim.

146
00:07:47,980 --&gt; 00:07:49,380
A Hebrew word.

147
00:07:49,380 --&gt; 00:07:51,060
Inside oneself.

148
00:07:51,060 --&gt; 00:07:53,320
And, through these unifications, the
nation

149
00:07:53,320 --&gt; 00:07:55,430
itself can begin to integrate itself.

150
00:07:55,430 --&gt; 00:07:57,640
A bit like the Yihudim idea of
individuation,

151
00:07:57,640 --&gt; 00:08:00,000
if you take these different forces, these
different

152
00:08:00,000 --&gt; 00:08:03,280
collective archetypes in the psyche and
find some kind

153
00:08:03,280 --&gt; 00:08:06,490
of integrated self, so same thing for
Rabbi Kook.

154
00:08:06,490 --&gt; 00:08:08,420
When asked to integrate the different
forces of

155
00:08:08,420 --&gt; 00:08:11,080
vitalities that are now reviving in the
nation.

156
00:08:11,080 --&gt; 00:08:15,960
And not to see as contradictory, but to
see them, as actually working together.

157
00:08:15,960 --&gt; 00:08:19,300
With all the crisis that this creates in,

158
00:08:19,300 --&gt; 00:08:22,900
in, in a greater movement towards
evolution, towards good.

159
00:08:22,900 --&gt; 00:08:25,140
Now, there's one final point I want to say
before

160
00:08:25,140 --&gt; 00:08:27,210
getting on to the text, and this is
something really amazing.

161
00:08:28,210 --&gt; 00:08:31,660
And, I think, only through somebody like,
well like

162
00:08:31,660 --&gt; 00:08:34,500
Jeff Kriples can being to understand a
phenomenon like this.

163
00:08:37,050 --&gt; 00:08:41,350
That Rabbi Kook was operating the same
time as a great Indian

164
00:08:41,350 --&gt; 00:08:46,610
mystic, one of the greatest modern Indian
mystics, Sri Aurobindo in India.

165
00:08:46,610 --&gt; 00:08:48,600
And Aurobindo is has a similar trajectory

166
00:08:48,600 --&gt; 00:08:52,330
to Rabbi Kook, very very similar,
amazingly similar.

167
00:08:52,330 --&gt; 00:08:55,780
Nationalist activity, together with
intense mystical life.

168
00:08:55,780 --&gt; 00:08:59,980
These personal intensely mystical diaries
that were then censored

169
00:08:59,980 --&gt; 00:09:02,390
by his followers and have been revealed in
recent years

170
00:09:02,390 --&gt; 00:09:03,930
by Peter Hayes.

171
00:09:03,930 --&gt; 00:09:06,850
And poetic activity just like a Rabbi

172
00:09:06,850 --&gt; 00:09:09,570
Kook, a great believe in literature, in
poetry.

173
00:09:09,570 --&gt; 00:09:11,430
Many, many parallels.

174
00:09:11,430 --&gt; 00:09:14,050
And he has, in common with Rabbi Kook,
this belief

175
00:09:14,050 --&gt; 00:09:18,100
in cosmic evolution, that humanity is
moving towards super humanity.

176
00:09:18,100 --&gt; 00:09:20,620
There were a few people working on this at
the time.

177
00:09:20,620 --&gt; 00:09:22,530
And Jeff Kripal has written about this.

178
00:09:22,530 --&gt; 00:09:27,450
Frederic Myers, that's Myers, and others,
who were working on

179
00:09:27,450 --&gt; 00:09:30,270
this idea that humanity is moving to a new
phase.

180
00:09:30,270 --&gt; 00:09:32,990
Moving to a new positive phase, a more
integrated phase.

181
00:09:32,990 --&gt; 00:09:35,920
Of realization of hidden powers of the
body, of the

182
00:09:35,920 --&gt; 00:09:39,570
soul, of the psyche, of the collective
psyche, of individual psyche.

183
00:09:39,570 --&gt; 00:09:41,140
And there's a third person working in
exactly

184
00:09:41,140 --&gt; 00:09:44,310
the same direction, Teilhard de Chardin in
Paris.

185
00:09:44,310 --&gt; 00:09:46,860
A Catholic Priest who was, got into some
trouble

186
00:09:46,860 --&gt; 00:09:49,800
with church because of his radical ideas
of his.

187
00:09:49,800 --&gt; 00:09:52,160
And it's amazing that free people in
different cultures.

188
00:09:52,160 --&gt; 00:09:52,720
In India,

189
00:09:52,720 --&gt; 00:09:55,790
in France.
And in the land of Israel, Palestine.

190
00:09:55,790 --&gt; 00:09:58,740
Are working in a similar direction in a
similar period.

191
00:09:58,740 --&gt; 00:10:01,480
Highly unlikely there was any contact at
all between them.

192
00:10:01,480 --&gt; 00:10:04,040
And neverthele, nonetheless, responding to
the same

193
00:10:04,040 --&gt; 00:10:08,990
historical events, and formulating very
similar responses.

194
00:10:08,990 --&gt; 00:10:10,100
What does this mean?

195
00:10:10,100 --&gt; 00:10:12,640
What does this mean in terms of the
collective psyche,

196
00:10:12,640 --&gt; 00:10:16,530
as Jung put it, collect, the spirit of the
time, Zeitgeist?

197
00:10:16,530 --&gt; 00:10:17,810
What does this mean in

198
00:10:17,810 --&gt; 00:10:22,910
terms of the possibility that perhaps as
Giegerich put it, the soul

199
00:10:22,910 --&gt; 00:10:24,780
is also historical, it works through

200
00:10:24,780 --&gt; 00:10:27,460
history, it expresses itself through
history.

201
00:10:27,460 --&gt; 00:10:29,460
These are quesitons that we leave open for
now.
