<p>I found an link to some interesting reading about Rav Kook&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.vbm-torah.org/igrot.html">http://www.vbm-torah.org/igrot.html</a>
</p>
I was trying to find out more about his letter #555, or Igeret 555 (1913&#160;?) - Rabbi Kook's letter delineating the 2 basic elements that make up the holiness of Israel - the inner Divine essence (segulah) and our free will which facilitates the expression of that essence</p>
<p>I missed the deadline again - my program kept saying I had three days still to submit Assignment 2, but when I went to upload it, it said no. I must've been in a trance. Better luck next week. Here is my effort anyway.</p>
<p>The main social developments that occurred in the 2nd wave of Kabbalah (the Safedian Kabbalah) during the 16th century include the Renaissance (which saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, but which is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo), the “discovery” of America, the movement of Jews eastward from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1497) from where they were expelled., the emergence of Kabbalah itself as a social movement, and the development of Kabbalistic social psychology, which included the concept of reincarnation. </p>
<p>The third ‘big’ wave of the Kabbalah (which included the “conservative” Hasidic movement) began in the 18th century. Social developments from this time include the American and French Revolutions, the Feminist and Industrial Revolutions, the development of coffee houses, newspapers. This was also the time of the Age of Enlightenment (or the Age of Reason) which was a cultural movement of intellectuals beginning in late 17th and 18th century Europe emphasizing reason and individualism rather than tradition. The purpose of this movement was to reform society using reason, to challenge ideas grounded in tradition and faith, and to advance knowledge through the scientific method. It promoted scientific thought, scepticism, and intellectual interchange, and opposed superstition and intolerance, including that espoused by Catholicism.Trance is a key vehicle used by Shamans. Hasidic leaders (the Tzaddick) acting as Shaman, draw followers into their own trance, so as to provide advice and healing. Trance is also used by psychologists such as Jung, and Erickson. Trance, which overlaps with meditation, and has elements of hypnosis, is essentially a means of accessing the deeper parts of the soul, of going into the psyche and accessing the shadow and its disparate unconscious parts, so as to allow integration and healing. Trance/hypnosis is also used in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP).</p>
