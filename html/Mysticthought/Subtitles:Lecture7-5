00:00:00,350 --&gt; 00:00:03,350
So I want to speak now about,uh, another
major

2
00:00:03,350 --&gt; 00:00:06,120
topic which came up here and there
throughout the

3
00:00:06,120 --&gt; 00:00:07,750
course, but now I really want to zoom in

4
00:00:07,750 --&gt; 00:00:11,070
on it, and that's the relationship between
psychology and literature.

5
00:00:12,120 --&gt; 00:00:14,520
because as I said, a big part of modernity
is

6
00:00:14,520 --&gt; 00:00:17,650
the development of literature, for
instance the development of the novel.

7
00:00:17,650 --&gt; 00:00:20,190
And of course, today if we look from the
point of view

8
00:00:20,190 --&gt; 00:00:21,710
of a heart of the presence,

9
00:00:21,710 --&gt; 00:00:25,350
the relationship between literature, and
mysticism,

10
00:00:25,350 --&gt; 00:00:28,310
magic, myth, and so on is so obvious.

11
00:00:28,310 --&gt; 00:00:30,990
That's why I started out the course by
mentioning Harry Potter

12
00:00:30,990 --&gt; 00:00:33,600
and, of course, The Lord of the Rings, the
whole mythical world.

13
00:00:33,600 --&gt; 00:00:34,934
And all kinds, all the literature

14
00:00:34,934 --&gt; 00:00:37,310
about magic and shamanism, Philip Pullman,
etcetera.

15
00:00:37,310 --&gt; 00:00:40,810
All of this is very much present in what
is today

16
00:00:40,810 --&gt; 00:00:44,590
the most influential form of literature
and as I, I often

17
00:00:44,590 --&gt; 00:00:47,480
say, that in my other capacity when I go
in life,

18
00:00:47,480 --&gt; 00:00:50,730
when I go to, children's bookshops, it's
very hard to find

19
00:00:50,730 --&gt; 00:00:52,530
books today that aren't fantasy.

20
00:00:52,530 --&gt; 00:00:54,300
Actually, we did a competition now

21
00:00:54,300 --&gt; 00:00:56,955
of, short stories for children, and
[INAUDIBLE]

22
00:00:56,955 --&gt; 00:01:00,734
please do not send fantasy literature,
because we want something else as well.

23
00:01:00,734 --&gt; 00:01:04,640
So that's the present, and we can speak
about the past, about the novel.

24
00:01:04,640 --&gt; 00:01:07,110
What I want to focus on for a moment is
poetry.

25
00:01:08,190 --&gt; 00:01:11,040
And to speak a bit about the historical
background of this.

26
00:01:11,040 --&gt; 00:01:14,952
That's, in early modernity, we had what's
called,

27
00:01:14,952 --&gt; 00:01:17,660
metaphysical poets, which may have been a
group or

28
00:01:17,660 --&gt; 00:01:22,110
a looser group, people like John Donne and
we wrote

29
00:01:22,110 --&gt; 00:01:24,770
poetry, and there's a very interesting
book about this, real

30
00:01:24,770 --&gt; 00:01:28,640
gem by Louis, Louis Marx, about the poetry
of meditation.

31
00:01:29,730 --&gt; 00:01:31,554
That, this whole poetic movement was

32
00:01:31,554 --&gt; 00:01:34,233
really translating certain meditative
techniques and

33
00:01:34,233 --&gt; 00:01:38,800
ideas, that we'll speak about in a moment,
into the language of poetry.

34
00:01:38,800 --&gt; 00:01:40,010
And this movement had tremendous

35
00:01:40,010 --&gt; 00:01:43,260
influence later on, on a whole series of
poets, what's

36
00:01:43,260 --&gt; 00:01:46,605
called the Catholic Literature Revival of
the late 19 early 20th

37
00:01:46,605 --&gt; 00:01:52,552
century: Gerald Manley Hopkins and T.S.
Eliot and others and then

38
00:01:52,552 --&gt; 00:01:56,160
it had further implications which we'll
speak about in a moment.

39
00:01:57,510 --&gt; 00:02:01,410
And this movement was very much focused on
meditative techniques, as found in

40
00:02:01,410 --&gt; 00:02:05,070
one of the great classics of modern
mysticism and psychology, which I really

41
00:02:05,070 --&gt; 00:02:06,940
recommend reading at some point.

42
00:02:06,940 --&gt; 00:02:12,340
The Spiritual Exercises by Saint Ignatius
of Loyola, the founder of Jesuit movement.

43
00:02:12,340 --&gt; 00:02:15,530
The Jesuit movement, like the Kabbalistic
world, like the Confucian

44
00:02:15,530 --&gt; 00:02:20,040
world, is a world of tremendous
scholarship, like many Islamic worlds.

45
00:02:20,040 --&gt; 00:02:21,809
And enough as I could mention a very

46
00:02:21,809 --&gt; 00:02:24,676
great focus on scholarship, on learning on
the texts,

47
00:02:24,676 --&gt; 00:02:27,360
which is, and this one text, Saint
Ignatius' text

48
00:02:27,360 --&gt; 00:02:30,166
became so influential that it influenced
not just this

49
00:02:30,166 --&gt; 00:02:34,680
poetical movements all the way through to
T.S.Elliot, it influenced Jung, who had a

50
00:02:34,680 --&gt; 00:02:37,791
seminar on Ignatius' techniques, a
little-known text,

51
00:02:37,791 --&gt; 00:02:40,820
which was published,uh, not too long ago.

52
00:02:40,820 --&gt; 00:02:46,120
And we have this whole, arc of influence
all the way to

53
00:02:46,120 --&gt; 00:02:48,820
Gerard Manley Hopkins, as I said, who was
also influenced by Ignatius.

54
00:02:48,820 --&gt; 00:02:50,878
There's a whole book about this.

55
00:02:50,878 --&gt; 00:02:55,410
And, all these poets were very, very deep
into this type of meditative approach,

56
00:02:55,410 --&gt; 00:02:56,500
and in the next segment it'll show

57
00:02:56,500 --&gt; 00:03:00,380
how it influences the present contemporary
Christianity.

58
00:03:00,380 --&gt; 00:03:03,380
Now, this is one example, and then if we
go

59
00:03:03,380 --&gt; 00:03:06,710
further into 20th century we see people
like William Yates.

60
00:03:06,710 --&gt; 00:03:09,990
The tremendous influence of, of pre-modern
myth as well,

61
00:03:09,990 --&gt; 00:03:13,330
of, ancient Irish myth, but also, for
instance, of Kabbalah,

62
00:03:13,330 --&gt; 00:03:16,703
of the Christian Kabbalah of early 20th
century, which

63
00:03:16,703 --&gt; 00:03:19,950
is very important for him, and other forms
of mysticism.

64
00:03:19,950 --&gt; 00:03:20,740
So we have these great

65
00:03:20,740 --&gt; 00:03:23,060
poets, these tremendously important
figures

66
00:03:23,060 --&gt; 00:03:25,990
in the 20th century poetical revolution,

67
00:03:25,990 --&gt; 00:03:29,760
people, and again, different periods,
different locations, but if you think

68
00:03:29,760 --&gt; 00:03:32,660
of people like Rilke in the
German-speaking world and people like

69
00:03:32,660 --&gt; 00:03:36,020
Elliot and Yeats in the English-speaking
world, and this is earlier roots.

70
00:03:36,020 --&gt; 00:03:38,770
As I said, in Hopkins, in William Blake,

71
00:03:38,770 --&gt; 00:03:41,030
great poet and artist who was influenced
by

72
00:03:41,030 --&gt; 00:03:42,790
Yaakov Berman and the other mystics that
we

73
00:03:42,790 --&gt; 00:03:46,080
spoke about, [INAUDIBLE] Kabbalah, his
whole book's about it.

74
00:03:46,080 --&gt; 00:03:49,190
So it's very important to think also if
[INAUDIBLE] is context.

75
00:03:49,190 --&gt; 00:03:52,875
I think personally that mysticism has more
to do with art than of science.

76
00:03:52,875 --&gt; 00:03:56,340
It has, with all by respect for brain
science, and

77
00:03:56,340 --&gt; 00:03:59,790
recent developments in the study of
mysticism for brain science,

78
00:03:59,790 --&gt; 00:04:02,952
and brain waves, etcetera, and meditation,
I think what's more

79
00:04:02,952 --&gt; 00:04:05,700
important is to see mysticism as a form of
art.

80
00:04:05,700 --&gt; 00:04:07,640
How it expresses itself in poetry.

81
00:04:07,640 --&gt; 00:04:11,460
How it expresses itself in aesthetics, in
ideas of a beautiful, or what

82
00:04:11,460 --&gt; 00:04:14,490
beauty is.
Pete la Lachute wrote a lot about this.

83
00:04:14,490 --&gt; 00:04:17,470
These are directions which are being
explored today in scholarship,

84
00:04:18,530 --&gt; 00:04:21,850
and I hope to of course explore for myself
also.

85
00:04:21,850 --&gt; 00:04:23,260
So, this is a realm, I think it's

86
00:04:23,260 --&gt; 00:04:26,240
very important to look at mysticism
through this prism.

87
00:04:26,240 --&gt; 00:04:28,260
And actually, Jung at one point, he has an
internal figure

88
00:04:28,260 --&gt; 00:04:30,690
who says to him, you're doing art, you're
not doing science.

89
00:04:30,690 --&gt; 00:04:33,980
So here's the whole world of literature,
and

90
00:04:33,980 --&gt; 00:04:36,900
I spoke about Salinger, I spoke about many
examples

91
00:04:36,900 --&gt; 00:04:40,220
of [INAUDIBLE] of how mysticism influences
literary

92
00:04:40,220 --&gt; 00:04:42,610
writing, not only, before Harry Potter as
well.
