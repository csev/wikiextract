1
00:00:00,520 --&gt; 00:00:04,490
So, like in the case of Rabbi Kook,

2
00:00:04,490 --&gt; 00:00:08,610
the resolution of all this psychic
conflict involves going

3
00:00:08,610 --&gt; 00:00:12,330
beyond one's own hunger, one's own desire,
and one's

4
00:00:12,330 --&gt; 00:00:15,980
own self-will, to align oneself with the
divine will.

5
00:00:15,980 --&gt; 00:00:18,160
And I want to speak about this problem

6
00:00:18,160 --&gt; 00:00:21,000
of will, because in Protestantism, there's
a sense that

7
00:00:21,000 --&gt; 00:00:22,690
one shouldn't rely so much on one's own

8
00:00:22,690 --&gt; 00:00:25,780
will, because one has to rely more on
faith,

9
00:00:25,780 --&gt; 00:00:27,380
on grace, and so on.

10
00:00:27,380 --&gt; 00:00:30,130
And Böhme departs from this tradition to
some extent.

11
00:00:30,130 --&gt; 00:00:32,670
Because he, he very much, like the
Kabbalists,

12
00:00:32,670 --&gt; 00:00:34,610
and this is one point where people have
actually

13
00:00:34,610 --&gt; 00:00:38,160
spoken about the explicit influence of
Kabbalah, especially modern

14
00:00:38,160 --&gt; 00:00:40,190
Kabbalah that puts so much emphasis on the
will.

15
00:00:40,190 --&gt; 00:00:45,220
And we've already spoken about this.
That Böhme focuses on the problem of will.

16
00:00:45,220 --&gt; 00:00:47,006
And it's based on theme afterwards in
German

17
00:00:47,006 --&gt; 00:00:50,630
philosophy, with Hegel, with Schopenhauer,
with Nietzsche, etc.

18
00:00:50,630 --&gt; 00:00:54,660
Now, what happens with the will?
One has to transform one's will.

19
00:00:54,660 --&gt; 00:00:59,028
It's not about leaving one's own will,
one's desire, one's creative impulse.

20
00:00:59,028 --&gt; 00:01:00,830
Because this is a creative impulse.

21
00:01:00,830 --&gt; 00:01:02,710
You have to want something to create.

22
00:01:02,710 --&gt; 00:01:04,680
But you have to align your will with the
will

23
00:01:04,680 --&gt; 00:01:07,880
of the divine, so that your will becomes
the divine will.

24
00:01:07,880 --&gt; 00:01:10,240
And you have to, in that sense, join God's
own

25
00:01:10,240 --&gt; 00:01:13,873
therapy, God’s own working through, how
the divine will develops.

26
00:01:13,873 --&gt; 00:01:16,170
It's also how the mystic's will develops.

27
00:01:16,170 --&gt; 00:01:20,000
So it’s all a very close process.
The two processes are parallel.

28
00:01:20,000 --&gt; 00:01:24,352
Now there's a very interesting discussion
of this in Kabbalah again, that

29
00:01:24,352 --&gt; 00:01:28,553
Rabbi Kook says that all sadness comes,
where does psychic pain come from?

30
00:01:28,553 --&gt; 00:01:30,540
Where does sadness come form?

31
00:01:30,540 --&gt; 00:01:32,970
From not des, wanting what God wants.

32
00:01:32,970 --&gt; 00:01:36,110
So this alignment is the resolution of
psychic pain.

33
00:01:36,110 --&gt; 00:01:37,600
And there's a very nice image in Rabbi
Ashlag,

34
00:01:37,600 --&gt; 00:01:40,352
who's a contemporary of Rabbi Kook, that
we spoke about.

35
00:01:40,352 --&gt; 00:01:41,250
That it's

36
00:01:41,250 --&gt; 00:01:44,010
as if somebody comes and gives a person a
meal.

37
00:01:44,010 --&gt; 00:01:46,180
And what one has to do is take the desire
to

38
00:01:46,180 --&gt; 00:01:49,626
receive, to have a meal, in order to fill
one's own hunger.

39
00:01:49,626 --&gt; 00:01:54,030
Again, speaking analytically about the
baby in the first months of life.

40
00:01:54,030 --&gt; 00:01:58,920
And eventually one begins to receive in
order to satisfy the will of the giver, of

41
00:01:58,920 --&gt; 00:02:04,550
God.
So this is a huge theme, of lack.

42
00:02:04,550 --&gt; 00:02:06,360
Of how we transform our sense of

43
00:02:06,360 --&gt; 00:02:08,840
hunger, of lack, into something else,
which

44
00:02:08,840 --&gt; 00:02:11,380
is very much developed in Buddhist
psychology again.

45
00:02:11,380 --&gt; 00:02:13,281
David Loy has written about it, and
others.

46
00:02:13,281 --&gt; 00:02:14,528
I won't go into it here.

47
00:02:14,528 --&gt; 00:02:17,390
I just want to point that it is a very
strong comparative theme here.

48
00:02:18,430 --&gt; 00:02:20,830
And from this, I want to, this is my
entree

49
00:02:20,830 --&gt; 00:02:23,180
into the text itself, the Forty Questions
of the Soul.

50
00:02:24,340 --&gt; 00:02:28,690
Now I'm following the, when I speak about
images, I'm following

51
00:02:28,690 --&gt; 00:02:31,440
the images in the number that they appear
in the website

52
00:02:31,440 --&gt; 00:02:34,788
link to Chadwyck website, which has the
the

53
00:02:34,788 --&gt; 00:02:38,330
Böhme texts, or the Forty Questions of the
Soul.

54
00:02:38,330 --&gt; 00:02:41,420
I want to say something about this text
from 1620, is that

55
00:02:41,420 --&gt; 00:02:46,810
it's part of a series of 17th century
texts devoted to the soul.

56
00:02:46,810 --&gt; 00:02:48,060
So we have this text.

57
00:02:48,060 --&gt; 00:02:51,530
We have a Kabbalistic text called Mishnat
Adam, The Soul of Man.

58
00:02:51,530 --&gt; 00:02:56,520
And there are other texts like this that
speak explicitly about the soul as

59
00:02:56,520 --&gt; 00:02:59,300
a major theme of discourse.
This is the important thing to notice.

60
00:03:00,720 --&gt; 00:03:04,224
Now the questions, the forty questions
mean that the way

61
00:03:04,224 --&gt; 00:03:07,590
to self knowledge is to ask questions
about the soul.

62
00:03:07,590 --&gt; 00:03:11,500
It's a dialectical process of asking
questions in

63
00:03:11,500 --&gt; 00:03:15,300
order to get to the depth of a soul.

64
00:03:15,300 --&gt; 00:03:18,120
And again, he, he says we have to start
with the

65
00:03:18,120 --&gt; 00:03:22,040
desire of a soul, the soul is like a
desiring entity.

66
00:03:22,040 --&gt; 00:03:24,160
Again, very psychoanalytical, very much
maybe

67
00:03:24,160 --&gt; 00:03:26,828
like French psychoanalysis, Jaques Lacan
and others.

68
00:03:28,680 --&gt; 00:03:30,700
Because without desire, he says, you only
have stillness.

69
00:03:32,290 --&gt; 00:03:33,949
Now think about the previous class.

70
00:03:33,949 --&gt; 00:03:38,510
The Quietists would think this is a good
state, to have quiet sleep, stillness.

71
00:03:38,510 --&gt; 00:03:40,900
But this is Protestant mysticism.
This is a shoemaker.

72
00:03:40,900 --&gt; 00:03:45,090
This is somebody who wants to be involved
in the world, in a creative process.

73
00:03:45,090 --&gt; 00:03:47,310
Without desire, you only have stillness.

74
00:03:47,310 --&gt; 00:03:49,370
To get movement, you need desire.

75
00:03:49,370 --&gt; 00:03:53,620
The movement of creation, creation, the,
the progression of creation is desire.

76
00:03:54,990 --&gt; 00:03:59,720
And movement comes from divine desire.
So this is image 12.

77
00:03:59,720 --&gt; 00:04:03,920
Now image 27-38, he says, how do we
transform desire?

78
00:04:04,920 --&gt; 00:04:06,220
He says this is the highest mystery.

79
00:04:06,220 --&gt; 00:04:08,230
How does one work with will, with desire.

80
00:04:08,230 --&gt; 00:04:12,520
This is what he describes again, esoteric
level, the highest mystery.

81
00:04:12,520 --&gt; 00:04:15,150
You have to cast away outer reason, the
intellect.

82
00:04:15,150 --&gt; 00:04:17,060
That's very familiar by now.

83
00:04:17,060 --&gt; 00:04:18,970
And you have to strengthen your will.

84
00:04:18,970 --&gt; 00:04:22,690
You have to go deeper into your will, and
through this you find God's will.

85
00:04:22,690 --&gt; 00:04:25,360
You find what God wants for you, what you
want for your own desire.

86
00:04:25,360 --&gt; 00:04:27,480
You find the divine creative desire.

87
00:04:28,590 --&gt; 00:04:32,490
And then God's will will reveal itself in
your will and give you power.

88
00:04:32,490 --&gt; 00:04:34,820
So empowerment, which is very related to
will

89
00:04:34,820 --&gt; 00:04:38,100
in Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and so on,
Hegel,

90
00:04:38,100 --&gt; 00:04:40,220
again looking forward to German
philosophy.

91
00:04:40,220 --&gt; 00:04:42,120
The theme of power is very related to

92
00:04:42,120 --&gt; 00:04:45,100
will, because empowerment comes by
strengthening the will.

93
00:04:45,100 --&gt; 00:04:47,360
But the power is not one's own power.

94
00:04:47,360 --&gt; 00:04:50,010
And here, of course, Böhme is a very
Protestant thinker.

95
00:04:50,010 --&gt; 00:04:51,990
And this also links back to Quietism.

96
00:04:51,990 --&gt; 00:04:55,610
It's something which comes from outside in
a way, from inside and from outside.

97
00:04:55,610 --&gt; 00:04:57,190
There's a dialectic here.

98
00:04:57,190 --&gt; 00:05:01,670
One goes deeper into one's own will in
order to discover that it's divine will.

99
00:05:01,670 --&gt; 00:05:03,550
So we do have the idea of grace.

100
00:05:03,550 --&gt; 00:05:06,710
We do have idea, idea of receiving from
the divine passively.

101
00:05:06,710 --&gt; 00:05:12,030
But it comes through a very intense and
painful creative process.

102
00:05:12,030 --&gt; 00:05:17,200
And this is a very, again, strong move in
modernity, from reason,

103
00:05:17,200 --&gt; 00:05:20,000
which dominated medieval thought,
pre-modern thought,

104
00:05:20,000 --&gt; 00:05:22,450
to will, which dominates modern thought.

105
00:05:22,450 --&gt; 00:05:24,150
This has a Fascist branch.

106
00:05:24,150 --&gt; 00:05:28,000
That's why I mentioned Heidegger, and
Jung, and Carl Schmitt.

107
00:05:28,000 --&gt; 00:05:28,940
And it has more

108
00:05:28,940 --&gt; 00:05:33,000
benign branches of, also in French
philosophy, Bergson, Bergson and so on.

109
00:05:34,700 --&gt; 00:05:37,030
This has all kinds of branches, and for
people interested in

110
00:05:37,030 --&gt; 00:05:41,160
philosophy, this is something to explore
in discussion groups or so on.

111
00:05:41,160 --&gt; 00:05:43,200
Now we spoke about this in Kabbalah.

112
00:05:43,200 --&gt; 00:05:46,456
Luzzatto, Rabbi Kook, Rabbi Ashlag all
focused on

113
00:05:46,456 --&gt; 00:05:49,608
this question of will, the Vilna Goan,
Kremer.

114
00:05:49,608 --&gt; 00:05:52,580
And on the question of power, which goes
together with will.

115
00:05:53,810 --&gt; 00:05:56,190
Now this whole creative ferment, this
whole

116
00:05:56,190 --&gt; 00:05:59,730
strongly creative process, intense
pressure, is of

117
00:05:59,730 --&gt; 00:06:03,390
course very reminiscent of alchemy, which
developed,

118
00:06:03,390 --&gt; 00:06:05,730
continues to develop in the modern period.

119
00:06:05,730 --&gt; 00:06:09,247
Afterwards, because of the rise of modern
science, it becomes less fashionable.

120
00:06:09,247 --&gt; 00:06:13,023
In the 17th century, 18th century even,
alchemy's still very strong

121
00:06:13,023 --&gt; 00:06:16,248
in the Jewish world, in the circle of
Luzzatto and elsewhere.

122
00:06:16,248 --&gt; 00:06:19,670
And Böhme is certainly related to
alchemical thought.

123
00:06:19,670 --&gt; 00:06:22,510
And this is one of Jung's innovations, is
to take Böhme,

124
00:06:22,510 --&gt; 00:06:26,800
to take Paracelsus, an alchemical thinker
who was an influence on Böhme.

125
00:06:26,800 --&gt; 00:06:29,880
To take other alchemical texts in the
German tradition, to put

126
00:06:29,880 --&gt; 00:06:33,336
them all together with a bit of Kabbalah,
usually mediated for alchemy.

127
00:06:33,336 --&gt; 00:06:37,130
Jung didn't have direct access to Kabbalah
for Hebrew.

128
00:06:37,130 --&gt; 00:06:39,940
Even Nietzsche wasn't so good in Hebrew,
Jung certainly not.

129
00:06:39,940 --&gt; 00:06:45,420
And through this mediated access to
Kabbalah, for alchemy,

130
00:06:45,420 --&gt; 00:06:48,170
Jung developed this emphasis which is, of
course, I

131
00:06:48,170 --&gt; 00:06:51,390
would say part of German mysticism, or
German speaking mysticism.

132
00:06:51,390 --&gt; 00:06:54,382
So it's important to see the alchemical
elements,

133
00:06:54,382 --&gt; 00:06:57,856
the ferment of the creative process, the
opposing forces.

134
00:06:57,856 --&gt; 00:07:01,165
Soon we'll speak about fire, and it
becomes more alchemical.

135
00:07:01,165 --&gt; 00:07:02,229
I'm not going to go into the whole

136
00:07:02,229 --&gt; 00:07:04,080
history of alchemy, just to point to this
connection.

137
00:07:05,170 --&gt; 00:07:08,549
Now I want to move on a bit.

138
00:07:08,549 --&gt; 00:07:10,769
Image 79, Böhme says

139
00:07:10,769 --&gt; 00:07:15,430
explicitly, all lieth in the Will.
That's a strong statement.

140
00:07:15,430 --&gt; 00:07:16,360
It's all about the will.

141
00:07:16,360 --&gt; 00:07:20,520
And now I want to in the next segment I

142
00:07:20,520 --&gt; 00:07:22,750
want to move on and speak about a
different issue.

143
00:07:22,750 --&gt; 00:07:27,624
But first of all, let's wrap this up by
emphasizing again, all lieth in the Will.
