1
00:00:00,250 --&gt; 00:00:01,500
I want to focus on this idea of

2
00:00:01,500 --&gt; 00:00:03,750
passivity, because it's really interesting
and really important.

3
00:00:04,970 --&gt; 00:00:07,260
The, there was, there's a general term
that we use for

4
00:00:07,260 --&gt; 00:00:11,790
certain movement in the 17th, 18th
centuries, which is called Quietism.

5
00:00:11,790 --&gt; 00:00:15,440
And of course the very idea of being quiet
is already a move towards Passivity.

6
00:00:15,440 --&gt; 00:00:19,320
And I want to explore this, this movement
of Quietism,

7
00:00:19,320 --&gt; 00:00:25,180
because as an Israeli scholar called Rivka
Shatz, that's Shatz,

8
00:00:25,180 --&gt; 00:00:31,760
who really developed this idea of the
connection between Quietism and Hasidism.

9
00:00:31,760 --&gt; 00:00:35,760
So it's very relevant really for the study
of Jewish Mysticism.

10
00:00:35,760 --&gt; 00:00:39,500
Now Shatz wrote it in a very, in a sort
of, what I would say, preliminary kind

11
00:00:39,500 --&gt; 00:00:44,920
of way, like exercise, I would say and one
has to really flesh it out a lot more.

12
00:00:46,040 --&gt; 00:00:50,830
Now, the Quietistic Movement continues
older ideas.

13
00:00:50,830 --&gt; 00:00:54,980
And this is very important, that in the
beginning of Modernity in Spain,

14
00:00:54,980 --&gt; 00:00:57,490
around the 15th,16th century, we have

15
00:00:57,490 --&gt; 00:01:00,720
a movement of what's called illuminated
people.

16
00:01:00,720 --&gt; 00:01:02,090
Alumbrados.

17
00:01:02,090 --&gt; 00:01:04,450
And again, I'll be using quite a few
Spanish, Italian,

18
00:01:04,450 --&gt; 00:01:08,530
French words, so forgive my pronunciation,
if you are native speakers.

19
00:01:08,530 --&gt; 00:01:10,930
And now, this was a movement that was

20
00:01:10,930 --&gt; 00:01:13,910
persecuted by the Inquisition and soon
we'll see why.

21
00:01:13,910 --&gt; 00:01:16,380
But this is going to recur, this phase
persecuted

22
00:01:16,380 --&gt; 00:01:19,250
by the authorities, which is also true by
the way true of

23
00:01:19,250 --&gt; 00:01:23,180
early Hasidism of Luzzatto in the 18th
century that we've spoken about.

24
00:01:23,180 --&gt; 00:01:26,330
This theme of persecution by the
authorities will reoccur.

25
00:01:26,330 --&gt; 00:01:29,970
Because again, we have weakening of
traditional authority,

26
00:01:29,970 --&gt; 00:01:31,400
movements that challenge traditional

27
00:01:31,400 --&gt; 00:01:34,800
authority, authority persecutes them
initially.

28
00:01:34,800 --&gt; 00:01:36,840
After a while, absorbs them, the
routinization of

29
00:01:36,840 --&gt; 00:01:39,098
charisma, and in the end, it starts again.

30
00:01:39,098 --&gt; 00:01:42,468
Now the,

31
00:01:42,468 --&gt; 00:01:48,270
we have a tremendous resource that hasn't
even been tapped, that in recent

32
00:01:48,270 --&gt; 00:01:51,710
years the church has opened a lot of the
files of the Inquisition.

33
00:01:52,900 --&gt; 00:01:57,650
And we have an enormous database now that
just is waiting for researchers who are

34
00:01:57,650 --&gt; 00:02:02,230
trained in the languages, in the languages
of early modernity in Spain and so on.

35
00:02:03,820 --&gt; 00:02:07,520
And who've got the Canute manuscripts,
which is not simple fit,

36
00:02:07,520 --&gt; 00:02:09,050
but we've also got computers that can

37
00:02:09,050 --&gt; 00:02:12,290
help us more and more and sophisticated
computers.

38
00:02:12,290 --&gt; 00:02:14,640
So this is just a huge mine really,

39
00:02:14,640 --&gt; 00:02:17,790
of material waiting to be opened up, and
we've

40
00:02:17,790 --&gt; 00:02:20,265
learned so much about all these heretical
and

41
00:02:20,265 --&gt; 00:02:24,050
semi-heretical movements and the, how
authorities reacted to them.

42
00:02:24,050 --&gt; 00:02:27,840
And we can think historian Carlo Ginzburg
in UCLA, who's

43
00:02:27,840 --&gt; 00:02:33,000
really made a career, a successful career,
working with these materials

44
00:02:33,000 --&gt; 00:02:34,120
on Inquisition.

45
00:02:34,120 --&gt; 00:02:38,240
And he was one of the people by the way,
who facilitated through letters to the

46
00:02:38,240 --&gt; 00:02:46,035
church to the pope opening up much more of
the files of the Inquisition.

47
00:02:46,035 --&gt; 00:02:49,140
Now, I want to speak about certain ideas
that

48
00:02:49,140 --&gt; 00:02:54,060
created a suspicion toward the, the
illuminated, people in Spain.

49
00:02:54,060 --&gt; 00:02:57,000
And even Ignatius of Loyola, who became
afterwards a more,

50
00:02:58,170 --&gt; 00:03:02,190
respectable figure, was suspected of being
connected to this movement.

51
00:03:02,190 --&gt; 00:03:05,210
I don't know if it's true or not, but he
was suspected.

52
00:03:05,210 --&gt; 00:03:07,030
One of the things that they say, is

53
00:03:07,030 --&gt; 00:03:09,210
that one gets to a certain level of
illumination

54
00:03:09,210 --&gt; 00:03:12,980
like enlightenment, what has less external
restrictions, one

55
00:03:12,980 --&gt; 00:03:15,670
can act in the external world with less
restriction.

56
00:03:15,670 --&gt; 00:03:19,870
Because our inner world is already so
wholesome, so good, that it just overflows

57
00:03:19,870 --&gt; 00:03:23,440
into the external world and one doesn't
need this so much of the rules

58
00:03:23,440 --&gt; 00:03:27,640
that ordinary people are bound by, in
religious terms.

59
00:03:27,640 --&gt; 00:03:29,660
And that includes, by the way, sexual
freedom and

60
00:03:29,660 --&gt; 00:03:31,990
again, this is like looking forward a bit
to psychoanalysis.

61
00:03:33,100 --&gt; 00:03:35,890
So it was a very important insight by Jeff
Kripal that

62
00:03:35,890 --&gt; 00:03:38,420
I've mentioned a few times, whom I've
mentioned a few times, that

63
00:03:40,580 --&gt; 00:03:46,000
the mystical enlightenment, awakening, and
awakening

64
00:03:46,000 --&gt; 00:03:51,610
of libido, of sexual energy and desire for
more sexual freedom often go together.

65
00:03:51,610 --&gt; 00:03:53,990
We see it very much in the eastern
context,

66
00:03:53,990 --&gt; 00:03:57,390
in the Tantric movement, the, in India and
then Tibet.

67
00:03:57,390 --&gt; 00:03:59,700
We see it other places as well.

68
00:03:59,700 --&gt; 00:04:03,690
Sometimes in the Muslim world, it has
sometimes homosexual manifestations.

69
00:04:03,690 --&gt; 00:04:05,810
And we see it in the Jewish world with the
Sabbatean movement and

70
00:04:05,810 --&gt; 00:04:08,270
afterwards in the 18th century, the

71
00:04:08,270 --&gt; 00:04:11,900
Frankist branch of the Sabbatean movement,
very

72
00:04:11,900 --&gt; 00:04:16,530
much, some, it goes together with a desire
for greater, greater sexual freedom.

73
00:04:16,530 --&gt; 00:04:17,690
Which, by the way, is part of the

74
00:04:17,690 --&gt; 00:04:20,190
agenda of modernity and psychoanalysis did
not invent it.

75
00:04:21,310 --&gt; 00:04:25,360
Now, there's an interesting debate here
between Jung and Freud, that

76
00:04:25,360 --&gt; 00:04:31,020
Freud thought that sexual repression,
represses all kinds of, forms of energy.

77
00:04:31,020 --&gt; 00:04:32,460
And what one has to do is to take this

78
00:04:32,460 --&gt; 00:04:36,700
request energy, sublimate it and use it
for creative purposes.

79
00:04:36,700 --&gt; 00:04:38,510
That's why Freud was very interested in
creative

80
00:04:38,510 --&gt; 00:04:42,820
figures like Leonardo da Vinci, again,
early modern figure.

81
00:04:42,820 --&gt; 00:04:46,410
Now, Jung had a very interesting debate
with this.

82
00:04:46,410 --&gt; 00:04:48,780
One of his first early debates with Freud
was

83
00:04:48,780 --&gt; 00:04:51,540
that he said, no, we've got a general
psychic energy,

84
00:04:51,540 --&gt; 00:04:54,110
which is actually quite spiritual in its
nature and

85
00:04:54,110 --&gt; 00:04:56,180
sexuality is one of the forms that it can
take.

86
00:04:57,230 --&gt; 00:04:59,710
The sexual and spiritual are connected,
but it's not the

87
00:04:59,710 --&gt; 00:05:02,540
only form, it's not the root form, like
Freud thought.

88
00:05:02,540 --&gt; 00:05:04,060
But on the contrary, maybe the spiritual
is

89
00:05:04,060 --&gt; 00:05:08,070
actually the primary form of energy, of
psychic energy.

90
00:05:08,070 --&gt; 00:05:10,890
Eh, and I want to remind, when we speak
about Hesychasm that

91
00:05:10,890 --&gt; 00:05:12,700
[UNKNOWN] is actually a technical term

92
00:05:12,700 --&gt; 00:05:15,600
in Eastern Mysti, eh, Eastern Christian
Mysticism.

93
00:05:16,960 --&gt; 00:05:19,180
Eh, and of course this wouldn't have used
the exact

94
00:05:19,180 --&gt; 00:05:23,550
word, energy, when the Hasidisms speak
about [FOREIGN] or hayyut.

95
00:05:23,550 --&gt; 00:05:27,940
So I guess one would transliterate this
hayyut,

96
00:05:29,970 --&gt; 00:05:33,140
speaking about life force, vitality.
It's very close to the ideals of energy.

97
00:05:34,670 --&gt; 00:05:39,720
Now, the, one more point about this
movement

98
00:05:39,720 --&gt; 00:05:42,750
in Spain in the 16th, 15th, 16th century
is

99
00:05:42,750 --&gt; 00:05:44,900
that this was the time when the
Inquisition

100
00:05:44,900 --&gt; 00:05:47,920
was really heavily on the case of the
Jews.

101
00:05:47,920 --&gt; 00:05:50,360
That the Jews were forced to convert to
Christianity

102
00:05:50,360 --&gt; 00:05:54,300
or leave Spain, as it became the Catholic
kingdom.

103
00:05:54,300 --&gt; 00:05:55,380
A strong

104
00:05:55,380 --&gt; 00:05:58,260
early modern connection between state and
religion.

105
00:05:58,260 --&gt; 00:06:03,550
And many Jews decided to convert to become
Conversos or Marranos, hidden Jews really.

106
00:06:03,550 --&gt; 00:06:09,970
And the inquisition wanted to sort of
ferret out these hidden Jews and use

107
00:06:09,970 --&gt; 00:06:16,350
torture as a means to get confessions.
And, as of the action to this persecution

108
00:06:16,350 --&gt; 00:06:20,570
by the church, there was the movement, a
mystical movement at the end of the

109
00:06:20,570 --&gt; 00:06:21,960
Jewish period in Spain.

110
00:06:21,960 --&gt; 00:06:26,775
Before the expulsion and also among these
Conversos circles, these groups of

111
00:06:26,775 --&gt; 00:06:31,230
Conversos, called the book of the, The
Book of the Responded Entity.

112
00:06:31,230 --&gt; 00:06:35,157
Sefer ha meshiv has researched a lot and

113
00:06:35,157 --&gt; 00:06:40,920
ran this book [UNKNOWN] that is passive
with revelations.

114
00:06:40,920 --&gt; 00:06:42,540
When you put yourself in a passive state

115
00:06:42,540 --&gt; 00:06:46,170
and receive revelations which will lead to
God manifesting

116
00:06:46,170 --&gt; 00:06:49,100
himself here on Earth, coming down.

117
00:06:49,100 --&gt; 00:06:50,660
It's a very sort of Christian idea

118
00:06:50,660 --&gt; 00:06:54,360
of incarnation, of God coming, manifesting
flesh.

119
00:06:54,360 --&gt; 00:06:57,000
And we see the whole new revelation, which
is not

120
00:06:57,000 --&gt; 00:06:59,980
the traditional revelation, this is really
the beginning of modern Kabbalah.

121
00:06:59,980 --&gt; 00:07:02,920
And the challenge, a certain challenge

122
00:07:02,920 --&gt; 00:07:04,960
to authority, not just the Christian
authority,

123
00:07:04,960 --&gt; 00:07:06,460
also towards the Jewish world in

124
00:07:06,460 --&gt; 00:07:11,550
a way Radical mystic, intensely mystical
movements.

125
00:07:11,550 --&gt; 00:07:16,780
Now, what are the connections between
these Alumbrados

126
00:07:16,780 --&gt; 00:07:21,270
and the circle of the, the book Meshiv,
Meshiv.

127
00:07:21,270 --&gt; 00:07:24,610
I'm not sure, but this is one of the
connections we have to notice.

128
00:07:24,610 --&gt; 00:07:26,350
A lot of these subtle connections will
begin

129
00:07:26,350 --&gt; 00:07:28,920
to recur as we speak about this material.

130
00:07:28,920 --&gt; 00:07:33,320
And as one of my teachers, [UNKNOWN], once
said, we're not in a court of law.

131
00:07:33,320 --&gt; 00:07:36,570
That is, researchers do not have to
convince beyond all

132
00:07:36,570 --&gt; 00:07:38,690
reasonable doubt like in a murder case.

133
00:07:38,690 --&gt; 00:07:40,550
We can point to the connections, we can
point

134
00:07:40,550 --&gt; 00:07:43,520
to possibilities and we can leave it for
further research.
