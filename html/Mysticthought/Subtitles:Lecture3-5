1
00:00:00,230 --&gt; 00:00:05,220
So now I want to speak also about the
circle of Rabbi Kook,

2
00:00:05,220 --&gt; 00:00:08,770
of how Rabbi Kook's thinking is developed
by the next generation of his school.

3
00:00:10,420 --&gt; 00:00:14,580
And, when we'll conclude this lesson,
we'll speak a little bit about the state

4
00:00:14,580 --&gt; 00:00:16,430
of Jewish Mysticism today before we move

5
00:00:16,430 --&gt; 00:00:18,160
on to other mystical systems and the
other.

6
00:00:19,970 --&gt; 00:00:22,560
So we saw what my cooks thinking.

7
00:00:22,560 --&gt; 00:00:26,120
We saw we had a bit of a taste of it.
It's so much right in.

8
00:00:26,120 --&gt; 00:00:28,550
So much we muted about, so just a taste.

9
00:00:29,710 --&gt; 00:00:31,110
And we saw how he thinks that

10
00:00:31,110 --&gt; 00:00:33,300
the superficial choice that people have
with it

11
00:00:33,300 --&gt; 00:00:37,950
to be sacred or religious and so on, is
really Not the deeper thing going on.

12
00:00:37,950 --&gt; 00:00:40,620
There's much stronger forces, cosmic and
psychological,

13
00:00:40,620 --&gt; 00:00:44,240
and nationally operating, and this is very
strong

14
00:00:44,240 --&gt; 00:00:50,180
in another letter of his, letter 555, that
he goes into the much greater length.

15
00:00:51,530 --&gt; 00:00:56,870
So, this is his whole, acceptance of
secularism in a way.

16
00:00:56,870 --&gt; 00:00:59,460
which got him into a lot of trouble from
other Kabbalists,

17
00:00:59,460 --&gt; 00:01:02,660
generally from his contemporaries in the
Jewish world, traditional Jewish world.

18
00:01:03,860 --&gt; 00:01:05,900
So as I said, Rabbi Kook dies in 1935.

19
00:01:05,900 --&gt; 00:01:09,360
He does not see either the Holocaust, or
the establishment of a State of Israel.

20
00:01:10,390 --&gt; 00:01:14,520
After the Second World War, after the
Holocaust, mysticism general

21
00:01:14,520 --&gt; 00:01:16,930
and Jewish, who appear and then so on,
moves into

22
00:01:16,930 --&gt; 00:01:18,380
a new phase.

23
00:01:18,380 --&gt; 00:01:21,470
For a while, as I said, people do not have
time in the Second

24
00:01:21,470 --&gt; 00:01:24,820
World War, World War, in the Cold War to
be too occupied with mysticism.

25
00:01:26,190 --&gt; 00:01:28,920
In the 1960s is a big revival of
mysticism.

26
00:01:30,090 --&gt; 00:01:31,960
Of course, we know about the '60s in the
West, in the

27
00:01:31,960 --&gt; 00:01:35,040
United States, and elsewhere, the big

28
00:01:35,040 --&gt; 00:01:39,420
influx of Eastern psychology, of Eastern
mysticism.

29
00:01:39,420 --&gt; 00:01:42,460
Zen, Daoism, etc,

30
00:01:42,460 --&gt; 00:01:47,470
and Tibetian Buddhism, Tantra.
And this is part of the big youth

31
00:01:47,470 --&gt; 00:01:52,460
protest, social, and psychological,
physical, sexual, protest of the 1960s.

32
00:01:54,260 --&gt; 00:02:00,900
Now this is one big change, that from the
1960s, European mysticism, and

33
00:02:00,900 --&gt; 00:02:06,210
including Kabbalah Is more in contact with
the systems of the Far East.

34
00:02:07,390 --&gt; 00:02:11,130
And what was not relevant after this point
in the course, becomes more relevant now.

35
00:02:11,130 --&gt; 00:02:13,910
That people are beginning to respond more
and more to be more

36
00:02:13,910 --&gt; 00:02:17,500
familiar with it to respond to for reasons
the third great mystic

37
00:02:17,500 --&gt; 00:02:23,250
of the 20th Century that Ellev Wolfson has
diverged the important book to the Rabbi

38
00:02:23,250 --&gt; 00:02:29,730
the specific leader of Habad, it's
H-A-B-A-D or Lubavitch.

39
00:02:29,730 --&gt; 00:02:33,234
The Rabbi Menahem, Mendel

40
00:02:33,234 --&gt; 00:02:42,070
Schneerson, that's C-H, usually spelled
S-C-H-N-E-E-R-S-O-N

41
00:02:42,070 --&gt; 00:02:45,500
Menahem Mendel Schneerson responds
explicitly to the Eastern meditative

42
00:02:45,500 --&gt; 00:02:47,100
systems, and there's a search for what's

43
00:02:47,100 --&gt; 00:02:52,950
called &quot;Jewish meditation&quot; in the 1960s
and '70s.

44
00:02:52,950 --&gt; 00:02:56,170
And Kabbalists today are, are certainly
people who, to some extent, greater

45
00:02:56,170 --&gt; 00:02:58,520
or lesser, are familiar with the systems
of the Far East, and

46
00:02:58,520 --&gt; 00:03:00,580
in some way responding to them.

47
00:03:00,580 --&gt; 00:03:03,870
This is something which is not true of
Rabbi Kook and Rabbi Ashlag.

48
00:03:03,870 --&gt; 00:03:05,610
They write in very general, and I would

49
00:03:05,610 --&gt; 00:03:09,090
say probably misleading, terms about
Buddhism and so on.

50
00:03:09,090 --&gt; 00:03:11,320
There's much more of a familiarity today.

51
00:03:11,320 --&gt; 00:03:13,070
The average Kabbalist today has much more
of a

52
00:03:13,070 --&gt; 00:03:14,610
sense of what's going on in the Far East.

53
00:03:14,610 --&gt; 00:03:17,079
There's all kinds of books, and
translation in Hebrew and English.

54
00:03:18,330 --&gt; 00:03:20,070
And some of these people have practiced
and I know people

55
00:03:20,070 --&gt; 00:03:23,610
like that who've practiced various systems
of meditation and so on.

56
00:03:23,610 --&gt; 00:03:24,680
Not all of them were born in the

57
00:03:24,680 --&gt; 00:03:28,750
Orthodox world, so called Orthodox, the
traditional Jewish world.

58
00:03:28,750 --&gt; 00:03:33,590
So, this far more of I would say mixture
today between east and

59
00:03:33,590 --&gt; 00:03:37,340
west that have now met in the second part
of the 20th century.

60
00:03:38,890 --&gt; 00:03:42,430
Now, I want to focus on the mystical
revival of the 1960's, 1970's in Israel.

61
00:03:42,430 --&gt; 00:03:46,490
Because what happened is that Rabbi Kook's
school.

62
00:03:46,490 --&gt; 00:03:49,370
Of course, Rabbi Kook was an important
figure.

63
00:03:49,370 --&gt; 00:03:53,860
The first Ashkenazic.
That is European origin.

64
00:03:53,860 --&gt; 00:03:56,410
Jews of European origin.
That's Ashkenazim.

65
00:03:57,520 --&gt; 00:04:00,160
The first Ashkenazic chief rabbi of what

66
00:04:00,160 --&gt; 00:04:02,146
was then Palestine, under the British
mandate.

67
00:04:02,146 --&gt; 00:04:04,108
Important figure.

68
00:04:04,108 --&gt; 00:04:07,440
But nonetheless, his writings and his
thought

69
00:04:07,440 --&gt; 00:04:10,450
were really rediscovered in the late
1960s.

70
00:04:10,450 --&gt; 00:04:15,930
And when his son Rabbi Tzvi-Yehuda, that
is usually

71
00:04:15,930 --&gt; 00:04:24,940
spelled Zvi, and then Yehuda, Tzvi-Yehuda
Kook, his son, and other students of his.

72
00:04:24,940 --&gt; 00:04:26,380
Again, we're speaking about a circle,

73
00:04:26,380 --&gt; 00:04:29,120
like we spoke about earlier Kabbalistic
circles.

74
00:04:29,120 --&gt; 00:04:30,738
You've got a circle of people around Rabbi
Kook.

75
00:04:30,738 --&gt; 00:04:35,980
And Rabbi Zvi-Yehuda is an important
political figure in Rabbi Kook's school.

76
00:04:35,980 --&gt; 00:04:37,970
And he develops a whole network.

77
00:04:37,970 --&gt; 00:04:41,020
Of Yashivez, of places dedicated to
intense

78
00:04:41,020 --&gt; 00:04:46,310
study, and of educational institutions.
And very big political event.

79
00:04:46,310 --&gt; 00:04:49,470
Of course, not just the establishment of
state of Israel in

80
00:04:49,470 --&gt; 00:04:53,830
1948, but especially what some people call
the second republic of Israel.

81
00:04:53,830 --&gt; 00:04:57,120
It's a somewhat exaggerated term.
But there's a big change what happens.

82
00:04:58,310 --&gt; 00:05:02,210
In 1967 with a Six-Day War and

83
00:05:02,210 --&gt; 00:05:06,290
the extension of borders of Israeli
Dominion and

84
00:05:06,290 --&gt; 00:05:09,210
the military victory very much intensify

85
00:05:09,210 --&gt; 00:05:11,870
messianic hopes, amongst religious and
secular

86
00:05:11,870 --&gt; 00:05:15,340
Jews in Israel, they sensed that Israel
suddenly has a new security

87
00:05:15,340 --&gt; 00:05:21,040
as an expansion victory All these villains
short lived because in 1973,

88
00:05:21,040 --&gt; 00:05:25,040
there was almost the defeat in the
October, the Yom Kippur War.

89
00:05:25,040 --&gt; 00:05:29,190
However, in 67, there was this euphoria
and Rabbi Zvi-Yehuda is

90
00:05:29,190 --&gt; 00:05:32,020
part of this euphoria and his students are
part of this euphoria.

91
00:05:32,020 --&gt; 00:05:34,040
And they see, look here, Rabbi, Kook's
vision is fairly

92
00:05:34,040 --&gt; 00:05:37,230
coming true, not just the state of Israel
has been established

93
00:05:37,230 --&gt; 00:05:40,030
But we return into the ancestral homeland
of Judian [UNKNOWN]

94
00:05:40,030 --&gt; 00:05:43,580
of the West Bank and other places in the
greater land

95
00:05:43,580 --&gt; 00:05:46,030
of Israel and the state of Israel is
become much

96
00:05:46,030 --&gt; 00:05:49,190
more established, it's no longer and the
fate of extinction has

97
00:05:49,190 --&gt; 00:05:51,910
become more powerful what we are speaking
about is the powers

98
00:05:51,910 --&gt; 00:05:54,450
of the nation are really now manifested
himself and so on.

99
00:05:55,540 --&gt; 00:05:57,340
So There's

100
00:05:57,340 --&gt; 00:06:00,710
this big revival of Rabbi Kook's circle
and strengthening of

101
00:06:00,710 --&gt; 00:06:04,680
his circle in the late 60's, early 70's of
last century.

102
00:06:04,680 --&gt; 00:06:08,270
And it's moved into a political movement
with a certain political party.

103
00:06:08,270 --&gt; 00:06:11,470
I won't go into details, but becomes
influenced.

104
00:06:11,470 --&gt; 00:06:16,620
And after, even after the narrow defeat of
Yom Kippur of the October, '73 war.

105
00:06:16,620 --&gt; 00:06:18,960
So this movement becomes even stronger.

106
00:06:18,960 --&gt; 00:06:22,800
They say yes, secular designism has
failed, it hasn't let us far,

107
00:06:22,800 --&gt; 00:06:24,310
now we need to take over and become the

108
00:06:24,310 --&gt; 00:06:27,460
new avart-garge, to lead us forward, into
the promised

109
00:06:27,460 --&gt; 00:06:30,130
land, and of course the promised land is
the

110
00:06:30,130 --&gt; 00:06:36,862
settler movements, known as Gush Emunim,
that's G-U-S-H, E-M-U-N-I-M.

111
00:06:38,230 --&gt; 00:06:42,020
Now, the Gush Emunim movement found, at
some extent, by students of

112
00:06:42,020 --&gt; 00:06:47,630
Rabbi Kook not only, now develops a
network of settlements in their occupied

113
00:06:47,630 --&gt; 00:06:49,790
West Bank and Gaza and other places,

114
00:06:49,790 --&gt; 00:06:55,740
the Golan Heights, Sinai afterwards, and
Becomes very

115
00:06:55,740 --&gt; 00:06:57,680
much the center of a controversy, which is

116
00:06:57,680 --&gt; 00:07:00,120
still divided Israeli society over the
future of

117
00:07:00,120 --&gt; 00:07:04,230
occupied territories, and I won't go into
the politics of it, this is certainly not

118
00:07:04,230 --&gt; 00:07:06,510
an appropriate forum, but just to point at

119
00:07:06,510 --&gt; 00:07:11,460
how, this thinking gets deeply
nationalized and politicized.

120
00:07:11,460 --&gt; 00:07:12,360
And, this is what,

121
00:07:12,360 --&gt; 00:07:15,280
part of, one of the issues that I hinted
before at.

122
00:07:15,280 --&gt; 00:07:18,911
At how mysticism can become political
force as well.

123
00:07:18,911 --&gt; 00:07:21,830
