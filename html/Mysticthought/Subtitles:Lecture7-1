1
00:00:03,910 --&gt; 00:00:07,750
Before commencing with the seventh lesson,
I wanted to do

2
00:00:07,750 --&gt; 00:00:11,290
a bit of short revision, really, of the
first six lessons.

3
00:00:11,290 --&gt; 00:00:14,390
because the seventh lesson will be
reflected

4
00:00:14,390 --&gt; 00:00:16,000
more on the whole approach from the

5
00:00:16,000 --&gt; 00:00:18,630
fidelity of the course, and also
introducing

6
00:00:18,630 --&gt; 00:00:22,210
some new material, especially regarding
the contemporary period.

7
00:00:22,210 --&gt; 00:00:28,720
And now what I want to do is to really do
revision in,

8
00:00:28,720 --&gt; 00:00:31,390
in the true sense, because today in the
age of

9
00:00:31,390 --&gt; 00:00:34,600
the internet, it's very simple to do
revision in the

10
00:00:34,600 --&gt; 00:00:38,570
sense of merely repeating or remembering
the existing material, because

11
00:00:38,570 --&gt; 00:00:41,420
it's all filmed and one just has to look
at it.

12
00:00:41,420 --&gt; 00:00:43,430
But what I want to really is revision in
the sense

13
00:00:43,430 --&gt; 00:00:47,660
of looking at it again and reorganize and
restructuring and pointing

14
00:00:47,660 --&gt; 00:00:50,840
out all kinds of connections, which now
will become apparent after

15
00:00:50,840 --&gt; 00:00:54,170
all six classes, and this will also be
very, very good introduction

16
00:00:54,170 --&gt; 00:00:55,080
for the seventh lesson.

17
00:00:56,260 --&gt; 00:00:58,660
So I want to speak about the transition

18
00:00:58,660 --&gt; 00:01:01,110
which happens in the mystical experience
in general.

19
00:01:02,390 --&gt; 00:01:05,950
That the mystical experience, especially
in the

20
00:01:05,950 --&gt; 00:01:07,960
modern period, even before, but especially
in

21
00:01:07,960 --&gt; 00:01:13,730
the modern period, is described in terms
of moving from the outward to the inward.

22
00:01:13,730 --&gt; 00:01:18,540
That is from our everyday experience, from
our everyday perception of the world.

23
00:01:18,540 --&gt; 00:01:19,490
How every way they

24
00:01:19,490 --&gt; 00:01:23,770
contact, the way we perceive objects, the
way we perceive other people, the way

25
00:01:23,770 --&gt; 00:01:27,090
we perceive ourselves, our thoughts, our
feelings,

26
00:01:27,090 --&gt; 00:01:30,120
to a deeper more interior level, going

27
00:01:30,120 --&gt; 00:01:32,970
inside oneself, collecting oneself,
getting to the

28
00:01:32,970 --&gt; 00:01:35,870
center, however it's described, in order
to

29
00:01:37,510 --&gt; 00:01:44,330
quiet the, bustle and the hustle of the
external world and be more within self.

30
00:01:44,330 --&gt; 00:01:44,600
And then

31
00:01:44,600 --&gt; 00:01:45,500
one discovers depth.

32
00:01:46,570 --&gt; 00:01:50,460
Now I'll be speaking about literature a
lot in the seventh lesson.

33
00:01:50,460 --&gt; 00:01:57,210
I want to mention a very beautiful line by
an Israeli Hebrew poet Yona Walluch.

34
00:01:57,210 --&gt; 00:02:03,290
And she has this beautiful line, the
unconscious unfolds like a fan.

35
00:02:04,690 --&gt; 00:02:06,930
So, now Yona Wallach who was actually

36
00:02:06,930 --&gt; 00:02:10,350
influenced by Kaballah, and actually took
psychadelic

37
00:02:10,350 --&gt; 00:02:12,550
drugs as part of her therapy, legally
actually.

38
00:02:14,160 --&gt; 00:02:16,890
So Yona Wallach has really put it very
nicely, that the

39
00:02:16,890 --&gt; 00:02:20,580
deeper levels of a psyche unfold
themselves once one goes inside.

40
00:02:21,610 --&gt; 00:02:24,740
And now this is exactly the perception of
mystics, that things unfold themselves.

41
00:02:24,740 --&gt; 00:02:29,410
And that's why, not always, but often,
we've seen an emphasis on passivity, in

42
00:02:29,410 --&gt; 00:02:32,680
quietism, in Hesychasm to some extent, in

43
00:02:32,680 --&gt; 00:02:35,820
Hasidism, that, one doesn't have to do
much.

44
00:02:35,820 --&gt; 00:02:38,850
One needs the initial effort of breaking
away from the distraction

45
00:02:38,850 --&gt; 00:02:42,510
of the external world, and going to a
quieter place inside.

46
00:02:42,510 --&gt; 00:02:47,850
But once that happens, then the fins
unfold, almost by themselves.

47
00:02:47,850 --&gt; 00:02:50,760
Of course, God is also in the picture, but
from a psychological

48
00:02:50,760 --&gt; 00:02:52,170
point of view, it's experienced as

49
00:02:52,170 --&gt; 00:02:56,930
a spontaneous occurrence, rather than
contrived.

50
00:02:56,930 --&gt; 00:03:01,240
Now in this unfolding we've already got
three concepts.

51
00:03:01,240 --&gt; 00:03:04,110
We've got the concept of passivity,
spontaneity.

52
00:03:04,110 --&gt; 00:03:07,370
Of inerreality, and of depth, of going
deeper.

53
00:03:07,370 --&gt; 00:03:11,670
And these are themes, themes which have
recurred, throughout the six lessons.

54
00:03:11,670 --&gt; 00:03:13,150
Now what happens after that point?

55
00:03:14,510 --&gt; 00:03:16,540
And here I want to refer you to one of

56
00:03:16,540 --&gt; 00:03:19,530
the suggested readings to my discussion of
shamanism and shamanic

57
00:03:19,530 --&gt; 00:03:22,670
trance and modern Kabbalah, because there
I point at a

58
00:03:22,670 --&gt; 00:03:26,574
certain cluster of occurrences that can be
described as shamanic, and

59
00:03:26,574 --&gt; 00:03:30,640
I want to speak afterwards about a second
cluster of occurrences.

60
00:03:30,640 --&gt; 00:03:33,496
So the first set of things that can happen

61
00:03:33,496 --&gt; 00:03:38,510
is that in this, unfolding a mythical
geography opens up.

62
00:03:38,510 --&gt; 00:03:42,710
There is a whole world, the inner world is
literally, there's a whole world

63
00:03:42,710 --&gt; 00:03:44,600
which has its own worldliness to use

64
00:03:44,600 --&gt; 00:03:47,770
a term from philosophy, from 20th century
philosophy.

65
00:03:47,770 --&gt; 00:03:52,960
It opens up almost like interior space, so
the interior geography.

66
00:03:52,960 --&gt; 00:03:54,820
And this is one of Freud's interesting
insights that

67
00:03:54,820 --&gt; 00:03:57,980
he says that the unconscious has a
topographical structure.

68
00:03:57,980 --&gt; 00:04:03,340
It's structured like a country, like a
land, almost, with regions, with zones.

69
00:04:03,340 --&gt; 00:04:05,340
And what happens inside this mystical
geography?

70
00:04:06,475 --&gt; 00:04:08,940
There's an experience first of all of
transformation.

71
00:04:10,560 --&gt; 00:04:14,760
And now the idea of transformation is a
strong theme in

72
00:04:14,760 --&gt; 00:04:18,090
psychoanalytical writing, and it's also a
strong theme in other forms

73
00:04:18,090 --&gt; 00:04:20,500
of psychology that I'll mention soon.

74
00:04:20,500 --&gt; 00:04:22,820
And Betty Joseph, who I've mentioned
before,

75
00:04:22,820 --&gt; 00:04:26,780
has mentioned, put it very nicely, psychic
change.

76
00:04:26,780 --&gt; 00:04:30,780
Not change of one's external life, but a
change inside the psyche.

77
00:04:30,780 --&gt; 00:04:35,060
So we're not speaking here about change in
the external religious sense let's say,

78
00:04:35,060 --&gt; 00:04:37,180
or becoming more punctillious and more
careful

79
00:04:37,180 --&gt; 00:04:39,720
about observation of these or that laws.

80
00:04:39,720 --&gt; 00:04:43,028
Doesn't have to be an antinomian
direction, but it's often anomian.

81
00:04:43,028 --&gt; 00:04:46,566
Because it's not about observance in the
external world, and it's not

82
00:04:46,566 --&gt; 00:04:51,260
external change in the sense of behavior
psychology or changing one's behavior.

83
00:04:51,260 --&gt; 00:04:53,340
Or coaching, which is very popular today.

84
00:04:53,340 --&gt; 00:04:55,600
Changing how one manages one's life on an

85
00:04:55,600 --&gt; 00:04:59,430
outer level, with some connection to the
inner level.

86
00:04:59,430 --&gt; 00:05:01,580
It depends what kind of coaching.

87
00:05:01,580 --&gt; 00:05:04,070
What we're speaking about, especially in
psychoanalysis,

88
00:05:04,070 --&gt; 00:05:06,690
is a deeper process of psychic change.

89
00:05:07,950 --&gt; 00:05:10,970
And the mystics, I think, are also
speaking about transformation, in

90
00:05:10,970 --&gt; 00:05:14,330
the sense of psychic change, of changing
the structure of a psyche.

91
00:05:15,480 --&gt; 00:05:17,990
Now, how does this manifest itself?

92
00:05:17,990 --&gt; 00:05:20,010
One of these changes is that of
empowerment.

93
00:05:21,150 --&gt; 00:05:23,380
That is to say, even in the first lecture,
the

94
00:05:23,380 --&gt; 00:05:28,195
mind, the psyche, how in the world we
become more powerful.

95
00:05:28,195 --&gt; 00:05:32,660
We're able to achieve things which are not
achievable in the ordinary external sense.

96
00:05:32,660 --&gt; 00:05:35,574
They're achievable through the power of
the mind, the

97
00:05:35,574 --&gt; 00:05:38,347
power of thinking, the power of the soul
et cetera.

98
00:05:38,347 --&gt; 00:05:41,777
So that's one thing which happens which is
this theme of empowerment.

99
00:05:41,777 --&gt; 00:05:44,049
Now, all along we've been noting how

100
00:05:44,049 --&gt; 00:05:46,605
mysticism branches off or opens up to
other

101
00:05:46,605 --&gt; 00:05:49,161
avenues of humanity as a social sciences,

102
00:05:49,161 --&gt; 00:05:52,100
we'll be speaking as I said about
literature.

103
00:05:52,100 --&gt; 00:05:54,130
We already did a bit of that today.

104
00:05:54,130 --&gt; 00:05:57,660
And of course the political social realm
has very much to do with power,

105
00:05:57,660 --&gt; 00:05:59,165
with change.

106
00:05:59,165 --&gt; 00:06:01,398
It's one of the key themes of politics in
the modern era,

107
00:06:01,398 --&gt; 00:06:05,510
the idea that politics is about change but
you have revolution, even.

108
00:06:05,510 --&gt; 00:06:08,420
Because in the medieval period in
feudalist system

109
00:06:08,420 --&gt; 00:06:11,380
politics is about preservation of a
certain structure.

110
00:06:11,380 --&gt; 00:06:13,510
In the modern period, it's, we see the

111
00:06:13,510 --&gt; 00:06:16,965
popularity of, of a political platform
based on change.

112
00:06:16,965 --&gt; 00:06:20,220
Because it's not that they aren't
conservative platforms, but we see that

113
00:06:20,220 --&gt; 00:06:23,000
it has a certain power, a certain
attraction, this idea of change,

114
00:06:23,000 --&gt; 00:06:27,030
as evidenced by the revolutions, the
French, American, Russian revolution.

115
00:06:27,030 --&gt; 00:06:28,440
The idea of modernity is the idea of

116
00:06:28,440 --&gt; 00:06:32,650
change, of constant transition, of
constant transformation and development.

117
00:06:32,650 --&gt; 00:06:36,935
And modern psychology include in modern
mystical psychology echo this.

118
00:06:36,935 --&gt; 00:06:39,530
There's a strong focus on transformation
on

119
00:06:39,530 --&gt; 00:06:41,990
becoming different and being reborn, et
cetera.

120
00:06:43,510 --&gt; 00:06:48,360
So, and one of these directions, again,
very political, is that of empowerment,

121
00:06:48,360 --&gt; 00:06:51,321
the theme of power as Foccault has noted,
there's a very strong

122
00:06:51,321 --&gt; 00:06:54,930
a theme in modernity and the changes of
the direction of empowerment.

123
00:06:54,930 --&gt; 00:06:57,370
It could be individual empowerment, or it
could be

124
00:06:57,370 --&gt; 00:06:59,710
as in the case of Rabbi Cook, collective
empowerment.

125
00:07:01,390 --&gt; 00:07:06,570
Now, inside this transformation, there's
a, a very

126
00:07:06,570 --&gt; 00:07:09,210
interesting relationship between internal
figures, which is something which

127
00:07:09,210 --&gt; 00:07:12,160
we haven't spoken about a lot, and I want
to really zoom in on it at the moment.

128
00:07:13,240 --&gt; 00:07:13,590
That there's

129
00:07:13,590 --&gt; 00:07:16,250
a very interesting book which just came
out.

130
00:07:16,250 --&gt; 00:07:19,390
By somebody who's associated with James
Hillman, Michael

131
00:07:19,390 --&gt; 00:07:21,650
Vannoy Adams from New York, he wrote a

132
00:07:21,650 --&gt; 00:07:25,020
book, For The Love of Imagination, which
is

133
00:07:25,020 --&gt; 00:07:30,630
a very interesting Hillmanian, psych,
Jungian kind of approach.

134
00:07:30,630 --&gt; 00:07:34,750
And he writes there about the, what
happens when one begins, the

135
00:07:34,750 --&gt; 00:07:39,130
ego, our usual self, begins to go through
a process of transformation

136
00:07:39,130 --&gt; 00:07:42,920
of its attitude to non-ego figures in the
inner world.

137
00:07:42,920 --&gt; 00:07:46,200
That is the inner world is like a theater,
it has its own drama.

138
00:07:46,200 --&gt; 00:07:50,520
It's populated by personas, it's populated
by all kinds of images, by all kinds

139
00:07:50,520 --&gt; 00:07:54,959
of figures that one engages in dialogue
just like Jung did in his red book.

140
00:07:54,959 --&gt; 00:07:58,050
This is one of his sources in Jungian
psychology.

141
00:07:58,050 --&gt; 00:07:59,540
And this often happens with mystics.

142
00:07:59,540 --&gt; 00:08:02,610
The idea that one begins to discover
internal figures.

143
00:08:03,730 --&gt; 00:08:04,090
Now,

144
00:08:04,090 --&gt; 00:08:05,260
what are the internal figures?

145
00:08:06,520 --&gt; 00:08:11,050
So, in a purely secular sense, we have
psychological systems that are based on

146
00:08:11,050 --&gt; 00:08:13,540
dialog with these internal figures, the
whole

147
00:08:13,540 --&gt; 00:08:15,840
idea of what's called talking to inner
parts.

148
00:08:15,840 --&gt; 00:08:19,400
Which we'll find in Gestalt Psychology,
and we find it in NLP.

149
00:08:19,400 --&gt; 00:08:24,030
And by the way, NLP, or Neuro-Linguistic
Programming, at it's best,

150
00:08:24,030 --&gt; 00:08:27,520
is what's called a modeling of the
hypnotic system of Milton Erickson.

151
00:08:27,520 --&gt; 00:08:29,350
So obviously, if it's not

152
00:08:29,350 --&gt; 00:08:33,180
combined with deep work in trance, it's
not very effective or meaningful.

153
00:08:33,180 --&gt; 00:08:34,380
If it is, as in the case of

154
00:08:34,380 --&gt; 00:08:38,960
Erickson, combined with trance work then,
it's something different.

155
00:08:38,960 --&gt; 00:08:42,570
So, we've got this whole idea of talking
to internal figures.

156
00:08:42,570 --&gt; 00:08:49,930
Now, the mystical approach focuses on
various internal figures,

157
00:08:49,930 --&gt; 00:08:54,390
but especially it begins to speak about a
different population of our inner world,

158
00:08:54,390 --&gt; 00:08:57,520
and here the heart and soul become
important

159
00:08:57,520 --&gt; 00:08:59,840
players, because one of the goals of
mystical

160
00:08:59,840 --&gt; 00:09:03,220
experience in modern mystical psychology,
is to have

161
00:09:03,220 --&gt; 00:09:06,450
a stronger experience of the reality of
the soul.

162
00:09:06,450 --&gt; 00:09:09,380
A stronger experience of the reality of
the heart.

163
00:09:09,380 --&gt; 00:09:13,660
That is centers of the inner world or the
psychic centers as

164
00:09:13,660 --&gt; 00:09:17,960
I spoke in the context let's say of
hesychasm, become far more prominent.

165
00:09:17,960 --&gt; 00:09:19,430
And now I'm not going to,

166
00:09:19,430 --&gt; 00:09:21,130
we'll speak about it in the seventh

167
00:09:21,130 --&gt; 00:09:23,290
lesson, the question of definitions of a
soul.

168
00:09:23,290 --&gt; 00:09:25,180
I want to point to the plurality of a
soul.

169
00:09:25,180 --&gt; 00:09:27,620
This is a great principle for James
Hillman.

170
00:09:27,620 --&gt; 00:09:30,250
The soul is not one thing.
It has many parts.

171
00:09:30,250 --&gt; 00:09:32,410
In Hasidism, we speak about two souls, the
more

172
00:09:32,410 --&gt; 00:09:35,840
divine one and the more earthy, animal
one, maybe.

173
00:09:35,840 --&gt; 00:09:38,600
The, the soul has many levels in Kabbalah.

174
00:09:38,600 --&gt; 00:09:42,180
And in other systems, we also find this
idea of the plurality of a soul.

175
00:09:42,180 --&gt; 00:09:44,580
And for Islamic mysticism, which we
haven't spoken

176
00:09:44,580 --&gt; 00:09:48,420
about much, in Sufism, we speak about
different parts of the heart.

177
00:09:48,420 --&gt; 00:09:52,450
More secret, more inward parts of the
heart, more outward parts.

178
00:09:52,450 --&gt; 00:09:55,000
So the heart and soul become stronger
players in one's inner

179
00:09:55,000 --&gt; 00:10:00,110
life, with all of the plurality, and with
all of their complexity.

180
00:10:00,110 --&gt; 00:10:05,360
So I want to really focus on this idea
that plurality and complexity are part of

181
00:10:05,360 --&gt; 00:10:07,290
the unfolding of the unconscious, that is,
the

182
00:10:07,290 --&gt; 00:10:09,940
external world from a mystical point of
view is

183
00:10:09,940 --&gt; 00:10:13,580
what one great social critic, Makuza,
called one-dimensional man.

184
00:10:13,580 --&gt; 00:10:16,910
Today, we'd have to say one-dimensional
person, because this happens

185
00:10:16,910 --&gt; 00:10:19,140
to women just as much as it happens to
men.

186
00:10:19,140 --&gt; 00:10:21,440
But there's a, there's a certain
flattening out,

187
00:10:21,440 --&gt; 00:10:23,970
that's an effort to use in 20th century
philosophy.

188
00:10:23,970 --&gt; 00:10:27,270
A certain leveling of the, the world
becomes

189
00:10:27,270 --&gt; 00:10:29,745
less rich from a world which is many

190
00:10:29,745 --&gt; 00:10:32,510
layered, which has many realms and so on

191
00:10:32,510 --&gt; 00:10:35,048
with the only the external realm with
what's observable

192
00:10:35,048 --&gt; 00:10:37,688
by the sense, the world of empiricism so
to speak.

193
00:10:37,688 --&gt; 00:10:41,070
And then through going inward, one
discovers a different world.

194
00:10:41,070 --&gt; 00:10:44,870
A more complex, a richer world in which
it's populated, as I said, it

195
00:10:44,870 --&gt; 00:10:49,030
has its own geography, and it's also, it's
got its own population, so to speak.

196
00:10:49,030 --&gt; 00:10:53,460
It's populated by all these internal
figures that one can engage in dialogue.

197
00:10:53,460 --&gt; 00:10:57,160
And, two of the central figures here are
the heart and the soul.

198
00:10:57,160 --&gt; 00:11:00,370
Now, in concluding this section, I just
want to speak

199
00:11:00,370 --&gt; 00:11:04,090
a, a bit about the, the place of God in
this whole scheme, that

200
00:11:06,550 --&gt; 00:11:09,410
obviously, mysticism, to the extent that
it's religious.

201
00:11:09,410 --&gt; 00:11:11,470
And I, I'll be speaking in the seventh
lesson about

202
00:11:11,470 --&gt; 00:11:14,830
the places where mysticism departs from
religion to some extent.

203
00:11:14,830 --&gt; 00:11:17,770
And the idea of antinomianism that we're
speaking about, of going against

204
00:11:17,770 --&gt; 00:11:21,910
the nomos, or critiquing the nomos, the
law is also related to this.

205
00:11:21,910 --&gt; 00:11:25,950
That mysticism has points of conflict with
organized,

206
00:11:25,950 --&gt; 00:11:29,530
established religion, which gets stronger
in the 20th century.

207
00:11:29,530 --&gt; 00:11:32,200
However, to a large extent, mysticism is
nomial.

208
00:11:32,200 --&gt; 00:11:36,210
It's part of the religious structure.
So where is God in all of this?

209
00:11:36,210 --&gt; 00:11:38,070
Now it's very interesting that the
mystical

210
00:11:38,070 --&gt; 00:11:40,070
approach says that, the more one goes

211
00:11:40,070 --&gt; 00:11:42,360
inwards, the more one goes deep inside,

212
00:11:42,360 --&gt; 00:11:44,360
the more one goes through this
transformation,

213
00:11:44,360 --&gt; 00:11:46,420
the more one discovers the unfolding of

214
00:11:46,420 --&gt; 00:11:48,700
the topography and geography and the
internal

215
00:11:48,700 --&gt; 00:11:52,650
figures and so on and so forth, that's a
place where one discovers God.

216
00:11:52,650 --&gt; 00:11:55,250
That is, there are mystical approaches,
we've spoken

217
00:11:55,250 --&gt; 00:11:57,220
about this, that speak about seeing God in

218
00:11:57,220 --&gt; 00:12:00,280
the external world, seeing God in
political life,

219
00:12:00,280 --&gt; 00:12:02,510
seeing God in social life, seeing God of

220
00:12:02,510 --&gt; 00:12:05,970
the natural world, however, for mystical
psychology one

221
00:12:05,970 --&gt; 00:12:08,620
finds God by going deep inside one's self.

222
00:12:08,620 --&gt; 00:12:10,330
God is more in the heart.

223
00:12:10,330 --&gt; 00:12:12,950
And this is a, a very old message, going
all the way back

224
00:12:12,950 --&gt; 00:12:16,350
to the Bible, that God can be find in,
found inside the heart.

225
00:12:16,350 --&gt; 00:12:19,710
And the modern mystics very much developed
the idea of a divine soul.

226
00:12:19,710 --&gt; 00:12:22,460
Mystics both East and West speak about the
divinity

227
00:12:22,460 --&gt; 00:12:24,770
of the soul as a divine part of us

228
00:12:24,770 --&gt; 00:12:26,850
which can be found by going deeper inside
the soul.
