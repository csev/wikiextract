1
00:00:00,710 --&gt; 00:00:05,150
We've spoken about Rabbi Kook's school,
Rabbi Ashlag's school, I

2
00:00:05,150 --&gt; 00:00:08,628
want to stress that, the citizen also gets
strong after

3
00:00:08,628 --&gt; 00:00:13,142
the 2nd World War, about Ludovich that I
mentioned, re-established

4
00:00:13,142 --&gt; 00:00:16,799
himself in America, in the United States,
in New York.

5
00:00:16,799 --&gt; 00:00:21,500
So then we're speaking about 2 centers
after 2nd world war.

6
00:00:21,500 --&gt; 00:00:24,600
Because of the Holocaust, the European
center is much weaker.

7
00:00:24,600 --&gt; 00:00:25,710
Not much left of mysticisms

8
00:00:25,710 --&gt; 00:00:26,960
in Europe.

9
00:00:26,960 --&gt; 00:00:29,068
So, we're not really speaking any more

10
00:00:29,068 --&gt; 00:00:33,030
about European mysticism, but maybe
post-European mysticism.

11
00:00:33,030 --&gt; 00:00:36,790
People of European origin or schools of
European, European origin.

12
00:00:36,790 --&gt; 00:00:38,845
People like Lubavitcher Rebbe.

13
00:00:38,845 --&gt; 00:00:44,310
Re-establishing themselves on new shores,
the American Center in the United States.

14
00:00:44,310 --&gt; 00:00:47,940
We spoke about the 60s, how it fueled this
movement, Chabads.

15
00:00:49,580 --&gt; 00:00:51,100
The absorption

16
00:00:51,100 --&gt; 00:00:54,210
of the certain parts of Ashlag's school
have popularized

17
00:00:54,210 --&gt; 00:00:58,420
themselves in the West, in Europe, in the
United States.

18
00:00:58,420 --&gt; 00:01:02,352
The Ashlag school also has strong
following in other parts of Europe.

19
00:01:02,352 --&gt; 00:01:05,710
And also United States, of course, with
Laitman

20
00:01:05,710 --&gt; 00:01:08,060
and the Kabbalah Center in the United
States,

21
00:01:08,060 --&gt; 00:01:09,460
even though, for me, it's really beyond
the

22
00:01:09,460 --&gt; 00:01:12,150
borders of, what I would properly call
Kabbalah.

23
00:01:13,480 --&gt; 00:01:13,980
And

24
00:01:15,760 --&gt; 00:01:19,480
we also see other movements outside what's
called the Orthodox World.

25
00:01:19,480 --&gt; 00:01:20,876
We have a Jewish renewal movement.

26
00:01:20,876 --&gt; 00:01:26,850
People like, Zalman Schachter, who
established the Jewish Renewal Movement.

27
00:01:27,910 --&gt; 00:01:29,170
Which grows out of Habad in a

28
00:01:29,170 --&gt; 00:01:34,040
way, and becomes non-orthodox, much more
universalistic,

29
00:01:34,040 --&gt; 00:01:36,280
much more mixed in with Eastern mysticism,

30
00:01:36,280 --&gt; 00:01:38,714
with Sufism, even a bit of Christian
mysticism.

31
00:01:39,810 --&gt; 00:01:41,320
Students turning to the United States,

32
00:01:41,320 --&gt; 00:01:44,010
beginning to move in Israel as well, from
the United States.

33
00:01:45,280 --&gt; 00:01:48,640
That's another development in the 2nd part
of the 20th century.

34
00:01:48,640 --&gt; 00:01:50,580
Very much a 60s kind of development.

35
00:01:51,640 --&gt; 00:01:55,345
We spoke about, the 70s, 80s, the high
Gush Emunim movement

36
00:01:55,345 --&gt; 00:02:00,040
of Rabbi Kook's Circle became much weaker,
a series of political defeats.

37
00:02:00,040 --&gt; 00:02:05,530
1982 the evacuation of Sinai, 2005 the
evacuation of Gaza,

38
00:02:06,670 --&gt; 00:02:12,380
and for even 90s evacuation of certain
parts of Judea and Samaria over West Bank.

39
00:02:12,380 --&gt; 00:02:17,550
So this movement still a force in Israeli
politics, but not like it used to be.

40
00:02:17,550 --&gt; 00:02:20,260
And not coincidentally, the interest of
Kook

41
00:02:20,260 --&gt; 00:02:22,700
is shifted from the political, the
national.

42
00:02:22,700 --&gt; 00:02:27,710
Especially after the death of his son in
1982, also of rabbi Feuda.

43
00:02:27,710 --&gt; 00:02:29,660
Focused today is far more on the
individual.

44
00:02:30,800 --&gt; 00:02:31,680
On individual self

45
00:02:31,680 --&gt; 00:02:34,460
discovery, in the spirit of a new age.

46
00:02:34,460 --&gt; 00:02:38,880
In the spirit of contemporary mysticism
that will speak about in the 7th lesson.

47
00:02:38,880 --&gt; 00:02:41,970
This far more focus on Rabbi Kook's
diaries, on

48
00:02:41,970 --&gt; 00:02:46,300
his teachings about positive psychology
and individual self confidence.

49
00:02:48,060 --&gt; 00:02:51,310
So this is what's happening today with the
legacy of Rabbi Kook.

50
00:02:51,310 --&gt; 00:02:54,050
Now striking development in the late 20th
century, and this

51
00:02:54,050 --&gt; 00:02:56,830
will be the last part of this lesson, is
the

52
00:02:56,830 --&gt; 00:03:01,990
development of what's called In my view,
incorrectly, the Ultra-Orthodoox world, or

53
00:03:01,990 --&gt; 00:03:05,110
the Haredi world, that is today not one
world, but many worlds.

54
00:03:06,130 --&gt; 00:03:09,000
One of them is the ongoing strength of the

55
00:03:09,000 --&gt; 00:03:12,870
Hasidic world, the vocabulary of Habad
that have developed the

56
00:03:12,870 --&gt; 00:03:17,270
entire network of mysteries around the
world, of representatives

57
00:03:17,270 --&gt; 00:03:22,540
all over the world, of unimaginable,
far-out places in Himalaya

58
00:03:22,540 --&gt; 00:03:27,854
the no, the Australian desert, wherever.
practically, all of the world.

59
00:03:27,854 --&gt; 00:03:30,890
[INAUDIBLE] one writer called The Rebbe's
Army, spread out

60
00:03:30,890 --&gt; 00:03:33,940
throughout the world winning the message,
the mystical message.

61
00:03:33,940 --&gt; 00:03:36,080
Some are thwarted down, some are
popularized of

62
00:03:36,080 --&gt; 00:03:38,960
Habad, which is deeply psychological in
its thinking.

63
00:03:40,470 --&gt; 00:03:42,710
And it'll be discussed, hopefully, in a
book

64
00:03:42,710 --&gt; 00:03:44,735
that I've devoted to the soul and
Kabbalah.

65
00:03:44,735 --&gt; 00:03:46,970
I'll go into that in more length.

66
00:03:46,970 --&gt; 00:03:48,272
Now, a movement

67
00:03:48,272 --&gt; 00:03:53,387
which was marginal in early Hasidism
becomes much stronger in the

68
00:03:53,387 --&gt; 00:03:59,120
2nd part of the 20th century, Braslav,
that is, BRASLAV.

69
00:03:59,120 --&gt; 00:04:02,380
Mystical genius Rabbi Nachman of Braslav,
his teachings are

70
00:04:02,380 --&gt; 00:04:06,240
very popular today, and other sects of the
Hasidic world,

71
00:04:06,240 --&gt; 00:04:10,240
other Hasidic teachers in Jerusalem, some
of whom I've

72
00:04:10,240 --&gt; 00:04:15,160
been in contact with, are really making
the Hasidic message

73
00:04:15,160 --&gt; 00:04:17,730
more vital I would say, new teachings,

74
00:04:17,730 --&gt; 00:04:21,880
interesting teachings, stronger focus and
mystical practices.

75
00:04:21,880 --&gt; 00:04:24,550
It's all going strong in Jerusalem, and
elsewhere.

76
00:04:26,670 --&gt; 00:04:30,910
So, the Israeli new age begins in the
1990s.

77
00:04:30,910 --&gt; 00:04:34,110
There's a strong interest in Kabaalah as
part of a new age,

78
00:04:34,110 --&gt; 00:04:35,966
mixed together to some extent with

79
00:04:35,966 --&gt; 00:04:39,990
eastern systems, with western
psychological techniques.

80
00:04:39,990 --&gt; 00:04:40,875
Things which are, well, we

81
00:04:40,875 --&gt; 00:04:44,220
want to call alternative healing,
alternative psychology,

82
00:04:45,540 --&gt; 00:04:48,530
various forms of psychological self worth,

83
00:04:48,530 --&gt; 00:04:51,890
self development, humanistic psychology
becomes popular.

84
00:04:51,890 --&gt; 00:04:56,090
Positive psychology as I've mentioned,
trans-personal psychology.

85
00:04:56,090 --&gt; 00:05:00,500
All this gets part of this big mix that
I'll speak about of the New Age.

86
00:05:00,500 --&gt; 00:05:04,950
In the second, towards the end of the 20th
Century, early 21st Century.

87
00:05:04,950 --&gt; 00:05:09,200
However, one must remember that the
fastest growing

88
00:05:09,200 --&gt; 00:05:12,270
demographically and in some way culturally
force in

89
00:05:12,270 --&gt; 00:05:15,090
Israeli society today, which is very much
now

90
00:05:15,090 --&gt; 00:05:17,390
the center of the public debate in Israel,

91
00:05:17,390 --&gt; 00:05:22,100
is the Haredi World, the so called
ultra-Orthodox world.

92
00:05:22,100 --&gt; 00:05:25,970
The whole world of the Hasidim, the world
of the Lithuanian Yeshivas, the

93
00:05:25,970 --&gt; 00:05:32,450
school of Rabbi Kramer, the Mussar school,
which is also has a certain revival.

94
00:05:32,450 --&gt; 00:05:38,600
This is often largely due to the work of
my own first teacher, Rabbi Wolbe, Wolbe.

95
00:05:39,790 --&gt; 00:05:42,220
All this is reviving at the moment.

96
00:05:42,220 --&gt; 00:05:44,110
And the Haredi world is getting larger

97
00:05:44,110 --&gt; 00:05:46,960
because of very large families, and low
marriage,

98
00:05:46,960 --&gt; 00:05:52,390
people getting married very early, even
before 20,

99
00:05:52,390 --&gt; 00:05:55,560
and large families of 6, 8, 10 children.

100
00:05:55,560 --&gt; 00:05:57,190
So the Haredi world is numerically

101
00:05:57,190 --&gt; 00:06:00,980
expanding, is developing far more
self-confidence as

102
00:06:00,980 --&gt; 00:06:05,680
a certain political force, which comes and
goes, but 1st certainly a cultural force.

103
00:06:05,680 --&gt; 00:06:07,350
And Kabbalah is

104
00:06:07,350 --&gt; 00:06:09,500
become stronger as part of this.

105
00:06:09,500 --&gt; 00:06:11,110
So we speaking about the development of

106
00:06:11,110 --&gt; 00:06:14,590
an entire network of Kabbalistic Yeshivas
today,

107
00:06:14,590 --&gt; 00:06:17,900
in Jerusalem, in other places in Israel,
to some extent even in New York.

108
00:06:19,040 --&gt; 00:06:20,720
All forms of Kabbalah are being developed.

109
00:06:20,720 --&gt; 00:06:25,490
The Kabbalah of Lutsato, of Rabsharabi, of
Rab Kaimer, of Cidism.

110
00:06:25,490 --&gt; 00:06:29,980
New forth, forms of Kabbalistic thought,
new forms of Kabbalistic psychology.

111
00:06:29,980 --&gt; 00:06:32,880
To some extent, a lot of psychological
writing,

112
00:06:32,880 --&gt; 00:06:37,380
a lot of books about psychological issues
about the soul, about the heart.

113
00:06:37,380 --&gt; 00:06:40,420
To some extent, in dialogue with Western
psychology, critical

114
00:06:40,420 --&gt; 00:06:44,020
of Western psychology, yet in dialogue
with Western psychology.

115
00:06:44,020 --&gt; 00:06:47,630
Rabbi Wolbe himself that I mentioned, he
studied psychology.

116
00:06:47,630 --&gt; 00:06:51,440
In academic setting, just like for
Lubavitch, who had also went to

117
00:06:51,440 --&gt; 00:06:58,422
university, to Sorbonne, and others.
People coming in, maybe 120, maybe 150,000

118
00:06:58,422 --&gt; 00:07:00,790
people, used to be secular, have now

119
00:07:00,790 --&gt; 00:07:06,290
have become observant or traditional Jews,
so-called Orthodox.

120
00:07:06,290 --&gt; 00:07:08,740
And this also brings in new ideas, more

121
00:07:08,740 --&gt; 00:07:12,280
exposure to Far East, more exposure to
Western psychology.

122
00:07:12,280 --&gt; 00:07:15,440
And all this is very, very exciting, a
very creative moment, really

123
00:07:15,440 --&gt; 00:07:21,060
a laboratory of religious ferment, of
development of new forms of Kabbalah.

124
00:07:21,060 --&gt; 00:07:24,470
So Kabbalah is really not

125
00:07:24,470 --&gt; 00:07:28,470
an archaeological record, and not merely
historical

126
00:07:28,470 --&gt; 00:07:32,280
record, but a vibrant force in Israeli
society.

127
00:07:32,280 --&gt; 00:07:36,410
Was won elections in 1996, Netanyahu, the
current

128
00:07:36,410 --&gt; 00:07:38,380
prime minister, it's not his first term,
he

129
00:07:38,380 --&gt; 00:07:41,160
never would have won the election, partly
because

130
00:07:41,160 --&gt; 00:07:46,100
the blessing of a Kabulist, Rabbi Kauduli,
that's KADURI.

131
00:07:46,100 --&gt; 00:07:49,860
Since they all Kabulists since then has
moved on.

132
00:07:49,860 --&gt; 00:07:51,440
And, so we see it's a force in

133
00:07:51,440 --&gt; 00:07:54,330
Israeli society, in Israeli politics, in
the Jewish

134
00:07:54,330 --&gt; 00:07:57,070
world today, in the Jewish renewal, other
forms

135
00:07:57,070 --&gt; 00:07:59,210
of Jewish life in the United States, and
elsewhere.

136
00:08:00,558 --&gt; 00:08:04,560
All part of really, a very vibrant
history.

137
00:08:04,560 --&gt; 00:08:06,660
Which still needs to be explored, and what
needs to be

138
00:08:06,660 --&gt; 00:08:09,130
followed, which is part of what I'm doing
for field work,

139
00:08:09,130 --&gt; 00:08:12,500
for meeting of Kabbalah studied of him
following the text that

140
00:08:12,500 --&gt; 00:08:15,230
have been written and being published
today, the things that are being

141
00:08:15,230 --&gt; 00:08:16,670
posted on the Internet.

142
00:08:16,670 --&gt; 00:08:18,585
A lot of people like Boaz Huss in

143
00:08:18,585 --&gt; 00:08:21,955
[UNKNOWN] university that H-U-S-S are also
working in this

144
00:08:21,955 --&gt; 00:08:24,280
direction, of really trying to keep our
finger
