1
00:00:00,370 --&gt; 00:00:03,000
So now we're going to move into the 20th
century.

2
00:00:03,000 --&gt; 00:00:05,760
Now there's all kind of interesting things
that happened in the 19th century,

3
00:00:05,760 --&gt; 00:00:11,950
and there were various aesthetic movements
of people of God what were called, who

4
00:00:11,950 --&gt; 00:00:13,730
had this sort of burning ecstasy

5
00:00:13,730 --&gt; 00:00:16,410
and dances, very reminiscent of Hasidism
really,

6
00:00:16,410 --&gt; 00:00:18,320
which again continued to develop in 19th

7
00:00:18,320 --&gt; 00:00:20,139
century Russia and Romania, the same
areas.

8
00:00:21,210 --&gt; 00:00:24,180
So we really speak about two movements
developing in the same areas.

9
00:00:24,180 --&gt; 00:00:27,110
How much contact there was is an
interesting question.

10
00:00:27,110 --&gt; 00:00:28,670
And we discuss that.

11
00:00:28,670 --&gt; 00:00:30,360
Now I want to speak about what happens

12
00:00:30,360 --&gt; 00:00:33,200
in the 20th century because three
different developments here.

13
00:00:33,200 --&gt; 00:00:35,660
And we spoke about this in the context of

14
00:00:35,660 --&gt; 00:00:37,760
Kaballah, but we look at now from this
angle.

15
00:00:38,790 --&gt; 00:00:40,660
First the move to the west.

16
00:00:40,660 --&gt; 00:00:43,950
The center is, from 1917, is no longer
Russia.

17
00:00:43,950 --&gt; 00:00:46,030
because it goes underground in Russia.

18
00:00:46,030 --&gt; 00:00:48,150
It's no longer eastern Europe.

19
00:00:48,150 --&gt; 00:00:52,410
Afterwards the entire eastern Europe falls
under Soviet

20
00:00:52,410 --&gt; 00:00:56,410
domin, domination and all these mystical
movements go underground.

21
00:00:56,410 --&gt; 00:00:56,910
So.

22
00:00:58,000 --&gt; 00:01:03,630
During the 20th was a shift to the west.
To the Anglo-Saxon world for instance.

23
00:01:03,630 --&gt; 00:01:04,530
And this is part of a much

24
00:01:04,530 --&gt; 00:01:08,130
wider development of a globalization of
spirituality.

25
00:01:08,130 --&gt; 00:01:12,400
Which, in, throughout the 20th century,
because of these relocations, just

26
00:01:12,400 --&gt; 00:01:16,640
like the move of Eastern mysticism from
places like Japan and China.

27
00:01:16,640 --&gt; 00:01:17,810
After the communist revolution

28
00:01:17,810 --&gt; 00:01:21,070
in China, it moves away from China,
eventually it gets to the west.

29
00:01:21,070 --&gt; 00:01:25,500
Japan, after the American occupation,
after the Second World War,

30
00:01:25,500 --&gt; 00:01:28,910
we have this influx of Japanese teachers
coming to America.

31
00:01:28,910 --&gt; 00:01:31,930
So, all this is part of a big transition
of

32
00:01:31,930 --&gt; 00:01:34,890
globalization of spirituality through
translations,

33
00:01:34,890 --&gt; 00:01:36,650
later on through the internet.

34
00:01:36,650 --&gt; 00:01:38,780
Which means that really we've got a really
a cool

35
00:01:38,780 --&gt; 00:01:43,090
situation today is that we, the mystical
libraries really are becoming

36
00:01:43,090 --&gt; 00:01:44,968
more and more available to us.

37
00:01:44,968 --&gt; 00:01:47,350
That these texts translated to English,
written

38
00:01:47,350 --&gt; 00:01:52,510
in English maybe em, available to us.

39
00:01:52,510 --&gt; 00:01:55,860
Over different mystical traditions, it
makes comparison easier.

40
00:01:55,860 --&gt; 00:01:57,570
We have to remember to control the
comparison,

41
00:01:57,570 --&gt; 00:01:59,150
not to get, let it get out of hand.

42
00:02:00,150 --&gt; 00:02:02,710
Now I want to speak of the movement to
England.

43
00:02:02,710 --&gt; 00:02:08,820
So a tradition which comes from 19th
Century, 20th Century figures St. Silouan

44
00:02:08,820 --&gt; 00:02:12,598
the Athonite and then it's developed by a

45
00:02:12,598 --&gt; 00:02:15,650
very interesting figure who moved to
England, Sophrony

46
00:02:15,650 --&gt; 00:02:21,100
of x, Essex, Essex in England, who had a
interest in yoga and in Indian philosophy.

47
00:02:21,100 --&gt; 00:02:22,890
So this meeting of east and west that I

48
00:02:22,890 --&gt; 00:02:25,670
spoke about, we can see it here in this
lineage.

49
00:02:25,670 --&gt; 00:02:26,480
In this tradition.

50
00:02:27,550 --&gt; 00:02:29,600
And here we have his student,

51
00:02:30,820 --&gt; 00:02:34,420
Archimandrite Zacharias, also working near
Essex,

52
00:02:34,420 --&gt; 00:02:35,480
in England.

53
00:02:36,560 --&gt; 00:02:40,460
And he has a book which, again, is quite
easily available,

54
00:02:40,460 --&gt; 00:02:45,140
The Hidden Man of the Heart, published by
Mount Thabor Publishing.

55
00:02:45,140 --&gt; 00:02:49,090
Again Mount Thabor in Israel, not the
press, but the place.

56
00:02:50,140 --&gt; 00:02:53,330
Now the themes are similar to what we saw
now in

57
00:02:53,330 --&gt; 00:02:57,630
the, the book by Theophan, The Turning of
the Heart to God.

58
00:02:57,630 --&gt; 00:02:59,720
But the analysis is more modern.

59
00:02:59,720 --&gt; 00:03:03,040
And here I think the connection to
psychology becomes much

60
00:03:03,040 --&gt; 00:03:06,370
stronger because this is what happens in
the 20th Century.

61
00:03:06,370 --&gt; 00:03:09,950
Also in Kabbalah, is that 20th Century

62
00:03:09,950 --&gt; 00:03:12,820
mystical writers are really writing after
Freud.

63
00:03:12,820 --&gt; 00:03:14,080
And they're writing after Jung.

64
00:03:14,080 --&gt; 00:03:16,840
And they, they're aware of these
psychological developments,

65
00:03:16,840 --&gt; 00:03:18,820
and they're responding to them in some
way.

66
00:03:18,820 --&gt; 00:03:22,410
They usually don't respond explicitly.
They speak in the language of tradition.

67
00:03:22,410 --&gt; 00:03:25,200
No, we're just speaking about what

68
00:03:25,200 --&gt; 00:03:30,640
St Silouan Zaphanite spoke about, or what
St Theophan spoke about, but

69
00:03:30,640 --&gt; 00:03:35,886
the, the language, we'll see, becomes more
obviously contemporary

70
00:03:35,886 --&gt; 00:03:40,930
in its psychological discourse.
So I want to speak a bit about this book.

71
00:03:40,930 --&gt; 00:03:44,910
He has the similar themes, the idea of
the, the heart is the battlefield.

72
00:03:47,240 --&gt; 00:03:51,980
Now, here he speaks a bit more about
alienation, that we become

73
00:03:51,980 --&gt; 00:03:56,530
subjected to these demonic forces that we
saw already, that we become alienated.

74
00:03:56,530 --&gt; 00:03:59,160
He speaks more explicitly about this theme
of becoming

75
00:03:59,160 --&gt; 00:04:02,570
outside ourselves, or being cut off from
our own hearts,

76
00:04:02,570 --&gt; 00:04:07,580
that paradoxically this very egotistical
focus takes us outside ourselves,

77
00:04:07,580 --&gt; 00:04:09,300
cuts us off from the reaches of the inner
world.

78
00:04:09,300 --&gt; 00:04:12,580
And then he says,

79
00:04:12,580 --&gt; 00:04:14,570
for instance, we even pray outside the
heart, which

80
00:04:14,570 --&gt; 00:04:16,990
is a very, very common problem for
religious people

81
00:04:18,470 --&gt; 00:04:22,630
And the idea that prayer becomes almost a
routine,

82
00:04:22,630 --&gt; 00:04:26,040
it becomes something external, we become
alienated from it.

83
00:04:26,040 --&gt; 00:04:27,410
It's not an expression of a heart.

84
00:04:27,410 --&gt; 00:04:29,330
It's not an outpouring of a heart.

85
00:04:29,330 --&gt; 00:04:31,560
It's really one of those things that we
become attached to.

86
00:04:31,560 --&gt; 00:04:33,100
One of these habits.

87
00:04:33,100 --&gt; 00:04:35,660
And therefore the demonic can even
infiltrate

88
00:04:35,660 --&gt; 00:04:38,240
prayer in a way because it's alienated
prayer.

89
00:04:38,240 --&gt; 00:04:41,450
It's not a prayer which connects to the
heart but it's prayer which

90
00:04:41,450 --&gt; 00:04:45,180
really can become social, it can become
habitual and so on and so forth.

91
00:04:45,180 --&gt; 00:04:49,770
So, again, this is a problem that
Hasidism, Hasidism speaks about a lot

92
00:04:49,770 --&gt; 00:04:52,540
or whereby Cook in [UNKNOWN] Hasidism

93
00:04:52,540 --&gt; 00:04:55,110
especially, this idea of alienation in
prayer.

94
00:04:56,360 --&gt; 00:05:04,110
Now, and one has to remember that mystics
actually are mostly also religious people.

95
00:05:04,110 --&gt; 00:05:06,820
It's true that in the 20th century, it's
more common to have

96
00:05:06,820 --&gt; 00:05:10,410
what's called unchurched mysticism,
spiritual but

97
00:05:10,410 --&gt; 00:05:12,280
not religious, as they say today.

98
00:05:12,280 --&gt; 00:05:14,600
It's more common in the new age movement
for people

99
00:05:14,600 --&gt; 00:05:18,960
don't belong to religious tradition and
still have mystical experiences.

100
00:05:18,960 --&gt; 00:05:21,750
And really, at the turn of the century,

101
00:05:21,750 --&gt; 00:05:24,190
William James begins to speak about things
like this.

102
00:05:24,190 --&gt; 00:05:27,350
And there's this book, Cosmic
Consciousness, which, writings

103
00:05:27,350 --&gt; 00:05:29,940
which are not exactly on the side of
tradition.

104
00:05:29,940 --&gt; 00:05:35,010
However, historically speaking, mysticism
takes place inside traditions.

105
00:05:35,010 --&gt; 00:05:37,850
And in the 20th century, continuously,

106
00:05:37,850 --&gt; 00:05:40,570
these traditions continue to develop, to
grow.

107
00:05:40,570 --&gt; 00:05:43,710
And most of the mystics still are working
inside traditions.

108
00:05:43,710 --&gt; 00:05:48,230
So we have to contend with, how does one
win this question, how does

109
00:05:48,230 --&gt; 00:05:51,630
one win mystical awareness, mystical
awakening, mystical

110
00:05:51,630 --&gt; 00:05:54,960
enthusiasm, this fire, over heart, into
the

111
00:05:54,960 --&gt; 00:05:58,520
routine religious life which people who
follow religious tradition are part of?

112
00:06:00,040 --&gt; 00:06:06,080
So, he says again, only through grace can
one reconnect to oneself.

113
00:06:06,080 --&gt; 00:06:08,250
In a way, one can only pray for grace.

114
00:06:08,250 --&gt; 00:06:11,604
It's a paradox that one can only pray to
God through the grace of God.

115
00:06:11,604 --&gt; 00:06:16,120
And that's why the Jesus prayer's about
asking Christ to have mercy

116
00:06:16,120 --&gt; 00:06:19,060
on us because without that, we can't
really pray in the first place.

117
00:06:19,060 --&gt; 00:06:19,810
So we pray to,

118
00:06:19,810 --&gt; 00:06:23,380
in order to be able to pray, in a way,
through this mercy.

119
00:06:23,380 --&gt; 00:06:26,450
And that is, he speaks about crying out to
God.

120
00:06:26,450 --&gt; 00:06:30,100
Again, very similar to [UNKNOWN] idea that
you have actually go into seclusion.

121
00:06:30,100 --&gt; 00:06:31,590
Go into the forest and scream to God.

122
00:06:31,590 --&gt; 00:06:33,460
Here in Jerusalem you can hear that.

123
00:06:33,460 --&gt; 00:06:36,030
Not far from campus here, there's a sort
of

124
00:06:36,030 --&gt; 00:06:40,740
small forest where [UNKNOWN] come to, to
scream to God.

125
00:06:40,740 --&gt; 00:06:44,840
And this idea of crying out to God is a
very strong theme because that's how

126
00:06:44,840 --&gt; 00:06:46,750
the heart awakens God's grace really.

127
00:06:47,860 --&gt; 00:06:51,380
Now, he speaks in very contemporary
language.

128
00:06:51,380 --&gt; 00:06:54,670
He says repentance is not just a
psychological process.

129
00:06:54,670 --&gt; 00:06:56,080
It's an ontological process.

130
00:06:56,080 --&gt; 00:06:57,710
It's a change of being.

131
00:06:57,710 --&gt; 00:07:00,820
And this is like existentialist
psychology, is that one isn't only

132
00:07:00,820 --&gt; 00:07:03,210
changing one's psychology, in the
emotional

133
00:07:03,210 --&gt; 00:07:05,200
sense, one's changing one's very being.

134
00:07:05,200 --&gt; 00:07:08,660
How one's, one's being in the world, as
the existentialists have it.

135
00:07:08,660 --&gt; 00:07:10,040
How one experiences our self,

136
00:07:10,040 --&gt; 00:07:12,090
how one experiences the roots of our
existence.

137
00:07:13,270 --&gt; 00:07:18,180
Now, then he moves into a slightly New Age
kind of theme.

138
00:07:18,180 --&gt; 00:07:20,720
He says this is a psychic pain that we
experience.

139
00:07:20,720 --&gt; 00:07:25,290
This is again a psychoanalytic term from a
analyst who just passed away, actually.

140
00:07:25,290 --&gt; 00:07:28,600
A very wise analyst called Betty Joseph in
London.

141
00:07:28,600 --&gt; 00:07:29,950
Also in England.

142
00:07:29,950 --&gt; 00:07:34,670
And so, he says we have this, this pain,
which he describes as,

143
00:07:34,670 --&gt; 00:07:37,890
almost as a psychic pain.
That one feels pain in the psyche.

144
00:07:37,890 --&gt; 00:07:40,450
It's, it's, come to, as Betty Joseph
shows, you can

145
00:07:40,450 --&gt; 00:07:43,120
feel pain, not just in the body, but in
the psyche.

146
00:07:43,120 --&gt; 00:07:45,970
And he says this pain comes from negative
energies.

147
00:07:45,970 --&gt; 00:07:48,237
This is a kind of very new-age term.

148
00:07:48,237 --&gt; 00:07:51,310
However, one must remember that this
whole, this force

149
00:07:51,310 --&gt; 00:07:54,080
about life, the experience of life is
about energy really.

150
00:07:55,100 --&gt; 00:07:59,550
And the term energia, which is again
energy,

151
00:07:59,550 --&gt; 00:08:02,900
Greek, is is really a Hesychast term.

152
00:08:02,900 --&gt; 00:08:05,170
This is a term which is used a lot in the
Eastern church.

153
00:08:05,170 --&gt; 00:08:07,910
So it's not just an invention of the new
age.

154
00:08:07,910 --&gt; 00:08:10,450
Now, he says, one has to

155
00:08:10,450 --&gt; 00:08:14,350
transfer psychological states into
spiritual states.

156
00:08:14,350 --&gt; 00:08:17,710
See, here's a writer who's contended of
psychology.

157
00:08:17,710 --&gt; 00:08:20,090
He knows that there's a whole tendency
today

158
00:08:20,090 --&gt; 00:08:22,305
to psychologize everything, the

159
00:08:22,305 --&gt; 00:08:25,920
post-Freudian tendency, including
psychologizing religion.

160
00:08:25,920 --&gt; 00:08:29,040
And he says, the, the, the challenge
really

161
00:08:29,040 --&gt; 00:08:31,510
is not to remain in the psychological
realm.

162
00:08:31,510 --&gt; 00:08:33,190
That a lot of religious writing almost

163
00:08:33,190 --&gt; 00:08:35,650
tends to be reduced to psychological
discourse.

164
00:08:35,650 --&gt; 00:08:38,510
That it really becomes a kind of self-help
movement.

165
00:08:38,510 --&gt; 00:08:40,590
But how to move to this ontological level.

166
00:08:40,590 --&gt; 00:08:44,260
This level of how to be with God.
To the spiritual level.

167
00:08:44,260 --&gt; 00:08:46,920
This is the transformation that he's
speaking about.

168
00:08:46,920 --&gt; 00:08:50,990
So again, the same idea of transformation
that we saw in the 19th century

169
00:08:50,990 --&gt; 00:08:54,230
text, but it's a different kind of
transformation, because here he's speaking

170
00:08:54,230 --&gt; 00:08:58,870
about how to shift from the psychological,
but we're already in the psychological.

171
00:08:58,870 --&gt; 00:09:00,540
We don't need a book to tell us about how

172
00:09:00,540 --&gt; 00:09:03,160
to be psychological, how to be in touch
with ourselves.

173
00:09:03,160 --&gt; 00:09:05,290
That's what the world is about today.

174
00:09:05,290 --&gt; 00:09:09,620
It's more about the shift from the
psychological to

175
00:09:09,620 --&gt; 00:09:11,960
a deeper level of being, to a more
spiritual plane.

176
00:09:13,140 --&gt; 00:09:13,640
Now,

177
00:09:16,440 --&gt; 00:09:21,060
he speaks here about how to change one's
thought.

178
00:09:21,060 --&gt; 00:09:22,990
And this is very interesting because
there's,

179
00:09:22,990 --&gt; 00:09:24,700
there's an old idea, which we find in

180
00:09:24,700 --&gt; 00:09:27,410
the Desert Fathers, of capturing thoughts
for Christ,

181
00:09:28,410 --&gt; 00:09:31,330
that one has to look at one's thoughts.

182
00:09:31,330 --&gt; 00:09:32,880
And one starts thinking about all kinds

183
00:09:32,880 --&gt; 00:09:35,940
of things vis-a-vis attachments, Logismoi,
there's all

184
00:09:35,940 --&gt; 00:09:42,230
the, the, the, this sort of I would say
cluster of thoughts would come up.

185
00:09:42,230 --&gt; 00:09:44,390
If one observes oneself day to day.

186
00:09:44,390 --&gt; 00:09:46,370
And the idea is not to push them away in
so much.

187
00:09:46,370 --&gt; 00:09:49,250
But to take these thoughts, transform
them,

188
00:09:49,250 --&gt; 00:09:51,270
and move them to a spiritual direction.

189
00:09:51,270 --&gt; 00:09:55,140
To take again, one's psychology and
transform it in a spiritual direction.

190
00:09:55,140 --&gt; 00:10:00,130
Move it to the spiritual realm.
And by

191
00:10:00,130 --&gt; 00:10:05,710
this capturing of thoughts, eventually our
thought itself becomes more spiritual.

192
00:10:05,710 --&gt; 00:10:07,340
That is, we live inside our thoughts.
We live

193
00:10:07,340 --&gt; 00:10:10,270
in our head in a way and the idea is,
again, to

194
00:10:10,270 --&gt; 00:10:14,600
take these thoughts, to transform them, to
bring them to a spiritual place.

195
00:10:14,600 --&gt; 00:10:17,912
Now a very interesting parallel here to
Hasidism because

196
00:10:17,912 --&gt; 00:10:20,534
one of the great innovations of the
founder of

197
00:10:20,534 --&gt; 00:10:23,915
Hasidism, the Baal Shem, that I mentioned,
the Besht,

198
00:10:23,915 --&gt; 00:10:27,330
is that where one's thought is, that's
where one is.

199
00:10:28,360 --&gt; 00:10:31,820
And he, that's why he said, think good and
it will be good.

200
00:10:31,820 --&gt; 00:10:32,490
The,

201
00:10:32,490 --&gt; 00:10:34,430
one can transform oneself through
thinking.

202
00:10:34,430 --&gt; 00:10:35,090
Through taking thought.

203
00:10:35,090 --&gt; 00:10:37,190
Which is very much like positive

204
00:10:37,190 --&gt; 00:10:41,276
psychology, cognitive psychology or
cognitive positive psychology.

205
00:10:41,276 --&gt; 00:10:44,310
The idea that if we change our thoughts
and this will change our being in a way.

206
00:10:45,350 --&gt; 00:10:50,630
And also very similar to Hasidism, the
idea of uplifting thoughts.

207
00:10:50,630 --&gt; 00:10:55,180
That, there was a big debate about this in
the Hasidic movement.

208
00:10:55,180 --&gt; 00:10:57,919
But many 19th and also 20th century

209
00:10:57,919 --&gt; 00:11:01,073
Hasidic texts say that at least Hasidic,
for

210
00:11:01,073 --&gt; 00:11:05,630
righteous person but maybe also for, for
other people.

211
00:11:05,630 --&gt; 00:11:10,100
The idea is that one doesn't push away the
thoughts but one looks

212
00:11:10,100 --&gt; 00:11:14,320
at the thoughts and tries to see how one
can relate them to spirituality.

213
00:11:14,320 --&gt; 00:11:17,610
So, sometimes it's very radical statements
that ideologue has written about this.

214
00:11:17,610 --&gt; 00:11:20,524
That we when look, look at a beautiful
woman and one

215
00:11:20,524 --&gt; 00:11:24,010
has to uplift the idea of beauty to the
divine beauty.

216
00:11:24,010 --&gt; 00:11:29,680
Or, the idea that one has desires, or one
has impulses, and to

217
00:11:29,680 --&gt; 00:11:34,420
see how one can relate these impulses,
these desires, to the divine realm.

218
00:11:34,420 --&gt; 00:11:36,480
So this is the same idea also here in the

219
00:11:36,480 --&gt; 00:11:39,160
Eastern context, and I think this is one
of the parallels.

220
00:11:39,160 --&gt; 00:11:41,420
The idea of, of taking these thoughts and

221
00:11:41,420 --&gt; 00:11:45,820
transmuting them, transforming them,
rather than rejecting them.

222
00:11:45,820 --&gt; 00:11:48,780
Again, this is a very strong issue today
in Buddhist psychology.

223
00:11:48,780 --&gt; 00:11:51,890
People like Jason Siff in the Buddhist
world, that's Siff,

224
00:11:51,890 --&gt; 00:11:56,530
are working on this idea that thoughts are
not the enemy.

225
00:11:56,530 --&gt; 00:11:58,010
You can find that on the web.

226
00:11:58,010 --&gt; 00:12:02,820
It's a, a lecture by his, of his, that
thoughts are not the enemy.

227
00:12:02,820 --&gt; 00:12:06,090
That one doesn't have to push away the
thoughts, one can do something with them.

228
00:12:06,090 --&gt; 00:12:08,020
And again, this is a very old tradition of
the desert

229
00:12:08,020 --&gt; 00:12:12,130
fathers, for the whole Hesychast movement,
with this possible influence on Hasidism.

230
00:12:13,300 --&gt; 00:12:15,510
Now I'll

231
00:12:15,510 --&gt; 00:12:18,570
use one more psychological term here
that's very much, I mentioned it a few

232
00:12:18,570 --&gt; 00:12:21,300
times today NLP, so maybe it's worth

233
00:12:21,300 --&gt; 00:12:23,100
getting into this a bit towards the
conclusion.

234
00:12:24,180 --&gt; 00:12:27,330
That in the 20th Century, we had very
interesting

235
00:12:27,330 --&gt; 00:12:31,650
developments in psychology, in cognitive
psychology, related to hypnosis.

236
00:12:31,650 --&gt; 00:12:35,210
A kind of meeting of cognitive psychology
and hypnosis.

237
00:12:35,210 --&gt; 00:12:37,950
When people went and they studied the
hypnotic techniques of

238
00:12:37,950 --&gt; 00:12:40,570
Milton Erikson the great, one of the great
hypnotists of the

239
00:12:40,570 --&gt; 00:12:42,280
20th century in America.

240
00:12:42,280 --&gt; 00:12:46,775
And it blended out of cognitive psychology
to develop a system of change in

241
00:12:46,775 --&gt; 00:12:51,430
one's thoughts, often through trance but
not only in order to change one's life.

242
00:12:51,430 --&gt; 00:12:57,262
So it's a sort of blends in with positive
psychology, human potential movement etc.,

243
00:12:57,262 --&gt; 00:13:02,290
and this is the Neuro-Linguistic
Programming NLP, it

244
00:13:02,290 --&gt; 00:13:05,540
still the name but it is an interesting
movement.

245
00:13:05,540 --&gt; 00:13:09,920
And, this, one of the key ideas in NLP is
reframing.

246
00:13:09,920 --&gt; 00:13:13,450
That one takes the same materials of our
psychological life.

247
00:13:13,450 --&gt; 00:13:16,612
One isn't doing, sort of a heart
transplant of a psyche, by

248
00:13:16,612 --&gt; 00:13:20,630
putting in a new self different from what
we've been seeing here.

249
00:13:20,630 --&gt; 00:13:26,050
But one takes the same old self and just
thinks about it differently.

250
00:13:26,050 --&gt; 00:13:29,700
Transforms these thoughts, reframes these
thoughts.

251
00:13:29,700 --&gt; 00:13:30,600
Now, I think this is

252
00:13:30,600 --&gt; 00:13:34,770
a big difference between the two texts
we're speaking about, we've been seeing.

253
00:13:34,770 --&gt; 00:13:36,170
There are common themes.

254
00:13:36,170 --&gt; 00:13:39,390
But in the 19th Century, it was more about
seeing the old self

255
00:13:39,390 --&gt; 00:13:43,630
as a kind of enemy that one has to, become
a corpse and die.

256
00:13:43,630 --&gt; 00:13:48,530
And it's demonic.
And only the grace of God, et cetera.

257
00:13:48,530 --&gt; 00:13:50,840
Here we still have a demonic.
We still have a grace of God.

258
00:13:50,840 --&gt; 00:13:51,530
It's all true.

259
00:13:52,608 --&gt; 00:13:55,900
It's, when I say it's more psychological
because it's vision in a culture,

260
00:13:55,900 --&gt; 00:13:59,690
which is already more psychological.
But it's more positive.

261
00:13:59,690 --&gt; 00:14:01,960
And I think the element of positive
psychology, and we see

262
00:14:01,960 --&gt; 00:14:05,320
the same thing offered by Cooke, offered
by Aslam, with other figures.

263
00:14:05,320 --&gt; 00:14:09,030
There's much less talk about the demonic
forces.

264
00:14:09,030 --&gt; 00:14:11,490
The demonic forces, very few Kabbalahists
talk about them today.

265
00:14:11,490 --&gt; 00:14:12,810
It's not so popular.

266
00:14:12,810 --&gt; 00:14:19,580
There's less talk about how one has to
mortify oneself and do many fasts, etc.,

267
00:14:19,580 --&gt; 00:14:20,860
etc.

268
00:14:20,860 --&gt; 00:14:23,870
There's far more of a positive emphasis
and I think this is

269
00:14:23,870 --&gt; 00:14:27,830
a big shift which happened in the 20th
century towards positive psychology.

270
00:14:27,830 --&gt; 00:14:29,690
Which is why it's so popular today.

271
00:14:29,690 --&gt; 00:14:32,060
But again, it's positive spiritual
psychology.

272
00:14:32,060 --&gt; 00:14:35,180
One has to remember all the time that the
focus, also in

273
00:14:35,180 --&gt; 00:14:38,550
the Hasidic movement, is that one has to
be passive in some way.

274
00:14:38,550 --&gt; 00:14:41,590
It's not all self made.
There's also God's grace in the picture.

275
00:14:41,590 --&gt; 00:14:45,940
So, I think this is a good way to wrap up
our historical narrative

276
00:14:45,940 --&gt; 00:14:48,380
of 19th, 20th century.

277
00:14:48,380 --&gt; 00:14:50,750
Now we're going to move from Eastern
Europe, that Hasidism

278
00:14:50,750 --&gt; 00:14:53,380
is Eastern European, Rabbi Cook came from
Eastern Europe, Rabbi

279
00:14:53,380 --&gt; 00:14:56,340
Ashtera come from Eastern Europe, we're
going to move westwards

280
00:14:56,340 --&gt; 00:14:59,120
and speak about the Protestant worlds and
about the Catholic world.
