1
00:00:00,500 --&gt; 00:00:04,070
Now, I want to get to the text, I will
read it first.

2
00:00:04,070 --&gt; 00:00:08,900
I hope I can convey some of the pathos
that comes within the text for my voice.

3
00:00:10,350 --&gt; 00:00:13,020
Rabbi Kook write as follows.
Now, this is a letter from 1911.

4
00:00:13,020 --&gt; 00:00:18,470
In, there is three volume, four volumes
actually one recently published of

5
00:00:18,470 --&gt; 00:00:22,310
letters of Rabbi Kook, there's a English
translation of some of these.

6
00:00:22,310 --&gt; 00:00:24,840
I usually prefer to use my own
translations.

7
00:00:24,840 --&gt; 00:00:26,440
This is my own translation because

8
00:00:28,990 --&gt; 00:00:31,190
it is well known translation is
interpretation.

9
00:00:31,190 --&gt; 00:00:34,460
Especially for Latin to Latin in such a
poetic vein like by Rabbi Kook.

10
00:00:35,970 --&gt; 00:00:36,720
And he writes as follows.

11
00:00:38,760 --&gt; 00:00:43,310
The justice that appears to us.
In relation to good and evil

12
00:00:44,420 --&gt; 00:00:49,560
that extends to free choice, is nothing
but the superficial aspect.

13
00:00:49,560 --&gt; 00:00:50,520
And he has a bit of a skip.

14
00:00:52,090 --&gt; 00:00:54,230
And now the text continues.

15
00:00:54,230 --&gt; 00:01:00,570
However, the internal aspect of it, of its
justice I say, is more exalted.

16
00:01:00,570 --&gt; 00:01:04,320
Again, skipping a bit, so that no moral
question can apply

17
00:01:04,320 --&gt; 00:01:09,540
to it, for it is higher than morality and
all of its values.

18
00:01:09,540 --&gt; 00:01:10,200
Again skipping.

19
00:01:11,250 --&gt; 00:01:15,320
This is the wealth of a divine science,
whose flag is born

20
00:01:15,320 --&gt; 00:01:20,970
by our nation, to announce the absolute
freedom of a higher absolute reality.

21
00:01:23,190 --&gt; 00:01:24,040
Again skipping.

22
00:01:24,040 --&gt; 00:01:27,920
And I'm not dealing now with the
psychological questions, to clarify

23
00:01:27,920 --&gt; 00:01:32,010
what is this essence of life that is
revealed by free will.

24
00:01:32,010 --&gt; 00:01:34,810
We say then that our very essence is free
choice.

25
00:01:36,100 --&gt; 00:01:36,700
Again skipping.

26
00:01:36,700 --&gt; 00:01:41,010
So that the reality of the will that is
manifested in practical choices.

27
00:01:41,010 --&gt; 00:01:45,870
Is only a shadow, an infant over hidden
depth of free will.

28
00:01:45,870 --&gt; 00:01:48,300
And time and space themselves,

29
00:01:48,300 --&gt; 00:01:51,450
short skipping, are also a limited shadow

30
00:01:51,450 --&gt; 00:01:54,200
of our attainment of a higher free
reality.

31
00:01:55,360 --&gt; 00:01:59,620
It is east to understand that drawing
closer to the absolute good.

32
00:01:59,620 --&gt; 00:02:03,450
And free will of divinity develops all of
existence.

33
00:02:03,450 --&gt; 00:02:06,600
It reveals the light of individual souls
and it continues

34
00:02:06,600 --&gt; 00:02:10,320
with texts Volume two of Letters in
Hebrew, letters 379.

35
00:02:10,320 --&gt; 00:02:13,730
So, what I want you to do now, is really
to

36
00:02:15,320 --&gt; 00:02:19,110
to look at this text sentence by sentence,
what we call a close reading,

37
00:02:19,110 --&gt; 00:02:22,670
of the level of a sentence, this kind of
resolution, close resolution, zoom in.

38
00:02:24,380 --&gt; 00:02:26,740
And to see what are the key words, that's
usually my method.

39
00:02:26,740 --&gt; 00:02:28,900
First of all, to see what are the key
words in

40
00:02:28,900 --&gt; 00:02:32,140
the text, and then to give them some kind
of historical context.

41
00:02:32,140 --&gt; 00:02:36,040
So that's usually how I work, from the
keywords of a text to the context.

42
00:02:36,040 --&gt; 00:02:37,650
So it begins like this.

43
00:02:38,720 --&gt; 00:02:40,500
The justice that appears to us

44
00:02:40,500 --&gt; 00:02:43,160
in relation to good and evil that extends

45
00:02:43,160 --&gt; 00:02:46,140
to free choice, is nothing but the
superficial aspect.

46
00:02:47,200 --&gt; 00:02:50,150
So, the key word here I think is, first of
all, justice.

47
00:02:50,150 --&gt; 00:02:51,358
There's a concern with justice.

48
00:02:51,358 --&gt; 00:02:55,670
Just like [UNKNOWN] may be social justice
as well.

49
00:02:55,670 --&gt; 00:02:58,350
However, more of a concern with freedom.

50
00:02:58,350 --&gt; 00:03:01,470
Rabbi Cook was very much interested in
freedom.

51
00:03:01,470 --&gt; 00:03:06,110
Just like Freud was interested in freedom.
The whole idea of being emancipated from

52
00:03:06,110 --&gt; 00:03:09,530
the shackles of the unconscious forces
driving

53
00:03:09,530 --&gt; 00:03:11,090
us and getting to more self control.

54
00:03:11,090 --&gt; 00:03:14,640
And just like Marx is interested in
freedom on a social level.

55
00:03:14,640 --&gt; 00:03:16,170
And Nietzsche was interested in freedom.

56
00:03:16,170 --&gt; 00:03:18,210
Of breaking free from the constraints of

57
00:03:18,210 --&gt; 00:03:21,420
religion or philosophy, of morality in a
way.

58
00:03:21,420 --&gt; 00:03:24,030
Go beyond good and evil, we'll get to this
soon.

59
00:03:24,030 --&gt; 00:03:26,040
Nietzsche's very present in this text.

60
00:03:26,040 --&gt; 00:03:29,090
Now, the issue here is freedom.

61
00:03:29,090 --&gt; 00:03:31,720
And here Rabbi Kook has a radical
innovation

62
00:03:31,720 --&gt; 00:03:33,660
relative to the Jewish tradition.

63
00:03:33,660 --&gt; 00:03:37,000
The freedom, the choice between good and
evil.

64
00:03:37,000 --&gt; 00:03:38,960
In relation to good and evil, that extends

65
00:03:38,960 --&gt; 00:03:42,670
to free choice, is nothing but the
superficial aspect.

66
00:03:42,670 --&gt; 00:03:46,570
So what he's saying is, that's free
choice, which is such a

67
00:03:46,570 --&gt; 00:03:51,030
central principal in the Jewish world, is
actually only the superficial aspect.

68
00:03:51,030 --&gt; 00:03:52,730
Which would be heresy for somebody

69
00:03:52,730 --&gt; 00:03:55,440
like the great, free, modern thinker
Maimonides.

70
00:03:55,440 --&gt; 00:03:57,150
Who writes that

71
00:03:57,150 --&gt; 00:04:00,830
basically the basis of the entire Torah
the entire religion is free choice.

72
00:04:01,960 --&gt; 00:04:05,430
He says no, free choice is a superficial
aspect.

73
00:04:05,430 --&gt; 00:04:07,860
Now there are connections here to Hasidic
thought that I

74
00:04:07,860 --&gt; 00:04:11,740
won't play into, to the Izhbitzer that I
mentioned before.

75
00:04:11,740 --&gt; 00:04:15,470
I don't want to go into this because I
want to focus on the broader context.

76
00:04:15,470 --&gt; 00:04:20,070
Of what is happening in European culture.
So Rabbi Kook goes on.

77
00:04:20,070 --&gt; 00:04:22,470
And this is a natural continuation of
this,

78
00:04:22,470 --&gt; 00:04:26,320
a logical continuation.
The internal aspect of it is more exalted.

79
00:04:26,320 --&gt; 00:04:27,990
Choice has an internal aspect.

80
00:04:27,990 --&gt; 00:04:31,230
There's a hidden internal level behind our
choices.

81
00:04:31,230 --&gt; 00:04:34,445
So here, Rabbi Kook is very much in the
language of.

82
00:04:34,445 --&gt; 00:04:37,330
External-internal.

83
00:04:37,330 --&gt; 00:04:42,840
Now's there's a whole book about this, an
important book by Maroglin of Tel Aviv

84
00:04:42,840 --&gt; 00:04:47,950
university, on this topic.
But again as a modernist

85
00:04:47,950 --&gt; 00:04:53,190
I want to focus on how this theme of
internal intensifies in the modern period.

86
00:04:53,190 --&gt; 00:04:55,340
Intensifies in a romantic movement.

87
00:04:55,340 --&gt; 00:04:58,420
Intensifies in psychoanalysis, and
intensifies in modern Kabbalah.

88
00:04:58,420 --&gt; 00:05:01,180
The whole focus on the inner world.

89
00:05:01,180 --&gt; 00:05:03,960
That behind our outer choices, our outer
deeds,

90
00:05:03,960 --&gt; 00:05:07,230
there are entire subtle, hin, hidden,
internal levels

91
00:05:07,230 --&gt; 00:05:09,220
driving us that for Rabbi Kook are far

92
00:05:09,220 --&gt; 00:05:11,690
more important than what he calls the
superficial aspect.

93
00:05:11,690 --&gt; 00:05:13,070
Of what some call

94
00:05:13,070 --&gt; 00:05:14,970
today the surface mind.

95
00:05:14,970 --&gt; 00:05:18,300
So that no moral question can apply to it,
he continues,

96
00:05:18,300 --&gt; 00:05:21,150
for it is higher than morality and all of
its values.

97
00:05:21,150 --&gt; 00:05:22,320
This is a very strong sentence.

98
00:05:22,320 --&gt; 00:05:25,450
The internal level is higher than
morality.

99
00:05:25,450 --&gt; 00:05:27,600
Morality belongs to the surface mind.

100
00:05:27,600 --&gt; 00:05:30,930
The deeper parts of the psyche are beyond
good and evil, as Nietzsche put it.

101
00:05:30,930 --&gt; 00:05:32,370
We're beyond morality.

102
00:05:32,370 --&gt; 00:05:34,410
Rabbi Kook has a poem, he says.

103
00:05:34,410 --&gt; 00:05:38,100
My soul desires expanses, free me from the
limitations

104
00:05:38,100 --&gt; 00:05:39,580
of logic of morality.

105
00:05:39,580 --&gt; 00:05:43,130
This is very radical thought,
anti-Normian, against the norms,

106
00:05:43,130 --&gt; 00:05:46,470
against the law, against codes of
morality, the constrains

107
00:05:46,470 --&gt; 00:05:48,620
of morality, very much in the spirit of
his

108
00:05:48,620 --&gt; 00:05:52,360
times of Nietzsche and other writers of
his kind, Dostoevsky.

109
00:05:52,360 --&gt; 00:05:57,020
The, whole idea here is that the inner
forces are trans moral.

110
00:05:57,020 --&gt; 00:05:59,920
The same forces that Freud thought that
the ego contained,

111
00:05:59,920 --&gt; 00:06:03,350
the civilized ego contained, Young was
more aware of a possibility

112
00:06:03,350 --&gt; 00:06:06,950
that maybe they transcend, even Young
spoke about conscience.

113
00:06:06,950 --&gt; 00:06:10,280
But he's, but that maybe he was more aware
of a possibility that they can.

114
00:06:10,280 --&gt; 00:06:12,420
Push beyond the borders of morality.

115
00:06:12,420 --&gt; 00:06:14,320
Of course, there's something dangerous
about this teaching.

116
00:06:14,320 --&gt; 00:06:17,360
I will speak about these dangers when I
speak about Rabbi Kook's circle.

117
00:06:19,400 --&gt; 00:06:21,220
So, Rabbi Kook goes on.

118
00:06:21,220 --&gt; 00:06:24,800
This is the wealth of the divine science,
whose flag is born

119
00:06:24,800 --&gt; 00:06:31,070
by our nation, to announce the absolute
freedom of the higher absolute reality.

120
00:06:31,070 --&gt; 00:06:34,010
So we are speaking about a divine science
which universally

121
00:06:34,010 --&gt; 00:06:38,260
it's a psychological science Rabbi Kook
fought that the external

122
00:06:38,260 --&gt; 00:06:41,060
science which he supported, he didn't
think for instance that

123
00:06:41,060 --&gt; 00:06:44,200
revolution is a challenge to religion on a
deeper level.

124
00:06:44,200 --&gt; 00:06:44,460
But this

125
00:06:44,460 --&gt; 00:06:49,030
also divine science and a few writers of
[UNKNOWN] also got it like this.

126
00:06:49,030 --&gt; 00:06:52,550
It is a divine psychological science, a
kabbalistic psychology early

127
00:06:52,550 --&gt; 00:06:55,480
as we put it And this is born by a nation.

128
00:06:55,480 --&gt; 00:06:56,230
It's national.

129
00:06:56,230 --&gt; 00:06:59,540
The Jewish people hails to the world.
This new divine science.

130
00:06:59,540 --&gt; 00:07:00,900
This new psychology.

131
00:07:00,900 --&gt; 00:07:02,150
Not just through the godless Jew

132
00:07:02,150 --&gt; 00:07:06,670
Freud, but through much more Kabbalistic
orientations.

133
00:07:06,670 --&gt; 00:07:07,920
And what is this divine science?

134
00:07:07,920 --&gt; 00:07:09,690
What does it do?
To announce

135
00:07:09,690 --&gt; 00:07:12,570
the absolute freedom of a higher absolute
reality.

136
00:07:12,570 --&gt; 00:07:15,630
Again, there's a deeper hidden reality,
cosmic reality.

137
00:07:15,630 --&gt; 00:07:17,190
Beneath the surface.

138
00:07:17,190 --&gt; 00:07:20,350
And this reality is free on a deeper
level.

139
00:07:20,350 --&gt; 00:07:23,330
What we think is free choice is just
superficial.

140
00:07:23,330 --&gt; 00:07:26,550
There's a much deeper freedom.
The freedom of the choices of the soul.

141
00:07:26,550 --&gt; 00:07:28,000
Not the choices of the ego.

142
00:07:28,000 --&gt; 00:07:32,120
Not the choices of what you may call the
persona, the external personality.

143
00:07:32,120 --&gt; 00:07:34,840
But the choices of the soul which is
deeply connected also

144
00:07:34,840 --&gt; 00:07:35,880
to the soul of the nation.

145
00:07:37,090 --&gt; 00:07:40,980
Now he says, I'm not dealing now with the
psychological questions to clarify

146
00:07:40,980 --&gt; 00:07:45,700
what is this essence of life that is
revealed, only revealed, by free will.

147
00:07:45,700 --&gt; 00:07:50,390
There's a deeper essence that the external
superficial freewill only reveals.

148
00:07:50,390 --&gt; 00:07:52,360
Now Rabbi Kook, now this could be
misleading,

149
00:07:52,360 --&gt; 00:07:54,419
he says we're not dealing with
psychological questions.

150
00:07:55,880 --&gt; 00:07:58,010
Of course he is dealing with psychological
questions, but

151
00:07:58,010 --&gt; 00:07:59,940
he wants to take it to a much deeper level

152
00:07:59,940 --&gt; 00:08:02,530
for him, the cosmic level.
Why?

153
00:08:02,530 --&gt; 00:08:05,280
We say that our very essence is free
choice.

154
00:08:05,280 --&gt; 00:08:07,070
So it's not that he's negating free
choice, he's

155
00:08:07,070 --&gt; 00:08:10,680
not really going against Maimonides, free
choice is very important.

156
00:08:10,680 --&gt; 00:08:15,070
But not the free choice of the external
personality, but of our absolute essence.

157
00:08:15,070 --&gt; 00:08:20,650
So the reality of the will that is
manifested in practical choices is

158
00:08:20,650 --&gt; 00:08:24,340
only a shadow and an imprint of the hidden
depth for free will.

159
00:08:24,340 --&gt; 00:08:25,030
There's a hidden

160
00:08:25,030 --&gt; 00:08:26,240
depth for free will.

161
00:08:26,240 --&gt; 00:08:29,890
This is depth psychology, as Freud, and
especially Jung, put it.

162
00:08:29,890 --&gt; 00:08:34,000
The psychology of depth.
That,Nietzsche also spoke about the abyss.

163
00:08:34,000 --&gt; 00:08:37,410
With deeper parts of the psyche of real
free will.

164
00:08:37,410 --&gt; 00:08:40,170
The practical choices are just a shadow of
us.

165
00:08:40,170 --&gt; 00:08:43,100
Our practical choices are just a pale
reflection

166
00:08:43,100 --&gt; 00:08:44,970
of the deeper choices of the soul, which
is

167
00:08:44,970 --&gt; 00:08:47,190
connected to the national soul, which is
connected to

168
00:08:47,190 --&gt; 00:08:49,380
the cosmic soul, which is connected to the
divine.

169
00:08:49,380 --&gt; 00:08:50,700
It's all

170
00:08:50,700 --&gt; 00:08:51,410
about connections.

171
00:08:52,530 --&gt; 00:08:55,340
And time and space themselves, this is
real cosmology.

172
00:08:55,340 --&gt; 00:08:58,800
And remember that this is a few years
after Einstein's theory of Relativity,

173
00:08:58,800 --&gt; 00:09:01,940
when he was speaking about for the, what
time and space are all about.

174
00:09:01,940 --&gt; 00:09:06,790
And it was actually somebody who worked in
close, Shem-Tov Gefen.

175
00:09:06,790 --&gt; 00:09:12,660
That's Shem and then Tov and then Gefen
Who was close

176
00:09:12,660 --&gt; 00:09:15,660
to Rabbi Kook, and wrote books about the
new Physics and Kabbalah,

177
00:09:15,660 --&gt; 00:09:17,570
and how they interrelate.

178
00:09:17,570 --&gt; 00:09:20,670
Books that have now recently been sort of
unearthed, I would say.

179
00:09:21,820 --&gt; 00:09:25,790
And so he's saying that time and space
themselves, the structures of cosmology,

180
00:09:25,790 --&gt; 00:09:30,390
are also a limited shadow of a higher
attainment of this free reality.

181
00:09:30,390 --&gt; 00:09:35,230
So this free reality, this deeper higher
reality, both deeper and higher

182
00:09:35,230 --&gt; 00:09:40,390
interesting metaphors, is beyond time and
space, not just beyond good and evil.

183
00:09:40,390 --&gt; 00:09:41,310
And now

184
00:09:41,310 --&gt; 00:09:42,360
the final sentences.

185
00:09:42,360 --&gt; 00:09:45,820
It is easy to understand that drawing
closer to the

186
00:09:45,820 --&gt; 00:09:49,530
absolute good and free will of divinity
develops all of existence.

187
00:09:49,530 --&gt; 00:09:51,840
Again, like [UNKNOWN], like [UNKNOWN].

188
00:09:51,840 --&gt; 00:09:55,750
The whole idea that, that when it gets
close to the cosmic soul,

189
00:09:55,750 --&gt; 00:10:00,090
then to the divine soul, then one really
uplifts the hole of reality.

190
00:10:00,090 --&gt; 00:10:02,850
The hole of reality will be transformed by
this.

191
00:10:02,850 --&gt; 00:10:05,100
It reveals the light of the individual
souls.

192
00:10:05,100 --&gt; 00:10:06,400
And this works back for a chain

193
00:10:06,400 --&gt; 00:10:09,530
of connection.
All the way back to the individuals soul.

194
00:10:09,530 --&gt; 00:10:12,440
That the individuals soul itself will
become developed.

195
00:10:12,440 --&gt; 00:10:17,440
Not in isolation but in connection to the
national, cosmic and divine levels.

196
00:10:17,440 --&gt; 00:10:21,440
Now, what I've done is read the text with
a few comments.

197
00:10:21,440 --&gt; 00:10:25,450
Soon we'll take it deeper.
We'll put it right to text in context.

198
00:10:25,450 --&gt; 00:10:28,570
But first, let's just absorb the text
itself, how radical it is.

199
00:10:28,570 --&gt; 00:10:29,700
How powerful it is in a way.
