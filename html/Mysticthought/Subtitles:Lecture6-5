1
00:00:01,000 --&gt; 00:00:03,850
I think we've got a sense of the main
psychological themes of this text.

2
00:00:03,850 --&gt; 00:00:07,350
Of course Bohme has many, many texts and
one can find parallel the differences.

3
00:00:07,350 --&gt; 00:00:09,730
And that's something one can work on as a
lot of it is online.

4
00:00:11,690 --&gt; 00:00:14,780
I want to focus on the interesting thing
which I haven't spoke about before.

5
00:00:15,920 --&gt; 00:00:18,220
Which is the visual aspect here.

6
00:00:18,220 --&gt; 00:00:21,960
If one glances through this text or others
and sees the images.

7
00:00:21,960 --&gt; 00:00:23,830
One sees many diagrams.

8
00:00:23,830 --&gt; 00:00:26,990
Which is part of alchemical writing, that
it has many diagrams.

9
00:00:26,990 --&gt; 00:00:31,120
But it's also part of Kabbalistic wri,
writing, especially in the modern period.

10
00:00:31,120 --&gt; 00:00:32,690
With print it becomes of course easier.

11
00:00:32,690 --&gt; 00:00:35,280
With the internet it becomes even easier.

12
00:00:35,280 --&gt; 00:00:38,560
And this is about Kabbalah's visual
culture.

13
00:00:38,560 --&gt; 00:00:42,470
There's a big research project at Haifa
University by Joseph Chajes.

14
00:00:42,470 --&gt; 00:00:47,106
It's Chajes.

15
00:00:47,106 --&gt; 00:00:52,410
And the visual culture of Kabbalah, all
these diagrams,

16
00:00:52,410 --&gt; 00:00:54,800
these charts that soon we'll go into it,
but

17
00:00:54,800 --&gt; 00:00:58,160
many, many Kabbalistic manuscripts are
full of these charts.

18
00:00:58,160 --&gt; 00:01:02,370
And develops in our century and the
previous century in

19
00:01:02,370 --&gt; 00:01:05,716
Kabbalistic art, there's a lot of art
that's using Kabbalistic imagery.

20
00:01:05,716 --&gt; 00:01:09,120
And I think, [INAUDIBLE] his art, which is
certainly influenced by Kabbalah.

21
00:01:09,120 --&gt; 00:01:12,590
He is a scholar who is also an artist.

22
00:01:12,590 --&gt; 00:01:16,580
There's a, a lot of this creativity,
artistic creativity.

23
00:01:16,580 --&gt; 00:01:18,350
And of course, one has to recall

24
00:01:18,350 --&gt; 00:01:21,070
that part of Freud's work is to work on
artists, because he

25
00:01:21,070 --&gt; 00:01:24,940
wants to study the creative process, of
genius, so he studies Da Vinci.

26
00:01:24,940 --&gt; 00:01:26,700
And there's a lot of literature.

27
00:01:26,700 --&gt; 00:01:32,220
And of psychoanalytic interpretation of
art, Peter Fuller and others there's a

28
00:01:32,220 --&gt; 00:01:36,420
whole corpus of writing about this, which
of course is very interesting.

29
00:01:36,420 --&gt; 00:01:40,510
Because the, the early 20th century with
the mystical movements

30
00:01:40,510 --&gt; 00:01:43,400
we've been speaking about, and a couple
lines on, and other

31
00:01:43,400 --&gt; 00:01:49,350
movements, together with the, Are people
who reflect on art, people like Robert

32
00:01:49,350 --&gt; 00:01:55,288
Cook, reflect on art and aesthetics, on
poetry, on poetics, related issues.

33
00:01:55,288 --&gt; 00:01:57,810
These people [INAUDIBLE] also think about
these issues in

34
00:01:57,810 --&gt; 00:02:01,270
India, and this is also great revolution
in modern arts.

35
00:02:01,270 --&gt; 00:02:04,330
In fact it essentially goes to new places.

36
00:02:04,330 --&gt; 00:02:06,180
So it all happens in the same creative
period

37
00:02:06,180 --&gt; 00:02:08,870
which is very much around happens in the
German

38
00:02:08,870 --&gt; 00:02:09,490
speaking world.

39
00:02:09,490 --&gt; 00:02:12,430
Again the spoken German genius in other
words about this.

40
00:02:12,430 --&gt; 00:02:15,280
I just want to balance what I was saying
before

41
00:02:15,280 --&gt; 00:02:18,370
and other figures that I mentioned in the
Fascist connections.

42
00:02:18,370 --&gt; 00:02:18,885
It's one.

43
00:02:18,885 --&gt; 00:02:21,370
This is the shadow to use the union term

44
00:02:21,370 --&gt; 00:02:23,448
of a tradition, but it also has it's
genius.

45
00:02:23,448 --&gt; 00:02:30,210
Now the, this visual culture is very
apparent in these

46
00:02:30,210 --&gt; 00:02:32,610
texts, in the diagrams, which are very
influenced by Kabbalah.

47
00:02:32,610 --&gt; 00:02:34,550
It's not the only source.

48
00:02:34,550 --&gt; 00:02:38,280
But especially, I want to focus on the
idea of lines and circles.

49
00:02:38,280 --&gt; 00:02:40,610
That the lines, of course, are related to
the cross.

50
00:02:40,610 --&gt; 00:02:42,970
It's traditional Christian symbolism.

51
00:02:42,970 --&gt; 00:02:47,710
But this combination of lines and circles
is very much part of 16th

52
00:02:47,710 --&gt; 00:02:51,900
century and post 16th century Capella
coming from Safed coming from Issac Luria.

53
00:02:51,900 --&gt; 00:02:54,690
This whole combination of an in all these
Lurianic

54
00:02:54,690 --&gt; 00:02:57,358
texts are full of these diagrams of lines
and circles.

55
00:02:57,358 --&gt; 00:03:01,194
Now, the

56
00:03:03,678 --&gt; 00:03:05,520
When we speak about the influence of
Kabbalah, I

57
00:03:05,520 --&gt; 00:03:10,700
want to speak about another influence
which is present here.

58
00:03:10,700 --&gt; 00:03:15,250
In the effects, which is that of Renaissance
Kabbalah, people like Ficino and

59
00:03:15,250 --&gt; 00:03:19,410
others who work from the soul who also
wrote treatises about the soul.

60
00:03:19,410 --&gt; 00:03:23,700
That's, not of an immediate influence of
impact of Lurianic Kabbalah.

61
00:03:23,700 --&gt; 00:03:26,690
This also earlier influences, translations
of

62
00:03:26,690 --&gt; 00:03:28,790
coming from Renaissance Kabbalah in Italy
and

63
00:03:28,790 --&gt; 00:03:31,920
other places.
It's another thing to factor in.

64
00:03:31,920 --&gt; 00:03:33,890
And, this is probably the wider picture we

65
00:03:33,890 --&gt; 00:03:35,900
need in order to appreciate something like
Bohme, but

66
00:03:35,900 --&gt; 00:03:37,820
what I'm saying also is that one should
look

67
00:03:37,820 --&gt; 00:03:39,660
not only at the text, but also at image.

68
00:03:39,660 --&gt; 00:03:40,840
Text and image.

69
00:03:40,840 --&gt; 00:03:42,720
Look which images.
What, what is the visual here?

70
00:03:43,940 --&gt; 00:03:45,900
Now the,

71
00:03:48,290 --&gt; 00:03:49,710
I want to go back to the question of a
soul,

72
00:03:49,710 --&gt; 00:03:52,995
having slightly digressed to speak about
the, the visual aspect here.

73
00:03:52,995 --&gt; 00:03:57,210
That the soul they say should not one
senses.

74
00:03:57,210 --&gt; 00:03:59,330
We moving away from the empirical.

75
00:03:59,330 --&gt; 00:04:01,460
This is a move very much developed in
Hillman.

76
00:04:01,460 --&gt; 00:04:04,340
We speaking about the world, we speaking
about cosmology, we speaking

77
00:04:04,340 --&gt; 00:04:08,120
about astrology, we speaking about the
elements, we speaking about alchemy.

78
00:04:08,120 --&gt; 00:04:10,660
We use into visual, we use in image as in
diagrams

79
00:04:10,660 --&gt; 00:04:13,910
to, to give us a sense they're not only
speaking about subjective

80
00:04:13,910 --&gt; 00:04:17,150
experience, we speaking about something
concrete, about the world, something

81
00:04:17,150 --&gt; 00:04:19,590
that you could take into everyday life in
some way.

82
00:04:19,590 --&gt; 00:04:24,300
However, its not in the, the narrow sense
of just looking at what you see, because

83
00:04:24,300 --&gt; 00:04:26,990
there's also mystical vision, there's,
there's eyes of

84
00:04:26,990 --&gt; 00:04:29,370
a soul, so to speak, that are opened here.

85
00:04:29,370 --&gt; 00:04:32,220
So he says one shouldn't go by external
senses.

86
00:04:32,220 --&gt; 00:04:34,340
And this is a strong reaction in German

87
00:04:34,340 --&gt; 00:04:38,680
philosophy against empiricism, against
looking only at the senses.

88
00:04:38,680 --&gt; 00:04:41,810
Against in some way the English tradition
of looking very much at the sense

89
00:04:41,810 --&gt; 00:04:43,550
that people like Kant and after very

90
00:04:43,550 --&gt; 00:04:46,200
much Nietzsche it speaks about English
blockheads.

91
00:04:46,200 --&gt; 00:04:48,730
My apologies to, for English viewers.

92
00:04:48,730 --&gt; 00:04:51,590
That's the act against the strong, common,

93
00:04:51,590 --&gt; 00:04:54,470
common sense, every day focus on the
senses.

94
00:04:54,470 --&gt; 00:04:58,060
And I think that this German mystical
tradition is part of this inclination.

95
00:04:59,150 --&gt; 00:05:02,080
Now, it says why shouldn't you follow the
senses?

96
00:05:02,080 --&gt; 00:05:03,850
Because the, soul must follow its

97
00:05:03,850 --&gt; 00:05:04,830
own nature.

98
00:05:04,830 --&gt; 00:05:07,270
The soul has to be interpreted by the
soul.

99
00:05:07,270 --&gt; 00:05:09,670
It's a theme which we've seen a lot.
The soul has to follow itself.

100
00:05:11,120 --&gt; 00:05:14,450
And of course it's religious, it's not
just psychological.

101
00:05:14,450 --&gt; 00:05:18,140
Because the soul's perfection is
contemplation of the divine, he says.

102
00:05:18,140 --&gt; 00:05:22,000
So if a soul is in, again always
Parallelism between the processes in the

103
00:05:22,000 --&gt; 00:05:28,970
soul and the processes in the divine.
However, what is important to

104
00:05:28,970 --&gt; 00:05:32,200
focus on here is how the psychic world is
in some

105
00:05:32,200 --&gt; 00:05:34,120
way, despite its interaction with the

106
00:05:34,120 --&gt; 00:05:36,420
external world, is very much
self-contained.

107
00:05:36,420 --&gt; 00:05:39,830
It has its own mystery and its own riches.

108
00:05:39,830 --&gt; 00:05:41,890
And again, I don't to be too
proximist.

109
00:05:41,890 --&gt; 00:05:46,760
There are long term, panoramic, pre-modern
influences here.

110
00:05:46,760 --&gt; 00:05:50,050
Tertullian, other church fathers,
Christian writing on

111
00:05:50,050 --&gt; 00:05:52,740
the soul, on the religious nature of the
soul.

112
00:05:52,740 --&gt; 00:05:54,310
There is a lot of earlier Christian

113
00:05:54,310 --&gt; 00:05:56,080
tradition being fed in here.

114
00:05:56,080 --&gt; 00:05:57,882
So don't just think about the immediate

115
00:05:57,882 --&gt; 00:06:00,120
influences of Luria Kabbalah and alchemy
and on.

116
00:06:00,120 --&gt; 00:06:02,330
We need to go further back, this is
somebody who is

117
00:06:02,330 --&gt; 00:06:06,270
deeply rooted in the German christian
tradition and its earliest sources.

118
00:06:07,370 --&gt; 00:06:11,040
It's always important when speaking about
mystics to remember the religious context.

119
00:06:11,040 --&gt; 00:06:14,540
It's not just psychology.
It's a strong religious element here.

120
00:06:14,540 --&gt; 00:06:20,110
Just like in Bill Parson's recent analysis of
August, Augustin, he emphasizes,

121
00:06:20,110 --&gt; 00:06:21,950
you have to look at the psychological but

122
00:06:21,950 --&gt; 00:06:25,460
also see in which religious tradition he's
in-bedded.

123
00:06:25,460 --&gt; 00:06:29,670
Now I want to speak about in congruent of
this part before we

124
00:06:29,670 --&gt; 00:06:34,590
move on to one last issue, I want to speak
about the political here.

125
00:06:34,590 --&gt; 00:06:38,490
Because German philosophy is very much
political and modern fort

126
00:06:38,490 --&gt; 00:06:41,880
generally is very publicized and we've
spoken about this a bit.

127
00:06:41,880 --&gt; 00:06:45,380
And Bohme has a range to some influence in
a certain

128
00:06:45,380 --&gt; 00:06:51,490
angle in psychoanalysis, sub-political
angle in psychoanalysis.

129
00:06:51,490 --&gt; 00:06:57,030
Because in psychoanalysis I think we've
always been into impulses.

130
00:06:57,030 --&gt; 00:07:02,660
One is the emancipatory impulse.

131
00:07:02,660 --&gt; 00:07:05,950
The idea that psychoanalysis comes to free
us from these

132
00:07:05,950 --&gt; 00:07:11,650
shackles of tradition, of religion maybe,
of conformism to outward authority.

133
00:07:11,650 --&gt; 00:07:13,980
We get to know ourselves more, we become
freer.

134
00:07:15,010 --&gt; 00:07:20,900
On the other hand psychoanalysis also
creates An adaptive

135
00:07:20,900 --&gt; 00:07:25,040
impulse because for instance, basically,
you have to sublimate desire.

136
00:07:25,040 --&gt; 00:07:28,100
And you have to maintain civilization.
And, it has discontent.

137
00:07:28,100 --&gt; 00:07:32,150
Civilization and its discontent, and the
discontent of sublimation.

138
00:07:32,150 --&gt; 00:07:34,110
We can't just act on our desires.

139
00:07:34,110 --&gt; 00:07:36,630
And it's a strong adaptive process.
We have to be able to work.

140
00:07:36,630 --&gt; 00:07:39,050
We have to be able to be, in
relationships.

141
00:07:39,050 --&gt; 00:07:40,930
So we have to in some way give up.

142
00:07:40,930 --&gt; 00:07:42,690
The fiery desires of our soul.

143
00:07:43,830 --&gt; 00:07:48,100
Now the second impulse, we conceive it as

144
00:07:48,100 --&gt; 00:07:51,430
relative of Freud, actually took Freudian
psychology and says.

145
00:07:51,430 --&gt; 00:07:54,470
Okay if you Freud speaks about the
unconscious, let's use

146
00:07:54,470 --&gt; 00:07:58,100
advertising to influence the conscious
which, of course, many people do.

147
00:07:58,100 --&gt; 00:07:59,520
I mean there's all kinds of countries,
which is

148
00:07:59,520 --&gt; 00:08:02,010
there's all kinds of silly legal
restrictions on psychoanalysis as

149
00:08:02,010 --&gt; 00:08:03,430
being one of them.

150
00:08:03,430 --&gt; 00:08:07,810
And, of course, the greatest hypnotists
are work, are broadcasting on tv

151
00:08:07,810 --&gt; 00:08:10,020
hours a day every evening using

152
00:08:10,020 --&gt; 00:08:14,340
hypnotic techniques to create subliminal
advertising etc.

153
00:08:14,340 --&gt; 00:08:16,740
Now repetitive techniques, primitive forms
of

154
00:08:16,740 --&gt; 00:08:19,300
hypnotic techniques but nerveless
effective, otherwise

155
00:08:19,300 --&gt; 00:08:23,650
they wouldn't be using them because the
profit motive it's very strong here.

156
00:08:23,650 --&gt; 00:08:25,220
so I am speaking in a slightly political

157
00:08:25,220 --&gt; 00:08:27,790
way because this is a political issue and
there

158
00:08:27,790 --&gt; 00:08:30,370
has always been these two forces in
psychoanalysis.

159
00:08:31,710 --&gt; 00:08:35,550
Now, the classic example of Bohme we see
how he aligns himself

160
00:08:35,550 --&gt; 00:08:40,620
with a fascist regime to some extent and
that is the first blatant example.

161
00:08:40,620 --&gt; 00:08:44,380
Which is very much covered up in a lot of
Jungian writing.

162
00:08:44,380 --&gt; 00:08:45,850
So, the,

163
00:08:48,080 --&gt; 00:08:51,260
Bohme was adapted to some, adopted by
some, to some extent.

164
00:08:51,260 --&gt; 00:08:52,880
And not just Bohme but generally the

165
00:08:52,880 --&gt; 00:08:55,990
mystical tradition by what's called the
left-wing Freudians.

166
00:08:55,990 --&gt; 00:08:59,220
The left-wing Freudians took the
emancipatory aspect

167
00:08:59,220 --&gt; 00:09:01,990
of psychoanalysis to somewhat to an
extreme.

168
00:09:01,990 --&gt; 00:09:03,770
People like, again in the German
tradition,

169
00:09:03,770 --&gt; 00:09:07,310
Herbert Marcuse, and afterwards, Norman
Brown in

170
00:09:07,310 --&gt; 00:09:10,410
America, who's the heir to this tradition,

171
00:09:10,410 --&gt; 00:09:13,990
took ideas from religious traditions, from
Luther, and

172
00:09:13,990 --&gt; 00:09:17,495
from people like Böhme, and from other
mystics.

173
00:09:17,495 --&gt; 00:09:21,210
And they used it as to point towards
emancipatory forces.

174
00:09:22,360 --&gt; 00:09:24,190
This whole idea of the fiery process

175
00:09:24,190 --&gt; 00:09:27,740
of creation, this alchemical fiery process
of creation,

176
00:09:27,740 --&gt; 00:09:32,990
was taken by people like Norman Brown, to
be a very strong evocation of desire.

177
00:09:32,990 --&gt; 00:09:35,300
To help people to find their own inner
fire.

178
00:09:35,300 --&gt; 00:09:37,190
To help people find their own desire.

179
00:09:37,190 --&gt; 00:09:39,200
To help, and to use this desire to
challenge

180
00:09:39,200 --&gt; 00:09:41,270
conformity, to challenge political
systems.

181
00:09:42,280 --&gt; 00:09:43,930
And this is very interesting development.

182
00:09:43,930 --&gt; 00:09:48,660
In the mid-20th century, in, in, in first
in Germany and then in the United States.

183
00:09:49,790 --&gt; 00:09:51,860
Which happens within the psychoanalytic
movement

184
00:09:51,860 --&gt; 00:09:53,750
so it's important to mention this.

185
00:09:53,750 --&gt; 00:09:55,070
Again, it's another example of how

186
00:09:55,070 --&gt; 00:09:57,820
the history of psychoanalysis interacts
with mysticism.

187
00:09:57,820 --&gt; 00:10:02,050
There are people who are working on this
today like Michael Eigen.

188
00:10:02,050 --&gt; 00:10:04,140
On the fiery processes,

189
00:10:04,140 --&gt; 00:10:06,120
and psychoanalysis and Kabbalah and so on.

190
00:10:06,120 --&gt; 00:10:08,450
But I think that Norman Brown, who is a
classical

191
00:10:08,450 --&gt; 00:10:11,260
scholar is, is a stronger source for this
kind of discussion.
