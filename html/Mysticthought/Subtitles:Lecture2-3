1
00:00:00,220 --&gt; 00:00:02,020
So now I want to move to the third

2
00:00:02,020 --&gt; 00:00:06,840
big wave of Kabbalah, which developed in
the 18th century.

3
00:00:06,840 --&gt; 00:00:08,800
Which is very important part of modernity.

4
00:00:08,800 --&gt; 00:00:12,710
A lot of modernity as we know it developed
in the 18th century.

5
00:00:12,710 --&gt; 00:00:15,020
Think about the American revolution, the

6
00:00:15,020 --&gt; 00:00:17,650
French revolution, the industrial
revolution, which is

7
00:00:17,650 --&gt; 00:00:21,500
more 19th century but actually began with
a steam engine in the 18th.

8
00:00:21,500 --&gt; 00:00:22,930
Think about the feminist revolution.

9
00:00:22,930 --&gt; 00:00:24,960
It took a long time to get going, but it
began,

10
00:00:24,960 --&gt; 00:00:29,690
actually, in the 18th century.
Think about newspapers, coffee houses, all

11
00:00:29,690 --&gt; 00:00:33,290
things today that we take for granted are
all 18th century developments.

12
00:00:34,360 --&gt; 00:00:41,880
Now, the Kabbalah also had very intense
development in the 18th century.

13
00:00:41,880 --&gt; 00:00:46,320
It's all based on 16th century, it all
goes back to Valley, to Luria.

14
00:00:46,320 --&gt; 00:00:49,000
He's a central figure of modern Kabbalah,
undoubtedly.

15
00:00:49,000 --&gt; 00:00:49,665
For me,

16
00:00:49,665 --&gt; 00:00:52,330
undoubtedly; there are people who might
think otherwise.

17
00:00:52,330 --&gt; 00:00:54,270
Even people who are close to me,
academically.

18
00:00:55,610 --&gt; 00:01:00,630
Now, the four movements, the, actually
five movements, really.

19
00:01:00,630 --&gt; 00:01:03,650
One of them is already beginning to end in
the 18th century.

20
00:01:03,650 --&gt; 00:01:07,100
Its movement which is the radical,
heretical movement

21
00:01:07,100 --&gt; 00:01:09,140
which attracted a lot of attention
especially from

22
00:01:09,140 --&gt; 00:01:11,260
girls from Salleh mosque, talked about
before, the

23
00:01:11,260 --&gt; 00:01:14,750
founder of the field, and there's a
Sabbatean

24
00:01:14,750 --&gt; 00:01:17,500
movement in the 17th century he was

25
00:01:17,500 --&gt; 00:01:21,510
a mystical messiah, went to very intense
psychological

26
00:01:21,510 --&gt; 00:01:23,920
travels I would say, episodes Well we

27
00:01:23,920 --&gt; 00:01:25,760
could call it bipolar, or something like
that.

28
00:01:25,760 --&gt; 00:01:28,340
It's a bit hard to project backwards from
modern catagories.

29
00:01:28,340 --&gt; 00:01:31,700
But, no doubt went through some kind of
psychiatric suffering.

30
00:01:31,700 --&gt; 00:01:40,710
And through that he broke in a way, with
the traditional normative Jewish codes and

31
00:01:41,870 --&gt; 00:01:44,700
Gave people the possibility of maybe going
against

32
00:01:44,700 --&gt; 00:01:47,940
the law sometimes in sexual areas and
other areas.

33
00:01:47,940 --&gt; 00:01:51,600
And he was eventually, though he got a lot
of support initially, and this

34
00:01:51,600 --&gt; 00:01:55,350
is being repressed later in the, in the
history of Kabbalism itself, and this

35
00:01:55,350 --&gt; 00:01:57,000
is one of Scholem's great innovations to

36
00:01:57,000 --&gt; 00:02:00,650
show how Sabbatities [INAUDIBLE] Can, the
Sabbatai

37
00:02:00,650 --&gt; 00:02:03,890
is like Sabbath here, so the planets,

38
00:02:03,890 --&gt; 00:02:06,870
the seventh planet, the planet of Sabbath,
Sabbatai,

39
00:02:06,870 --&gt; 00:02:08,400
which is Satan in, in Hebrew.

40
00:02:09,570 --&gt; 00:02:16,950
so, Sabbatai Zevi, he, in the 17th
century, goes through psychic suffering,

41
00:02:16,950 --&gt; 00:02:18,790
and his solution, the diagnosis he

42
00:02:18,790 --&gt; 00:02:22,290
gets from a The psychological Kabbalistic
[INAUDIBLE]

43
00:02:22,290 --&gt; 00:02:28,000
diagnostician that he goes to, Nathan of
Gaza, of Gaza also in,

44
00:02:28,000 --&gt; 00:02:32,160
in Palestine, yes no longer in, not in
Israel but in, in Palestine.

45
00:02:33,590 --&gt; 00:02:36,210
So Nathan, he's a young Kabbalist in the

46
00:02:36,210 --&gt; 00:02:39,260
tradition of Ali gives him this very
striking diagnosis.

47
00:02:39,260 --&gt; 00:02:44,470
He says, Your solution to your problem is
actually that you're the messiah.

48
00:02:44,470 --&gt; 00:02:46,940
You're going through the suffering of a
messiah inside your own soul.

49
00:02:46,940 --&gt; 00:02:49,600
It's a very interesting psychological
figure.

50
00:02:49,600 --&gt; 00:02:53,210
Both of them, as the, as a therapist and a
patient, so to speak.

51
00:02:53,210 --&gt; 00:02:56,430
But the whole Sabbatean movement fails
because it converts to

52
00:02:56,430 --&gt; 00:02:58,770
Islam, that's a long story I'm sure you've
heard about

53
00:02:58,770 --&gt; 00:03:00,880
at length.
And it's not really our topic.

54
00:03:00,880 --&gt; 00:03:03,100
And because [INAUDIBLE] did put such a lot
of energy to

55
00:03:03,100 --&gt; 00:03:06,350
it and afterwards his student you
delivered as I mentioned before.

56
00:03:06,350 --&gt; 00:03:08,920
I'm not really going to go into the stream
much especially

57
00:03:08,920 --&gt; 00:03:14,030
because in the 18th century to get
[INAUDIBLE] begins to fade out.

58
00:03:14,030 --&gt; 00:03:14,560
It's still there.

59
00:03:14,560 --&gt; 00:03:19,760
It goes underground after the failure of
[INAUDIBLE] Messianic project.

60
00:03:19,760 --&gt; 00:03:24,190
But still there in the 18th century.
since one of this five streams,

61
00:03:24,190 --&gt; 00:03:27,430
but before others, which I want to focus
on, and I only going to focus on two.

62
00:03:28,560 --&gt; 00:03:31,620
Cause one stream which is a very sort of

63
00:03:31,620 --&gt; 00:03:35,250
a stir, scholarly form of Kabbalah,
developed in a big

64
00:03:35,250 --&gt; 00:03:40,040
urban intellectual sense of Vilna,
Lithuania, Especially by Elijah Kramer,

65
00:03:40,040 --&gt; 00:03:43,740
who's usually known as the Gaon, the
genius of Vilna.

66
00:03:43,740 --&gt; 00:03:49,480
So that's one scene which I won't really
focus on much, just limits of time.

67
00:03:49,480 --&gt; 00:03:51,430
The other is, and also not to have

68
00:03:51,430 --&gt; 00:03:54,510
cognitive overload, the other is, and now
again

69
00:03:54,510 --&gt; 00:03:56,590
I won't focus on it, a really important

70
00:03:56,590 --&gt; 00:03:58,600
Kabbal that really develops the project of
Ali.

71
00:03:59,750 --&gt; 00:04:03,080
In the original sites, in Palestine, the
land of

72
00:04:03,080 --&gt; 00:04:05,820
Israel, in the 18th century, not in
Galilee, but

73
00:04:05,820 --&gt; 00:04:08,610
in Jerusalem, back in Jerusalem, he
doesn't come from

74
00:04:08,610 --&gt; 00:04:11,550
Jerusalem, but he works in Jerusalem in
the 18th century.

75
00:04:11,550 --&gt; 00:04:14,880
Rabbi Shalom Sharabi.
That's S

76
00:04:14,880 --&gt; 00:04:21,320
H A R A, but it's an A with an inflection,
[UNKNOWN] in Hebrew, B I.

77
00:04:21,320 --&gt; 00:04:25,600
Shalom Sharabi, usually known by his
acronym, for Rashash.

78
00:04:25,600 --&gt; 00:04:29,190
The Kabbalahists are very into acronyms.
Ari, Rashash, and so on.

79
00:04:30,730 --&gt; 00:04:34,430
now, I'm not going to focus on these two
figures.

80
00:04:34,430 --&gt; 00:04:36,480
Kramer and Sharabi were very important.

81
00:04:36,480 --&gt; 00:04:39,970
They've not been studied much.
I want to follow a bit more my

82
00:04:39,970 --&gt; 00:04:42,590
own work, and the mainstream of
scholarship.

83
00:04:42,590 --&gt; 00:04:43,680
In focusing on two figures.

84
00:04:44,920 --&gt; 00:04:49,780
One, Vets Shalom's main student Shaol
Tushbi worked

85
00:04:49,780 --&gt; 00:04:53,630
very intensely in the 70s, 80s, early 90s.

86
00:04:53,630 --&gt; 00:04:57,280
A very fascinating figure that I've just
devoted a Hebrew biography

87
00:04:57,280 --&gt; 00:05:01,480
to and several English articles that you
can find on my website.

88
00:05:01,480 --&gt; 00:05:03,750
That's Moshe Hayyim.

89
00:05:03,750 --&gt; 00:05:05,375
Those are two private names, we could

90
00:05:05,375 --&gt; 00:05:09,110
[INAUDIBLE] say Christian names in
Kabbalistic concept,

91
00:05:09,110 --&gt; 00:05:14,430
context, Luzzatto, that's Luzzatto, Moshe
Hayyim Luzzatto.

92
00:05:15,520 --&gt; 00:05:20,160
Italian Kabbalist as you can hear in the
name, of northern Italy in 18th century.

93
00:05:20,160 --&gt; 00:05:26,080
Now Lazzatto is somewhat leaning towards
the Sabbatean model.

94
00:05:26,080 --&gt; 00:05:30,310
It is a bit related to the history of
Sabbateenism as Tische pointed out.

95
00:05:30,310 --&gt; 00:05:34,380
And he also goes for all kinds of internal
developments.

96
00:05:34,380 --&gt; 00:05:37,840
Less dramatic than Champlates views less
depressive I would say.

97
00:05:37,840 --&gt; 00:05:40,280
But it test's it's balances.

98
00:05:40,280 --&gt; 00:05:43,920
And at a very early age, at the age
actually of 22

99
00:05:43,920 --&gt; 00:05:47,100
he also comes to sense that he's the
Messiah in some form.

100
00:05:48,120 --&gt; 00:05:50,960
And just like [UNKNOWN] because of that he
is afterwards

101
00:05:50,960 --&gt; 00:05:55,490
rejected by the mainstream of the Jewish
world, of the Jewish,

102
00:05:55,490 --&gt; 00:05:56,550
of the Kabbalistic world.

103
00:05:56,550 --&gt; 00:06:01,320
And has really quite a tragic life story,
and dies in, in his 40s.

104
00:06:01,320 --&gt; 00:06:03,480
He goes to Galilee, actually, and dies in
Galilee in the 40s.

105
00:06:04,630 --&gt; 00:06:10,320
However, unlike the Sabbagean movement,
Luzzatto is rehabilitated by

106
00:06:10,320 --&gt; 00:06:13,920
the Jewish world, by the Kabbalistic
world, and actually

107
00:06:13,920 --&gt; 00:06:17,180
one of his psychological masterpieces that
he writes, the

108
00:06:17,180 --&gt; 00:06:21,410
Path of the Just, in Hebrew, [FOREIGN],
becomes almost

109
00:06:21,410 --&gt; 00:06:22,610
canonical work.

110
00:06:22,610 --&gt; 00:06:24,950
But he studied in all traditional circles,
and not

111
00:06:24,950 --&gt; 00:06:27,490
just traditional of the Jewish world, to
this day.

112
00:06:28,520 --&gt; 00:06:30,970
Really a masterpiece of psychology in many
ways.

113
00:06:30,970 --&gt; 00:06:33,900
Not very Kaballah'istic, but more
psychological.

114
00:06:33,900 --&gt; 00:06:35,410
More stress on psychology than on
Kabbalah.

115
00:06:35,410 --&gt; 00:06:38,910
But still, Kaballah'istic psychology.

116
00:06:38,910 --&gt; 00:06:43,366
And he's rehabilitated in the Jewish
world, especially by Eleo Kramer.

117
00:06:43,366 --&gt; 00:06:46,610
The [UNKNOWN], the genius of Vilna,

118
00:06:46,610 --&gt; 00:06:50,405
who said that he would go by foot to study
all the way from Vilna to

119
00:06:50,405 --&gt; 00:06:54,120
[INAUDIBLE], which is quite a way, even if
you take a train these days, to study.

120
00:06:54,120 --&gt; 00:06:57,980
But he would go by foot in order to study
with him if he was alive.

121
00:06:57,980 --&gt; 00:07:00,090
Almost a sort of regret, psychologically
speaking.

122
00:07:00,090 --&gt; 00:07:02,710
[INAUDIBLE] a sense of lack, of absence,
of loss.

123
00:07:04,160 --&gt; 00:07:07,050
As if Jewish people had also missed
something by rejecting Luzzatto.

124
00:07:08,470 --&gt; 00:07:11,870
So Moshe Luzzatto, just like [INAUDIBLE],
he develops

125
00:07:11,870 --&gt; 00:07:13,250
a circle.

126
00:07:13,250 --&gt; 00:07:16,790
He develops, a group of young Kabbalists,

127
00:07:16,790 --&gt; 00:07:19,060
students, and this is interesting for
students.

128
00:07:19,060 --&gt; 00:07:20,900
University students.

129
00:07:20,900 --&gt; 00:07:24,550
That study medicine in the University of
Padua in Northern Italy, they allow

130
00:07:24,550 --&gt; 00:07:27,900
Jews to study there, which is not to be
taken for granted, even

131
00:07:27,900 --&gt; 00:07:29,780
in the 18th century, and they

132
00:07:29,780 --&gt; 00:07:32,210
clustered around Luzzatto, around this
charismatic figure,

133
00:07:33,350 --&gt; 00:07:37,160
himself didn't go to university, devoted
himself from a very, very early age,

134
00:07:37,160 --&gt; 00:07:38,570
maybe 15, to Kabbalah.

135
00:07:39,790 --&gt; 00:07:42,370
And that's the age in which I started to
study in Kabbalah, by the way.

136
00:07:43,570 --&gt; 00:07:47,110
And he really immerses himself in
Kabbalaha,

137
00:07:47,110 --&gt; 00:07:50,410
develops this mystical, messianic
psychology one could say.

138
00:07:50,410 --&gt; 00:07:53,450
Him and his associates and close friends
and students.

139
00:07:53,450 --&gt; 00:07:55,620
Before the circle is disbanded by
persecution.

140
00:07:57,890 --&gt; 00:07:59,870
And Luzzatto, I won't go much into the

141
00:07:59,870 --&gt; 00:08:03,510
details of his psychological thought, just
to really recommend,

142
00:08:03,510 --&gt; 00:08:05,110
if you've got a chance, it's been
translated, to

143
00:08:05,110 --&gt; 00:08:07,170
look at Mesilat Yesharim, because it's
really a classic.

144
00:08:08,730 --&gt; 00:08:12,600
Now, I'll speak briefly now about the
fourth movement, and then

145
00:08:12,600 --&gt; 00:08:14,750
we'll go into it in a bit more detail,
because it's in

146
00:08:14,750 --&gt; 00:08:18,340
many ways In terms of modern Kabbalah, for
most studied, the

147
00:08:18,340 --&gt; 00:08:23,100
most researched, the most popular known
movement that has really been popularized

148
00:08:23,100 --&gt; 00:08:27,710
by another person from the central
European, early 20th century Jewish

149
00:08:27,710 --&gt; 00:08:31,390
world, Martin Bubba, who later became a
professor here in Jerusalem.

150
00:08:33,040 --&gt; 00:08:36,210
And Also popularized by people that may

151
00:08:36,210 --&gt; 00:08:40,009
have heard of, later, in the American
world...

152
00:08:40,009 --&gt; 00:08:44,968
[UNKNOWN] [UNKNOWN] a writer,
Jewish-American writer.

153
00:08:44,968 --&gt; 00:08:48,180
Out of...important American Jewish figures
really

154
00:08:48,180 --&gt; 00:08:50,470
popularized the Hassidic world.

155
00:08:50,470 --&gt; 00:08:54,660
And the world of Hasidism is the fourth,
or fifth, actually, besides Sabbateanism.

156
00:08:54,660 --&gt; 00:08:57,340
Major movement develops out of the
teachings [UNKNOWN].

157
00:08:57,340 --&gt; 00:09:01,633
A bit less of [UNKNOWN] than the others.
A bit less focused than [UNKNOWN].

158
00:09:01,633 --&gt; 00:09:04,766
Because [UNKNOWN] system, [UNKNOWN] system
is very complex, very difficult.

159
00:09:04,766 --&gt; 00:09:07,320
[UNKNOWN] understood maybe 50% of it.

160
00:09:07,320 --&gt; 00:09:08,470
That's pretty good, actually.

161
00:09:09,530 --&gt; 00:09:10,610
And.

162
00:09:10,610 --&gt; 00:09:13,320
The Hassidic movement really wants to turn
Kabbalah

163
00:09:13,320 --&gt; 00:09:16,550
into a social movement, we're not speaking
here only about

164
00:09:16,550 --&gt; 00:09:20,280
social psychology, about small circles, or
fellowships like circle of

165
00:09:20,280 --&gt; 00:09:24,290
Luzzatto, the circle of Shalabi, the
circle of Krama, the

166
00:09:24,290 --&gt; 00:09:28,630
circle of Ari, of Kultiverro, we're
speaking about a mass movement.

167
00:09:28,630 --&gt; 00:09:33,360
We're speaking about a movement that takes
over 50% of big parts of the Eastern

168
00:09:33,360 --&gt; 00:09:38,960
European world in a matter of 20 years or
so, so which spreads like wildfire

169
00:09:38,960 --&gt; 00:09:42,260
in the Jewish world of the late 18th,
early 19th century.

170
00:09:42,260 --&gt; 00:09:46,380
With tremendous appeal to wide circles, to
scholars also, not

171
00:09:46,380 --&gt; 00:09:50,070
just to the masses, people once thought
mostly to the masses.

172
00:09:50,070 --&gt; 00:09:51,990
Not true, also to scholars.

173
00:09:51,990 --&gt; 00:09:54,970
However, also to the masses, to people who
barely know

174
00:09:54,970 --&gt; 00:09:57,190
how to read, who certainly don't know how
to read Hebrew.

175
00:09:57,190 --&gt; 00:10:00,190
In distant villages, all over Poland, what

176
00:10:00,190 --&gt; 00:10:03,750
is today Poland, Lithuania, Russia,
Romania, Hungary.

177
00:10:05,570 --&gt; 00:10:09,610
And in Eastern Central Europe, the hacidic
movement becomes very powerful.

178
00:10:10,680 --&gt; 00:10:14,910
The trends tempered out, just like the
authorities, just like with [UNKNOWN].

179
00:10:14,910 --&gt; 00:10:18,060
The Vilna Gaon, Kremer, he excommunicates
the Hasidim.

180
00:10:19,340 --&gt; 00:10:22,410
However, it doesn't work, because when
they become 50% or more

181
00:10:22,410 --&gt; 00:10:25,840
in some places, you can't excommunicate
half of the Jewish people.

182
00:10:25,840 --&gt; 00:10:27,220
So, they accept it.

183
00:10:27,220 --&gt; 00:10:30,800
And today we're actually The very strong
part of the conservative part

184
00:10:30,800 --&gt; 00:10:33,700
of the traditional Jewish world may be

185
00:10:33,700 --&gt; 00:10:35,620
less conservative than we might think
though.

186
00:10:35,620 --&gt; 00:10:36,520
That I'll speak about later.

187
00:10:36,520 --&gt; 00:10:39,740
So this is the fourth or fifth movement,
the Hassidic

188
00:10:39,740 --&gt; 00:10:43,430
movement, developing in more as we see Al
Vaceen moves safer

189
00:10:43,430 --&gt; 00:10:47,120
and in Italy and in other places more in
Central Europe,

190
00:10:47,120 --&gt; 00:10:50,420
and then we move sort of northward and
deep into Russia.

191
00:10:50,420 --&gt; 00:10:52,760
You create the Ukraine, et cetera, the,
the

192
00:10:52,760 --&gt; 00:10:55,990
Baltic states, and we have a very strong,

193
00:10:55,990 --&gt; 00:11:00,280
powerful social movement, again focused on
charismatic figures, just like

194
00:11:00,280 --&gt; 00:11:03,900
with the circles, just like with the
fellowships but much wider.

195
00:11:03,900 --&gt; 00:11:09,950
We've got [INAUDIBLE] Kim, the Webbers,
the mystics, and mystical psychologists.

196
00:11:09,950 --&gt; 00:11:11,880
A great part of the attraction, the
charisma, the

197
00:11:11,880 --&gt; 00:11:14,800
power of [UNKNOWN] is the ability to
diagnose, like [UNKNOWN].

198
00:11:14,800 --&gt; 00:11:19,210
And to give, repair, but to do it in a
much more simple level.

199
00:11:19,210 --&gt; 00:11:20,780
To speak to people's everyday concerns.

200
00:11:20,780 --&gt; 00:11:26,110
The concerns about finding a match, the
concerns about having children, the

201
00:11:26,110 --&gt; 00:11:28,450
concerns about raising children, about
finding

202
00:11:28,450 --&gt; 00:11:31,240
livelihood in difficult economic
conditions, about health.

203
00:11:31,240 --&gt; 00:11:35,040
So they're speaking ot people about their
lives, in a way like pscyoanalysts do.

204
00:11:35,040 --&gt; 00:11:38,270
Not just about their spiritual lives.
And this is the power of Hasidic movement.
