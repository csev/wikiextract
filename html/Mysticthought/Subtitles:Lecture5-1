2
00:00:03,184 --&gt; 00:00:08,083
So, today we're going to speak about the
Religion of the Heart, which is a 17th

3
00:00:08,083 --&gt; 00:00:11,562
to 18th century phenomenon, even though,
of course,

4
00:00:11,562 --&gt; 00:00:14,834
we'll see, it has earlier roots and later
branches.

5
00:00:14,834 --&gt; 00:00:17,942
Now the term, Religion of the Heart, I'm
taking

6
00:00:17,942 --&gt; 00:00:21,050
from Ted Campbell's book by that title,
which is

7
00:00:21,050 --&gt; 00:00:24,306
really a short, but important study
because what he

8
00:00:24,306 --&gt; 00:00:28,820
does is he brings together the Catholic
and Protestant worlds.

9
00:00:28,820 --&gt; 00:00:33,080
And even with some comments about
parallels to Hasidism and to

10
00:00:33,080 --&gt; 00:00:36,470
Hesychasm, which are very interesting in
view of our previous classes.

11
00:00:38,210 --&gt; 00:00:42,200
Now, what we going to do now is speak
mostly about

12
00:00:42,200 --&gt; 00:00:46,380
the Catholic and the Protestant world in
the 17th and 18th centuries.

13
00:00:46,380 --&gt; 00:00:49,300
Because as we said in one of the previous
lectures, one of

14
00:00:49,300 --&gt; 00:00:53,770
the important traditions in modernity, is
that in the 16th century we have

15
00:00:55,220 --&gt; 00:01:00,330
the Reformation and then we have the
Protestant world which begins to develop

16
00:01:00,330 --&gt; 00:01:03,310
and really creates a new religious culture

17
00:01:03,310 --&gt; 00:01:05,970
inside the heart of Christianity in
Europe.

18
00:01:05,970 --&gt; 00:01:09,195
And then as a response, but not only as a
response, also

19
00:01:09,195 --&gt; 00:01:11,920
continuing earlier developments, we have
what

20
00:01:11,920 --&gt; 00:01:14,540
sometimes people call the Counter
Reformation.

21
00:01:14,540 --&gt; 00:01:17,410
I prefer the term, the Catholic Revival.

22
00:01:17,410 --&gt; 00:01:20,470
That is, the Protestant world really
challenged the Catholic

23
00:01:20,470 --&gt; 00:01:24,620
world to develop certain spiritual
tendencies.

24
00:01:24,620 --&gt; 00:01:26,860
So this competition--competition is also
good for

25
00:01:26,860 --&gt; 00:01:30,100
the mystical business, not just for
ordinary business--

26
00:01:30,100 --&gt; 00:01:34,445
so this competition between the Protestant
and Catholic worlds, as it develops in the

27
00:01:34,445 --&gt; 00:01:40,618
17th, 18th centuries, really intensifies
the mystical

28
00:01:40,618 --&gt; 00:01:46,240
discourse, writing and teaching in
Europe.

29
00:01:46,240 --&gt; 00:01:50,720
And, and of course the psychological realm
because part of the Protestant

30
00:01:50,720 --&gt; 00:01:56,030
revolution, the revolution of reformation,
is a greater focus on the individual,

31
00:01:58,530 --&gt; 00:02:00,614
on the individual conscience, on the
individual soul

32
00:02:00,614 --&gt; 00:02:03,490
searching, to move the focus of religious
life

33
00:02:03,490 --&gt; 00:02:06,290
a bit away from the establishment, from
the

34
00:02:06,290 --&gt; 00:02:11,420
church, from the, the priesthood towards
the individual believer.

35
00:02:11,420 --&gt; 00:02:16,580
For instance, the idea that one doesn't
get absolution of sins from confession to

36
00:02:16,580 --&gt; 00:02:20,320
a priest, but one has to really work it
out inside one's own conscience.

37
00:02:20,320 --&gt; 00:02:23,870
It's a very Protestant idea.
Now, this is a complex

38
00:02:23,870 --&gt; 00:02:28,540
picture with various streams in the
Catholic--the Protestant world so I

39
00:02:28,540 --&gt; 00:02:31,590
won't go into all that, just to give a
very general outline.

40
00:02:31,590 --&gt; 00:02:39,220
Now, one of the important phases in the
Catholic revival was the Jesuit movement.

41
00:02:39,220 --&gt; 00:02:41,670
And, especially, one has to pay attention
to the

42
00:02:41,670 --&gt; 00:02:46,080
founder, Ignatius of Loyola, and his book
The Spiritual Exercises.

43
00:02:46,080 --&gt; 00:02:48,990
which is one of the great mystical and
spiritual classics.

44
00:02:50,040 --&gt; 00:02:51,990
We'll speak in the later class on the

45
00:02:51,990 --&gt; 00:02:55,970
reception of his books, through today,
because many people

46
00:02:55,970 --&gt; 00:02:59,600
who conduct their inner lives through
retreats and

47
00:02:59,600 --&gt; 00:03:04,500
through self help books etc, by these
spiritual exercises.

48
00:03:04,500 --&gt; 00:03:06,630
And Ignacio is really an interesting
figure,

49
00:03:06,630 --&gt; 00:03:09,470
a Spanish figure, who comes from a military
background,

50
00:03:10,670 --&gt; 00:03:15,020
goes through a conversion experience, and
sets up the order, which is still with us,

51
00:03:15,020 --&gt; 00:03:18,610
a very powerful order intellectually,
organizationally.

52
00:03:18,610 --&gt; 00:03:22,920
It has universities school, many schools,
etc.

53
00:03:22,920 --&gt; 00:03:27,220
A very powerful force within the Catholic
Church, not always a--with a

54
00:03:27,220 --&gt; 00:03:32,940
easy relationship to the to the Pope, to
the central establishment of the church.

55
00:03:32,940 --&gt; 00:03:37,360
Really a very interesting phenomenon and
much written that

56
00:03:37,360 --&gt; 00:03:40,290
you can find easily on the Jesuit movement
and

57
00:03:40,290 --&gt; 00:03:43,480
especially on Ignatius and the Spiritual
Exercises.

58
00:03:43,480 --&gt; 00:03:46,000
Now, what's interesting about the
spiritual

59
00:03:46,000 --&gt; 00:03:49,760
exercises is the focus on the imagination.

60
00:03:49,760 --&gt; 00:03:51,810
In contemporary terms, one can--one could almost
say

61
00:03:51,810 --&gt; 00:03:56,545
that the exercises are exercises in guided
imagination.

62
00:03:56,545 --&gt; 00:03:59,830
That is how to use the imagination to make
the

63
00:03:59,830 --&gt; 00:04:05,290
themes of the religious, of the spiritual
life, more compelling, emotionally.

64
00:04:05,290 --&gt; 00:04:08,550
So the movement is to imagine and to
work on the emotions, a

65
00:04:08,550 --&gt; 00:04:14,260
bit like hypnosis, and other methods, the
Jungian method of active imagination.

66
00:04:15,320 --&gt; 00:04:18,940
Now, The Spiritual Exercises is really, in
sociological

67
00:04:18,940 --&gt; 00:04:22,430
terms we can call it social construction
of emotion.

68
00:04:22,430 --&gt; 00:04:27,030
The idea is to rebuild the--the psychic
life of

69
00:04:27,030 --&gt; 00:04:30,300
a believer through a very organized--this
is his military

70
00:04:30,300 --&gt; 00:04:32,620
background, I guess, and the Jesuits are
very, very good

71
00:04:32,620 --&gt; 00:04:35,150
at organization, very organized--very

72
00:04:35,150 --&gt; 00:04:38,940
systematic, thorough training of the
imagination.

73
00:04:38,940 --&gt; 00:04:40,760
So this is just a bit of background.

74
00:04:40,760 --&gt; 00:04:43,670
We--we've not--haven't really reached the
heart of the Religion of the Heart, but

75
00:04:43,670 --&gt; 00:04:45,752
this is really the background in terms of

76
00:04:45,752 --&gt; 00:04:48,290
the Reformation, in terms of the Catholic
Revival.

77
00:04:49,310 --&gt; 00:04:55,620
Now, there's a very important theme in
this whole Catholic Revival, the idea

78
00:04:55,620 --&gt; 00:04:57,660
of redirection of desire.

79
00:04:57,660 --&gt; 00:05:01,450
That is we're not--it's not so much about
combating desire, there is an element

80
00:05:01,450 --&gt; 00:05:03,360
of spiritual warfare, which is a term
which

81
00:05:03,360 --&gt; 00:05:05,920
will recur a lot today in this class.

82
00:05:05,920 --&gt; 00:05:07,420
There is an element of combating one's

83
00:05:07,420 --&gt; 00:05:09,890
desires, but there's also an element of
redirecting.

84
00:05:09,890 --&gt; 00:05:15,390
So, you've got desire, redirected from the
earthly things to spiritual matters.

85
00:05:15,390 --&gt; 00:05:20,810
This is like the Freudian idea of
sublimation of Eros.  You've got libido,

86
00:05:20,810 --&gt; 00:05:24,180
or Eros, or desire really, and you redirect
it.

87
00:05:24,180 --&gt; 00:05:25,460
This is the whole work of culture

88
00:05:25,460 --&gt; 00:05:28,750
according to Freud, that we redirect it from
physical desire

89
00:05:28,750 --&gt; 00:05:31,310
to more intellectual libido, like we do

90
00:05:31,310 --&gt; 00:05:36,950
in academia and to other creative projects
etc.

91
00:05:36,950 --&gt; 00:05:40,220
So in the context of the Catholic Revival,
we have the idea

92
00:05:40,220 --&gt; 00:05:42,335
of the redirection of desire in

93
00:05:42,335 --&gt; 00:05:46,600
Ignatius and other writings towards
spiritual goals.

94
00:05:46,600 --&gt; 00:05:48,730
And this is really, looking back to

95
00:05:48,730 --&gt; 00:05:52,020
earlier classes, a very important theme of
Hasidism,

96
00:05:52,020 --&gt; 00:05:56,010
Izbiche Hasidism, that we spoke about, of
my ancestors.

97
00:05:56,010 --&gt; 00:06:00,920
The idea that desire is not negative but
one has to redirect it.

98
00:06:00,920 --&gt; 00:06:05,690
And here we see a very modern idea of not
combating desire, of sublimating it.

99
00:06:05,690 --&gt; 00:06:06,940
We see how it appears in

100
00:06:06,940 --&gt; 00:06:11,680
various contexts, religious, so-called
secular, like psychoanalysis.

101
00:06:11,680 --&gt; 00:06:15,130
And this I think really reinforces our
general thesis about

102
00:06:17,190 --&gt; 00:06:19,000
psychology in European modernity.
