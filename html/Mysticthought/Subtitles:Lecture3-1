00:00:03,750 --&gt; 00:00:10,090
In previous lesson we discussed the lost
big wave of Kabbalistic writing of

2
00:00:10,090 --&gt; 00:00:13,590
Kabbalistic life activity in the 20th

3
00:00:13,590 --&gt; 00:00:16,440
Century and the beginnings of present
century

4
00:00:16,440 --&gt; 00:00:23,060
of 21st and we focused on We spoke about
the figure of,

5
00:00:23,060 --&gt; 00:00:27,090
two main figures, really, that I discussed
in my book on the 20th century Kabbalah.

6
00:00:27,090 --&gt; 00:00:27,850
One is Rabbi

7
00:00:27,850 --&gt; 00:00:30,420
Ashlag, Yehuda Leib Ashlag.

8
00:00:30,420 --&gt; 00:00:34,740
And the other, who we'll focus on today,
Rabbi Abraham Isaac Cook.

9
00:00:34,740 --&gt; 00:00:39,060
Now I'm speaking about the first period of
the 20th century.

10
00:00:39,060 --&gt; 00:00:41,350
That is Rabbi Kook dies in the 30s, Rabbi
Ashlag in the 50s.

11
00:00:41,350 --&gt; 00:00:44,340
So we're speaking about the first half of
the 20th

12
00:00:44,340 --&gt; 00:00:49,300
century, the half which really precedes
the second world war.

13
00:00:49,300 --&gt; 00:00:52,915
And towards the end of the lesson we'll
speak about the second half of the

14
00:00:52,915 --&gt; 00:00:57,190
20th century and the beginnings, of
course, of our century in one continuity.

15
00:00:57,190 --&gt; 00:00:57,800
Now.

16
00:00:58,820 --&gt; 00:01:00,350
The first half of 20th century is

17
00:01:00,350 --&gt; 00:01:03,770
very important in terms of psychological
thought.

18
00:01:03,770 --&gt; 00:01:07,660
There's very strong development, of
course, of psychoanalysis around the end

19
00:01:07,660 --&gt; 00:01:10,750
of the nineteenth and the first part of
the 20th century.

20
00:01:10,750 --&gt; 00:01:13,920
Freud and Jung and others other forms

21
00:01:13,920 --&gt; 00:01:19,160
of psychology, the beginnings of cognitive
psychology.

22
00:01:19,160 --&gt; 00:01:23,550
The Gestalt psychology, very, certain
developments in, in brain science,

23
00:01:23,550 --&gt; 00:01:27,000
which are related of course to psychology
and so on.

24
00:01:27,000 --&gt; 00:01:31,140
There's also development of psychological
thought in the discipline of sociology.

25
00:01:31,140 --&gt; 00:01:32,280
We mentioned Max Weber.

26
00:01:33,510 --&gt; 00:01:38,210
And also, a, a strong interest in
psychology of religion.

27
00:01:38,210 --&gt; 00:01:40,730
For instance, William James, a classic for
Varieties

28
00:01:40,730 --&gt; 00:01:44,300
of Religious Experience, the beginning of
the 20th century.

29
00:01:44,300 --&gt; 00:01:47,820
As of a strong discussion as part of his
general interest

30
00:01:47,820 --&gt; 00:01:51,850
in psychology, in the psychology of
religion, and especially of mysticism.

31
00:01:53,230 --&gt; 00:01:58,100
Now, what's interesting is that we also
have a big revival, of mysticism

32
00:01:58,100 --&gt; 00:02:01,310
around the turn of the century, of the
beginning of the 20th century.

33
00:02:01,310 --&gt; 00:02:04,910
Afterwards it gets weakened a bit because
of the two world wars.

34
00:02:04,910 --&gt; 00:02:08,870
And generally when there's wars going on
people have a bit less time for mysticism.

35
00:02:08,870 --&gt; 00:02:13,370
However, before the first world war we
have the strong revival

36
00:02:13,370 --&gt; 00:02:17,424
of, of Christian Kabbalah in London and
elsewhere and Jewish Kabbalah.

37
00:02:17,424 --&gt; 00:02:22,090
And [INAUDIBLE] cook Are really part of
this development, and other

38
00:02:22,090 --&gt; 00:02:25,060
Kabbalistic figures that we won't be able
to go into today.

39
00:02:25,060 --&gt; 00:02:28,670
In other places, in Baghdad in [INAUDIBLE]
and so on.

40
00:02:29,910 --&gt; 00:02:33,900
However, these two figures are, in my
view, certainly in terms of reception,

41
00:02:33,900 --&gt; 00:02:39,450
the two central figures of 20th century
Kabbalah.

42
00:02:39,450 --&gt; 00:02:44,310
They represent two poles in the general
development of modern Kabbalah.

43
00:02:44,310 --&gt; 00:02:46,470
That, one can say that modern Kabbalah, if

44
00:02:46,470 --&gt; 00:02:48,320
we focus for a moment on modern
psychology,

45
00:02:50,340 --&gt; 00:02:55,030
really develops two directions.
One is social psychology.

46
00:02:55,030 --&gt; 00:02:57,830
In the Hasidic world that we spoke about,
beginning in the 18th

47
00:02:57,830 --&gt; 00:02:59,840
century, continuing to develop in the

48
00:02:59,840 --&gt; 00:03:02,740
19th, continuing in the early 20th
century.

49
00:03:02,740 --&gt; 00:03:04,690
We spoke about the school that my own
ancestors

50
00:03:04,690 --&gt; 00:03:10,890
belonged to, [FOREIGN] in Poland, late
19th, early 20th century.

51
00:03:10,890 --&gt; 00:03:15,450
We have thought which is focused on group,
the group of a

52
00:03:15,450 --&gt; 00:03:19,050
Hassidim, the group of devotees, focused
on a charismatic individual.

53
00:03:21,930 --&gt; 00:03:23,910
And the focus is not national.

54
00:03:23,910 --&gt; 00:03:26,690
It's not in the Jewish nation, it's on
communities.

55
00:03:26,690 --&gt; 00:03:29,510
It's on the Hasidic communities.

56
00:03:29,510 --&gt; 00:03:33,480
And that's why Hasidic texts, from the
very beginning, have a lot of discussion

57
00:03:33,480 --&gt; 00:03:37,060
of love of one's fellow, usually fellow

58
00:03:37,060 --&gt; 00:03:40,730
Jew, but sometimes more generally fellow
human being.

59
00:03:40,730 --&gt; 00:03:42,990
And relations between the group.

60
00:03:42,990 --&gt; 00:03:47,610
And developing social relations and
developing one's psychological

61
00:03:47,610 --&gt; 00:03:52,160
inter work in the context of the group.
So, one can call this social psychology.

62
00:03:53,790 --&gt; 00:03:55,890
And we spoke about Rabbi Ashlag's rather

63
00:03:55,890 --&gt; 00:03:59,140
Socialist interpretation of Kabbalah
Focusing on a

64
00:03:59,140 --&gt; 00:04:04,460
problem of transcending the ego, the will
to receive, developing the will to give.

65
00:04:04,460 --&gt; 00:04:07,110
Developing, and as his successors, his
son,

66
00:04:07,110 --&gt; 00:04:09,570
Rabbi Baruch Ashlag put it, through the
group.

67
00:04:09,570 --&gt; 00:04:12,630
And also today, Rabbi Lightman is

68
00:04:12,630 --&gt; 00:04:17,370
also developing this direction of
developing one's social

69
00:04:17,370 --&gt; 00:04:21,420
self, really, at the expense of the
individual ego.

70
00:04:21,420 --&gt; 00:04:26,450
And through this, looking towards making
some larger social change.

71
00:04:26,450 --&gt; 00:04:28,650
Which for [UNKNOWN] was in a socialist
direction.

72
00:04:28,650 --&gt; 00:04:31,240
Of course, we've got the paradox that some
of

73
00:04:31,240 --&gt; 00:04:35,566
these successes took it in a very
capitalist [UNKNOWN] direction.

74
00:04:35,566 --&gt; 00:04:37,736
That's one of the paradoxes

75
00:04:37,736 --&gt; 00:04:39,760
of history.
Now, this is one direction.

76
00:04:39,760 --&gt; 00:04:41,890
This direction of social psychology.

77
00:04:41,890 --&gt; 00:04:45,830
However, we also have a direction of
national psychology.

78
00:04:45,830 --&gt; 00:04:50,600
Beginning in 18th century texts, in the
circle of Luzzatto, which we spoke

79
00:04:50,600 --&gt; 00:04:55,460
about, in the circle of Reb Kramer, in, in
Vilna that we spoke about.

80
00:04:55,460 --&gt; 00:04:58,580
The idea of the soul of a nation.

81
00:04:58,580 --&gt; 00:05:03,630
We're speaking here about The idea of the
soul of the Jewish people.

82
00:05:03,630 --&gt; 00:05:05,250
Now here, I want to get into one of these

83
00:05:05,250 --&gt; 00:05:08,740
thorny issues, from a modern perspective,
from our perspective, really.

84
00:05:09,790 --&gt; 00:05:15,450
That, just like with the case of gender,
one cannot occlude,

85
00:05:15,450 --&gt; 00:05:20,010
and create apologetics around the fact
That

86
00:05:20,010 --&gt; 00:05:24,640
Kabbalahistic discourse assigns
superiority to the Jewish people and

87
00:05:24,640 --&gt; 00:05:27,690
if you're speaking about psychology, to
the Jewish soul.

88
00:05:27,690 --&gt; 00:05:28,750
And Elliot Wolfson has

89
00:05:28,750 --&gt; 00:05:33,760
a book about it, Venturing Beyond.
And I think his point is well taken.

90
00:05:34,790 --&gt; 00:05:38,120
For my point of view as a modernist, I
would say.

91
00:05:38,120 --&gt; 00:05:41,050
I stress how this has developed in the
modern period more.

92
00:05:41,050 --&gt; 00:05:44,950
How this intensifies in the modern period.
It's also found in the premodern period.

93
00:05:44,950 --&gt; 00:05:47,280
But it intensifies in the modern period,

94
00:05:47,280 --&gt; 00:05:49,660
especially from the 18th, 19th century
onwards.

95
00:05:50,800 --&gt; 00:05:54,390
Now, of course, national psychology, not
just Kabbalah

96
00:05:54,390 --&gt; 00:05:58,810
gets a very big boost With the nationalist
revival

97
00:05:58,810 --&gt; 00:06:04,170
of mid and later modernities, the
development of nation states.

98
00:06:04,170 --&gt; 00:06:09,400
The emergence of new nation states, Italy,
Germany, somewhat earlier, one

99
00:06:09,400 --&gt; 00:06:12,770
can speak about the United States, really,
end of the 18th century.

100
00:06:12,770 --&gt; 00:06:17,210
The reorganization of France as a nation
state in the Napoleonic period.

101
00:06:17,210 --&gt; 00:06:19,640
So nationalism gets much stronger,

102
00:06:19,640 --&gt; 00:06:21,250
as modernity progresses.

103
00:06:21,250 --&gt; 00:06:22,570
Of course, the height of nationalism is

104
00:06:22,570 --&gt; 00:06:25,600
the second world war, somewhat before
that.

105
00:06:25,600 --&gt; 00:06:28,330
And after that it becomes somewhat less
fashionable, but still pretty strong.

106
00:06:29,410 --&gt; 00:06:30,850
Now the,

107
00:06:33,180 --&gt; 00:06:34,019
in the Jewish context.

108
00:06:35,610 --&gt; 00:06:41,450
We have, also, with the return to the land
of Israel of Zionism, with the revival of

109
00:06:41,450 --&gt; 00:06:44,690
the Jewish people through Zionism, we have
a

110
00:06:44,690 --&gt; 00:06:48,130
very strong focus on the psyche of the
nation.

111
00:06:48,130 --&gt; 00:06:50,360
Not on the small social group, less on the

112
00:06:50,360 --&gt; 00:06:53,440
individual to some extent, but more on the
nation.

113
00:06:53,440 --&gt; 00:06:58,620
And Rabbi Kook Is one of the people who
give a mystical, religious rational

114
00:06:58,620 --&gt; 00:07:00,410
to Zionism.

115
00:07:00,410 --&gt; 00:07:04,790
Now this is not to say, in a simplistic
manner, that Rabbi Kook, was a Zionist.

116
00:07:06,270 --&gt; 00:07:09,690
Rabbi Kook was a, was somebody who was
somewhat critical

117
00:07:09,690 --&gt; 00:07:14,080
of Zionism, as a secular movement, as a
largely secular movement.

118
00:07:14,080 --&gt; 00:07:16,730
However, was even critical of religious
Zionism.

119
00:07:16,730 --&gt; 00:07:23,720
What was called the Mizuchi party, founded
in 1903, for, I would say, selling out

120
00:07:23,720 --&gt; 00:07:26,430
somewhat, to the secular ethos of Zionism.

121
00:07:26,430 --&gt; 00:07:28,240
And even he tried to establish his own
movement, but

122
00:07:28,240 --&gt; 00:07:30,760
he wasn't a very good politician so that
didn't work.

123
00:07:30,760 --&gt; 00:07:33,150
However Rabbi Kook, despite being critical
of

124
00:07:33,150 --&gt; 00:07:37,780
Zionism, also saw the positive aspects of
Zionism.

125
00:07:37,780 --&gt; 00:07:42,550
And one of these positive aspects that he
sees is the revival not only of the Jewish

126
00:07:42,550 --&gt; 00:07:48,920
body through moving out of a sort of more
to put it strongly, ghetto mentality,

127
00:07:48,920 --&gt; 00:07:52,790
of being bent over and living in fear and
so on to, this

128
00:07:52,790 --&gt; 00:07:57,780
is a very nationalist ethos, to being
muscular and walking around in the sun.

129
00:07:57,780 --&gt; 00:07:59,200
Which is, and that is pretty intense.

130
00:08:00,480 --&gt; 00:08:07,050
The vigor of youth and so on and so forth,
not only for body, but also a change

131
00:08:07,050 --&gt; 00:08:09,730
in the psychic, a change from a cultural
fear

132
00:08:09,730 --&gt; 00:08:13,380
of persecution to a culture of
independence, of self confidence.

133
00:08:13,380 --&gt; 00:08:15,540
And rabbi Kook Despite

134
00:08:15,540 --&gt; 00:08:20,030
the fact that these developments were
connected also to a certain

135
00:08:20,030 --&gt; 00:08:24,700
autonomy from religious authority, Rabbi
Kook saw these as positive developments.

136
00:08:24,700 --&gt; 00:08:26,910
He saw these as positive developments from
a religious

137
00:08:26,910 --&gt; 00:08:29,510
point of view, from a mystical point of
view.

138
00:08:29,510 --&gt; 00:08:35,720
And he developed an entire national
psychology that explains the place of

139
00:08:35,720 --&gt; 00:08:40,810
The revival of the Jewish nation [UNKNOWN]
scheme, the revival of a Jewish

140
00:08:40,810 --&gt; 00:08:44,660
body, the revival of a Jewish psyche for
national psyche.

141
00:08:44,660 --&gt; 00:08:47,310
Now, the soul for Rabbi Kook is perhaps

142
00:08:47,310 --&gt; 00:08:52,710
for most important concept or theme and
for

143
00:08:52,710 --&gt; 00:08:54,740
him the focus is on the national soul

144
00:08:54,740 --&gt; 00:08:57,650
not on the individual soul, on the
national soul.

145
00:08:57,650 --&gt; 00:09:01,590
Not in the history of reincarnations of
individuals souls almost doesn't

146
00:09:01,590 --&gt; 00:09:03,890
concern him with maybe one or two places
with hints of it.

147
00:09:06,010 --&gt; 00:09:10,210
But more of a soul of a nation that is now
revived and is

148
00:09:10,210 --&gt; 00:09:15,020
now given this kind of rebirth in its
ancestual homeland in the land of Israel.

149
00:09:16,360 --&gt; 00:09:16,740
Now.

150
00:09:16,740 --&gt; 00:09:17,710
.

151
00:09:17,710 --&gt; 00:09:20,280
Before concluding this preliminary
discussion of Rabbi Kook, I

152
00:09:20,280 --&gt; 00:09:23,300
want to point out that the, one has to

153
00:09:23,300 --&gt; 00:09:25,640
look at two phases in Rabbi Kook's
development, one

154
00:09:25,640 --&gt; 00:09:29,500
more in the 19th Century, and one
characteristically 20th Century.

155
00:09:30,590 --&gt; 00:09:31,570
In the,

156
00:09:31,570 --&gt; 00:09:36,810
before 1904, in the first four decades of
his life Rabbi Kook lives in the

157
00:09:38,030 --&gt; 00:09:43,350
Baltic states, one could say, Latvia of
today, Lithuanian culture in Jewish terms.

158
00:09:43,350 --&gt; 00:09:47,060
And he absorbs the ethos of the Lithuanian
Jewish world, of

159
00:09:47,060 --&gt; 00:09:52,310
the school of Rabbi Kramer of Vilna, and
especially responds positively.

160
00:09:52,310 --&gt; 00:09:54,280
To the movement that we spoke about,

161
00:09:54,280 --&gt; 00:09:57,057
the Mussar movement, the movement of
self-cultivation,

162
00:09:57,057 --&gt; 00:10:01,370
of ethical self-development.
And he has guidance in this Shannah.

163
00:10:01,370 --&gt; 00:10:02,340
There's a forthcoming book.

164
00:10:02,340 --&gt; 00:10:04,750
It's Yale by Yehudah Mirsky.

165
00:10:04,750 --&gt; 00:10:07,779
It's Mirsky, who is going to go into this
at, at length.

166
00:10:08,840 --&gt; 00:10:11,530
However, in 1904 as it mostly points out
there

167
00:10:11,530 --&gt; 00:10:15,090
is a shift, he arrives in Jaffa, in
Palestine

168
00:10:15,090 --&gt; 00:10:18,400
of [UNKNOWN] Palestine, later to become
British Palestine, later

169
00:10:18,400 --&gt; 00:10:22,160
to become Israel and he develops much more
national

170
00:10:22,160 --&gt; 00:10:25,380
way of thinking focused on the land of
Israel, focused on

171
00:10:25,380 --&gt; 00:10:28,750
the people of Israel, and sees a big shift
in his thought.

172
00:10:28,750 --&gt; 00:10:29,460
Around this period.

173
00:10:29,460 --&gt; 00:10:33,030
And this continues to develop, to
intensify.

174
00:10:33,030 --&gt; 00:10:37,240
Paradoxically in a few years during the
first world war.

175
00:10:37,240 --&gt; 00:10:40,180
He lives abroad in Switzerland and
England.

176
00:10:40,180 --&gt; 00:10:42,950
He, out of his yearning for the Land of
Israel, he,

177
00:10:42,950 --&gt; 00:10:47,630
and also in this relative peace and quiet
that he has Out

178
00:10:47,630 --&gt; 00:10:51,950
of his usual duties, he develops his
thought to match more intensely

179
00:10:51,950 --&gt; 00:10:56,110
an essential book of national psychology
of a book of lights, orots.

180
00:10:56,110 --&gt; 00:10:59,020
There's a lot of lights in Kabbalistic
titles, especially

181
00:10:59,020 --&gt; 00:11:02,490
Rabbi Kook's book, is largely written in
this period.

182
00:11:02,490 --&gt; 00:11:04,620
And also in response to a first world war.

183
00:11:04,620 --&gt; 00:11:06,980
Now, when we think about a first world

184
00:11:06,980 --&gt; 00:11:09,170
war or [UNKNOWN] to remember that people
experiencing

185
00:11:09,170 --&gt; 00:11:12,760
a first world war at the beginning of the
20th century do not know that it's

186
00:11:12,760 --&gt; 00:11:13,690
only the first world war.

187
00:11:14,730 --&gt; 00:11:20,940
Fortunately for them perhaps and there's
massive catastrophe and Seismic

188
00:11:20,940 --&gt; 00:11:25,460
change in the whole structure, the whole,
literally the map of Europe, and society.

189
00:11:25,460 --&gt; 00:11:27,740
If one wants to see a bit of a, a, a, a

190
00:11:27,740 --&gt; 00:11:29,240
cinematic portrayal, one can look at

191
00:11:29,240 --&gt; 00:11:31,460
Downton Abbey and see how that's
portrayed.

192
00:11:31,460 --&gt; 00:11:34,400
The, so the first world war is a big
crisis.

193
00:11:34,400 --&gt; 00:11:37,930
But for Rabbi Kook, crisis, and this is
connected to the point I'll mention

194
00:11:37,930 --&gt; 00:11:41,890
soon of positive psychology, Crisis is
always opportunity.

195
00:11:41,890 --&gt; 00:11:43,930
And the First World War almost ended with

196
00:11:43,930 --&gt; 00:11:46,210
the Balfour Declaration on the Jewish
national home

197
00:11:46,210 --&gt; 00:11:49,720
in Palestine from the British Government,
paving the

198
00:11:49,720 --&gt; 00:11:52,000
way to the establishment of the State of
Israel.

199
00:11:52,000 --&gt; 00:11:54,450
He saw all this as a Messianic awakening,
as a

200
00:11:54,450 --&gt; 00:11:57,520
cosmic event, not just as a political
event Of all the

201
00:11:57,520 --&gt; 00:12:01,340
suffering of the war as an opportunity for
awakening, our opportunity

202
00:12:01,340 --&gt; 00:12:03,280
of this change in the map of Europe, of
the world.

203
00:12:03,280 --&gt; 00:12:07,625
This new sense of, of a world, of a world
war is an opportunity for

204
00:12:07,625 --&gt; 00:12:10,390
this change, which is not only political

205
00:12:10,390 --&gt; 00:12:14,350
for him but spiritual, mystical and also
psychological.
