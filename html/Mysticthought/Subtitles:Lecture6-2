1
00:00:00,120 --&gt; 00:00:02,670
Now I want to speak about Bohme
psychology.

2
00:00:02,670 --&gt; 00:00:04,260
and first of all to stress, and this is

3
00:00:04,260 --&gt; 00:00:06,530
again part of the not exactly German
because he was

4
00:00:06,530 --&gt; 00:00:08,550
Swiss Jung, but Karl Jung is part of the

5
00:00:08,550 --&gt; 00:00:12,110
German speak in psychological tradition,
and Jung also had issues

6
00:00:12,110 --&gt; 00:00:14,570
with his relationship to Nazism, which I
won't go

7
00:00:14,570 --&gt; 00:00:19,240
into here, but Jung also was influenced by
Bohme and

8
00:00:19,240 --&gt; 00:00:21,220
if one really looks into his works one can
see

9
00:00:21,220 --&gt; 00:00:23,479
that this influence is stronger than
people might have thought.

10
00:00:24,590 --&gt; 00:00:25,460
Now,

11
00:00:25,460 --&gt; 00:00:28,520
what Hume took from him is that these
various ideas.

12
00:00:28,520 --&gt; 00:00:30,710
One is the union of opposites.

13
00:00:30,710 --&gt; 00:00:32,090
The idea that you take conflicting

14
00:00:32,090 --&gt; 00:00:35,550
forces, a dialectical opposition between
conflicting

15
00:00:35,550 --&gt; 00:00:41,190
forces, a strong theme in German
philosophy like Hegel, and you unify them.

16
00:00:41,190 --&gt; 00:00:45,720
And through the unification of forces -
You develop a very strong core of self.

17
00:00:45,720 --&gt; 00:00:51,260
A self that is able to contain, and to
bring together contradictory forces.

18
00:00:51,260 --&gt; 00:00:53,220
So this is, these are two ideas that Jung
took.

19
00:00:53,220 --&gt; 00:00:56,410
The idea of a strong center of self, which
we've already encountered.

20
00:00:56,410 --&gt; 00:00:58,980
The idea of unifying opposites.

21
00:00:58,980 --&gt; 00:01:01,040
That, perhaps we've spoken about this
less.

22
00:01:01,040 --&gt; 00:01:03,720
But, it's certainly found in [UNKNOWN].

23
00:01:03,720 --&gt; 00:01:10,530
And, now Jung also speaks about the idea
of finding one's true personality.

24
00:01:10,530 --&gt; 00:01:13,270
That is a, outward personality and

25
00:01:13,270 --&gt; 00:01:17,200
an inward personality that through this
integration

26
00:01:17,200 --&gt; 00:01:19,770
of various forces one discovers.

27
00:01:19,770 --&gt; 00:01:23,790
Now I want to take a much more conflictual
approach because what Jung is speaking

28
00:01:23,790 --&gt; 00:01:26,350
about is what we'd call it, humanistic

29
00:01:26,350 --&gt; 00:01:29,660
psychology of how the different forces
come together.

30
00:01:29,660 --&gt; 00:01:31,290
And I want to speak about a more

31
00:01:31,290 --&gt; 00:01:34,880
conflictual, agonistic psychology which
with some more antagonism

32
00:01:34,880 --&gt; 00:01:38,830
going on, and very much, I think it will
make things more vivid, far more vivid.

33
00:01:39,960 --&gt; 00:01:41,940
So he go,

34
00:01:41,940 --&gt; 00:01:45,370
Bohme, so he speaks about the inner
psychology

35
00:01:45,370 --&gt; 00:01:47,040
of God, which is very radical to speak

36
00:01:47,040 --&gt; 00:01:49,160
about God as having a psychology which is

37
00:01:49,160 --&gt; 00:01:52,400
not something which is spoken about
enough, until now.

38
00:01:52,400 --&gt; 00:01:56,080
God has various psychic forces which
include forces

39
00:01:56,080 --&gt; 00:01:58,770
that we would see as negative such as
anger.

40
00:01:58,770 --&gt; 00:02:04,710
Such as anguish, God has pain as anguish
and, yes what is creation about?

41
00:02:04,710 --&gt; 00:02:07,420
Creation is God's own therapy.
When

42
00:02:07,420 --&gt; 00:02:10,360
God through a creative work, the idea of
through some

43
00:02:10,360 --&gt; 00:02:14,570
kind of play, creative play or work, a
psychoanalytic idea.

44
00:02:14,570 --&gt; 00:02:19,350
God explores his own psyche, explores his
own psychic forces.

45
00:02:19,350 --&gt; 00:02:23,140
Contends with various contradictions
inside himself or

46
00:02:23,140 --&gt; 00:02:25,900
herself, soon we'll speak about the gender
aspect.

47
00:02:25,900 --&gt; 00:02:30,210
Now, this is very interesting because
there are parallels

48
00:02:30,210 --&gt; 00:02:32,640
to [UNKNOWN] where [UNKNOWN], who we spoke
about, speaks about

49
00:02:32,640 --&gt; 00:02:33,900
God's evil impulse.

50
00:02:33,900 --&gt; 00:02:37,460
God has evil impulses, it's [UNKNOWN], and
he has to overcome it.

51
00:02:38,850 --&gt; 00:02:43,100
Now Bohme says, the very desire to create,
to

52
00:02:43,100 --&gt; 00:02:47,440
create a new desire, this desire creates
darkness, just like

53
00:02:47,440 --&gt; 00:02:51,190
a Buddhist analysis of desire in Buddhist
psychology [INAUDIBLE],

54
00:02:51,190 --&gt; 00:02:54,430
that, because when you desire something
you focus on it.

55
00:02:54,430 --&gt; 00:02:57,720
So you, this is very cabalistic, you
contract.

56
00:02:57,720 --&gt; 00:03:01,280
You contract your intention onto a certain
thing that you desire.

57
00:03:01,280 --&gt; 00:03:06,610
When you want to make something, so just
like God in the Genesis accounts separates

58
00:03:06,610 --&gt; 00:03:11,770
between the upper, the lower, land, water,
you create boundaries.

59
00:03:11,770 --&gt; 00:03:13,840
You concentrate on certain things.

60
00:03:13,840 --&gt; 00:03:17,990
The land emerges in a concentrated way
from the water, et cetera.

61
00:03:17,990 --&gt; 00:03:20,930
Now this process of concentration creates
pressure.

62
00:03:22,140 --&gt; 00:03:23,230
There's an intensity

63
00:03:23,230 --&gt; 00:03:28,480
here and it creates attachment like in a
Buddhist analysis

64
00:03:28,480 --&gt; 00:03:31,780
because you desiring to create something
so this is a hunger.

65
00:03:31,780 --&gt; 00:03:33,810
There's a psychic hunger here and this is
like

66
00:03:33,810 --&gt; 00:03:37,320
psychological analysis of the first
moments of life Cause think

67
00:03:37,320 --&gt; 00:03:39,030
of it a moment that the first months of
life

68
00:03:39,030 --&gt; 00:03:44,900
in psychoanalysis correspond to the
Genesis account, in the Bible.

69
00:03:44,900 --&gt; 00:03:48,340
Now, this tension creates as I said
anguish,

70
00:03:48,340 --&gt; 00:03:53,010
anxiety, agitation and here I want to
speak about a psychoanalyst who

71
00:03:53,010 --&gt; 00:03:56,830
comes from the same tradition that speaks
about the first months of life.

72
00:03:56,830 --&gt; 00:04:00,950
Because Freud spoke about later phases in
life, and the great innovation of Melanie

73
00:04:00,950 --&gt; 00:04:06,590
Klein in around the mid 20th century to
speak about the first months of life.

74
00:04:06,590 --&gt; 00:04:10,400
And one of the major students, Betty
Joseph, speaks about psychic pain.

75
00:04:10,400 --&gt; 00:04:14,330
It's part of this process.
When it developed in these first months.

76
00:04:14,330 --&gt; 00:04:16,320
And I think Bohme is speaking about
psychic pain.

77
00:04:17,440 --&gt; 00:04:22,240
And the creative process is again let's
use a psychoanalytic term, the working

78
00:04:22,240 --&gt; 00:04:27,030
through of this anguish of the psychic
pain of the attachment of desire

79
00:04:28,240 --&gt; 00:04:33,220
of the pressures that are part of the
creative process.

80
00:04:34,360 --&gt; 00:04:36,830
And now this is a God who has emotions.

81
00:04:36,830 --&gt; 00:04:39,500
Strong emotional life.
And this is what

82
00:04:39,500 --&gt; 00:04:45,210
researchers called Anthropo-pathic, not
Anthropo- morphic that is the more fair,

83
00:04:45,210 --&gt; 00:04:47,650
the form of God that we speak of God in
bodily

84
00:04:47,650 --&gt; 00:04:50,420
terms, about the limbs of God and so on,
which happens

85
00:04:50,420 --&gt; 00:04:54,370
in Kabbalah, but we're speaking about the
pathos, the emotions of God.

86
00:04:54,370 --&gt; 00:04:58,430
And Bohme certainly an anthropomorphic
thinker in the sense

87
00:04:58,430 --&gt; 00:05:03,853
of speaking about God's emotional inner
life, psychological life.

88
00:05:03,853 --&gt; 00:05:04,581
And this is

89
00:05:04,581 --&gt; 00:05:07,200
something which Kabbalah research is
working on now.

90
00:05:07,200 --&gt; 00:05:08,910
Daniel Abrams and others.

91
00:05:08,910 --&gt; 00:05:11,350
And I want to bring this into the
discussion to show how a

92
00:05:11,350 --&gt; 00:05:14,460
thinker influenced by Kabbalah, by
Kabbalistic accounts

93
00:05:14,460 --&gt; 00:05:17,670
of the creation, Brings the psychological
dimension.

94
00:05:17,670 --&gt; 00:05:19,300
Into his own description of the creation.
