00:00:00,570 --&gt; 00:00:03,080
So, when moving to the east and to the
west, from the east

2
00:00:03,080 --&gt; 00:00:06,398
to the west in Europe there's a few things
one has to remember.

3
00:00:06,398 --&gt; 00:00:12,640
One is that we're moving to areas which
have been far better researched.

4
00:00:12,640 --&gt; 00:00:14,260
Now it's not as if there isn't research

5
00:00:14,260 --&gt; 00:00:16,720
on the Orthodox mystical world and
Hesychasm, there

6
00:00:16,720 --&gt; 00:00:18,840
is, but you can't compare it to what

7
00:00:18,840 --&gt; 00:00:21,570
there is in the Catholic and the
Protestant world.

8
00:00:21,570 --&gt; 00:00:25,890
Because a lot of the material is written
in Russian or other

9
00:00:25,890 --&gt; 00:00:29,440
Eastern European languages and has not
been translated, so at least someone

10
00:00:29,440 --&gt; 00:00:33,420
like myself, unlike my teacher [INAUDIBLE]
in Romanian and Russian and so on.

11
00:00:33,420 --&gt; 00:00:35,850
But for somebody like myself, who works in

12
00:00:35,850 --&gt; 00:00:39,720
English or French, it's it's very hard to
to

13
00:00:39,720 --&gt; 00:00:41,600
get access, and I think generally the
material

14
00:00:41,600 --&gt; 00:00:44,520
is less available, it's less web based,
for instance.

15
00:00:44,520 --&gt; 00:00:48,930
It's less available in libraries, in, in,
at least in western Europe or America.

16
00:00:48,930 --&gt; 00:00:50,970
Now, one has to remember, of course,

17
00:00:50,970 --&gt; 00:00:53,000
that a lot of this was underground for
many years, so there

18
00:00:53,000 --&gt; 00:00:55,930
are gaps, which we don't have in the case
of the West.

19
00:00:55,930 --&gt; 00:01:00,440
The third thing to remember is that when
we speak in post-eighteenth century,

20
00:01:01,650 --&gt; 00:01:03,340
Jewish mysticism in Europe is a

21
00:01:03,340 --&gt; 00:01:06,840
largely Eastern-European, or at best,
Central-European phenomenon.

22
00:01:08,460 --&gt; 00:01:10,610
Even though the Jews returned to England
around

23
00:01:10,610 --&gt; 00:01:14,500
the time of Cromwell, we don't have
English mysticism.

24
00:01:14,500 --&gt; 00:01:15,970
The one is capitalist born

25
00:01:15,970 --&gt; 00:01:17,680
in England actually operating in
Jerusalem,

26
00:01:17,680 --&gt; 00:01:20,100
but we don't have English Kabbalah.

27
00:01:20,100 --&gt; 00:01:22,250
We don't have so much, very little in
France.

28
00:01:23,646 --&gt; 00:01:28,200
Italy after the Lutzato circle was
supressed, we don't have much Kabbalah;

29
00:01:28,200 --&gt; 00:01:32,570
there is a bit Eliyahu ben Mozeg, an
important figure, but very little.

30
00:01:34,360 --&gt; 00:01:38,910
Even in Germany, in 18th century, early
19th century, we still have Kabbalists.

31
00:01:38,910 --&gt; 00:01:41,840
There is still one Kabbalist in 19th
century.

32
00:01:41,840 --&gt; 00:01:44,880
Generally, German Jewry moved away from
the Kabbalistic direction.

33
00:01:46,030 --&gt; 00:01:48,531
Central Europe, Prague, again the height
of it

34
00:01:48,531 --&gt; 00:01:51,230
is the 17th century, it becomes weaker
later on.

35
00:01:52,380 --&gt; 00:01:56,040
So, we speaking about, when we move to the
West, we speaking

36
00:01:56,040 --&gt; 00:02:00,830
about areas in which Kabalistic world was
more present in earlier periods.

37
00:02:00,830 --&gt; 00:02:04,010
So, if we speaking about 19th, 20th,

38
00:02:04,010 --&gt; 00:02:06,960
19th, 20th century we won't find these
parallels.

39
00:02:06,960 --&gt; 00:02:09,800
But what will be interesting is that when
we

40
00:02:09,800 --&gt; 00:02:12,030
move on to the west in the next couple of,

41
00:02:12,030 --&gt; 00:02:16,310
of classes, we will find subtle parallels
to Kabbalah,

42
00:02:16,310 --&gt; 00:02:18,160
but they'll be more subtle than what we
saw today.

43
00:02:18,160 --&gt; 00:02:19,480
Here, today it was more obvious.

44
00:02:20,810 --&gt; 00:02:26,620
Now, one thing to bear in mind also, one
last thing to bear in mind,

45
00:02:26,620 --&gt; 00:02:30,190
is the commonality, that despite what I
spoke

46
00:02:30,190 --&gt; 00:02:32,400
about, the great schism between the
Eastern and

47
00:02:32,400 --&gt; 00:02:33,870
Western church.

48
00:02:33,870 --&gt; 00:02:37,450
And schism which is beginning to be
bridged, especially after the Vatican Two

49
00:02:37,450 --&gt; 00:02:42,660
convention that is more the spirit of
Ekumenizam today between East and West.

50
00:02:42,660 --&gt; 00:02:44,660
But, we alway divide between east and

51
00:02:44,660 --&gt; 00:02:46,360
west, which in a way, I've been
emphasizing.

52
00:02:46,360 --&gt; 00:02:50,400
There are commonalities.
And one commonality that I want us to pay

53
00:02:50,400 --&gt; 00:02:57,420
attention to is that of passivity, the
idea of being dependent on the grace

54
00:02:57,420 --&gt; 00:02:58,360
of God.

55
00:02:58,360 --&gt; 00:03:02,580
There is a huge debate in the Christian
tradition between grace and works.

56
00:03:02,580 --&gt; 00:03:05,430
And in a way, inside the whole, a lot

57
00:03:05,430 --&gt; 00:03:08,910
of the debates under the Protestant
Revolution around this question

58
00:03:08,910 --&gt; 00:03:11,330
of whether it's our self effort, whether
one needs

59
00:03:11,330 --&gt; 00:03:13,890
the church, whether it's the grace of God
et cetera.

60
00:03:15,600 --&gt; 00:03:19,470
In mysticism, European mysticism, modern
European mysticism,

61
00:03:19,470 --&gt; 00:03:23,220
Hasidism, and in Hesychasm and in Quietism

62
00:03:23,220 --&gt; 00:03:26,410
that we'll be speaking about in the next
class or two.

63
00:03:26,410 --&gt; 00:03:31,290
There is a strong emphasis on being
passive, on letting God do the work.

64
00:03:31,290 --&gt; 00:03:34,890
And I think this is one strong commonality
to pay attention to.

65
00:03:34,890 --&gt; 00:03:36,670
Besides the obvious, of the focus on the
inner

66
00:03:36,670 --&gt; 00:03:38,590
world et cetera, on the heart and the
soul.

67
00:03:38,590 --&gt; 00:03:41,100
The, that's, the religion of the heart
that Kempler wrote about,

68
00:03:41,100 --&gt; 00:03:44,120
that is both in the East and in West and
in Judaism.

69
00:03:44,120 --&gt; 00:03:46,500
But, if there's one thing which is a

70
00:03:46,500 --&gt; 00:03:48,600
common theme of all the differences that
we're beginning

71
00:03:48,600 --&gt; 00:03:49,630
to notice.

72
00:03:49,630 --&gt; 00:03:53,284
It's this idea of facility, which is
again, is so different from the idea

73
00:03:53,284 --&gt; 00:03:57,043
of a self made person, of self help, and
of positive psychology of today.

74
00:03:57,043 --&gt; 00:04:00,420
