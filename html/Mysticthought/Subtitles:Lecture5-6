1
00:00:00,570 --&gt; 00:00:02,990
Now I want to speak about one more issue
in the Spiritual Guidebook,

2
00:00:02,990 --&gt; 00:00:05,770
which is really a very powerful book, and
it's really worth looking at.

3
00:00:07,110 --&gt; 00:00:08,710
There's a seeming contradiction here, and

4
00:00:08,710 --&gt; 00:00:10,690
of course for scholars of religion,
seeming

5
00:00:10,690 --&gt; 00:00:12,930
contradictions are very good because it
takes

6
00:00:12,930 --&gt; 00:00:15,220
one to a different level of discussion.

7
00:00:15,220 --&gt; 00:00:17,380
We see the complexity of religious fault,
it's

8
00:00:17,380 --&gt; 00:00:20,690
not all simplistic about being quiet in
self.

9
00:00:20,690 --&gt; 00:00:24,680
He speaks a lot about the importance of
the communion, the mass, the Eucharist.

10
00:00:24,680 --&gt; 00:00:25,410
ingesting,

11
00:00:25,410 --&gt; 00:00:29,240
the, the wafer, ingesting, the, really
the, the flesh and blood of Christ.

12
00:00:29,240 --&gt; 00:00:31,320
Which is a very central Catholic ceremony,
but a lot

13
00:00:31,320 --&gt; 00:00:34,170
mystics speak about, all the way into the
20th century.

14
00:00:34,170 --&gt; 00:00:37,150
Thomas Martin, that I'll speak about
maybe, has a book about this.

15
00:00:38,350 --&gt; 00:00:41,270
Now, he says how important it is.

16
00:00:41,270 --&gt; 00:00:43,400
But similarly this contradicts everything
he says.

17
00:00:43,400 --&gt; 00:00:46,310
He says one doesn't, shouldn't do things,
one should let go of

18
00:00:46,310 --&gt; 00:00:49,900
doing, let go of verbal prayer, just be
quiet in the soul.

19
00:00:49,900 --&gt; 00:00:50,563
Why does he need

20
00:00:50,563 --&gt; 00:00:53,980
this ceremony for?
But actually, there's no contradiction.

21
00:00:53,980 --&gt; 00:00:56,810
Because the whole idea of mass, is that of
passively

22
00:00:56,810 --&gt; 00:01:01,550
taking in Christ into one's body, ingested
at the term.

23
00:01:01,550 --&gt; 00:01:04,210
So one, it's, it's a doing which is a form
of non-doing, really.

24
00:01:05,220 --&gt; 00:01:08,410
And he says, in order to take the
communion, in order to be in the

25
00:01:08,410 --&gt; 00:01:10,390
proper spiritual state, there's a lot of
discussion

26
00:01:10,390 --&gt; 00:01:11,920
of what state you have to be in.

27
00:01:11,920 --&gt; 00:01:15,050
It's not about external rights, which you
have to confess and so on.

28
00:01:15,050 --&gt; 00:01:15,650
One has to be

29
00:01:15,650 --&gt; 00:01:17,040
in an internal state.

30
00:01:17,040 --&gt; 00:01:20,360
One has to get to the very depth, again,
depth, of nothing.

31
00:01:21,370 --&gt; 00:01:22,830
One has to empty out to receive it.

32
00:01:22,830 --&gt; 00:01:26,010
You empty yourself, and then all that
comes in is the body of Christ.

33
00:01:27,160 --&gt; 00:01:29,935
And one it, it says one place you have to
get to total nakedness.

34
00:01:29,935 --&gt; 00:01:30,870
That's a very strong phrase.

35
00:01:32,280 --&gt; 00:01:34,660
And he says actually all the suffering and
the torment that you go through

36
00:01:34,660 --&gt; 00:01:38,750
on the way, that are sort of skipped over,
helps you to empty out.

37
00:01:38,750 --&gt; 00:01:40,810
because it sort of gets rid of all kind of
things and

38
00:01:40,810 --&gt; 00:01:41,770
cleans out the system.

39
00:01:43,010 --&gt; 00:01:45,100
And he says, clothe yourself of this
nothing.

40
00:01:45,100 --&gt; 00:01:47,920
You have to really embrace this
nothingness.

41
00:01:47,920 --&gt; 00:01:49,920
And then he says, you can lose yourself in
God.

42
00:01:49,920 --&gt; 00:01:53,090
Again, through this rite or in other ways,
you lose yourself in God.

43
00:01:53,090 --&gt; 00:01:55,920
And he says at this point, you take a nap
in nothing.

44
00:01:55,920 --&gt; 00:01:57,500
This is a very deep form of trance.

45
00:01:57,500 --&gt; 00:01:59,870
That you just, all mental activity ceases.

46
00:01:59,870 --&gt; 00:02:04,310
Just go in, into a state of shutting down
the whole system really.

47
00:02:05,330 --&gt; 00:02:06,440
And hypnotic

48
00:02:06,440 --&gt; 00:02:10,050
literature, people like Rossi, the student
of the great Milton Erickson, and

49
00:02:10,050 --&gt; 00:02:14,850
so on, one of the great hypnotists of our
time that I've mentioned.

50
00:02:14,850 --&gt; 00:02:16,810
We speak about this, that you can really
take, he's

51
00:02:16,810 --&gt; 00:02:18,820
speak, he's got this book about this, the
20 minute nap

52
00:02:18,820 --&gt; 00:02:20,745
or something that you can take a 20 minute
break,

53
00:02:20,745 --&gt; 00:02:23,950
close down the whole system, and then the
whole system restarts.

54
00:02:23,950 --&gt; 00:02:25,140
Just like a computer, when it gives you

55
00:02:25,140 --&gt; 00:02:27,050
trouble, the simplest thing is just to
restart,

56
00:02:27,050 --&gt; 00:02:31,150
and it sort of wakes itself up again, and
gets rid of whatever bug it was.

57
00:02:31,150 --&gt; 00:02:35,540
So now, there's lots of parallels here
which we'll soon, will soon

58
00:02:35,540 --&gt; 00:02:40,148
emerge to Hasidic faults, because this
idea of nothingness, of A'yin, it's

59
00:02:40,148 --&gt; 00:02:44,300
A, A with apostrophe, Y, I, N, is a very
central term

60
00:02:44,300 --&gt; 00:02:47,420
for the Hasidism, that you have to get to
the state of nothingness.

61
00:02:47,420 --&gt; 00:02:50,590
From the very beginnings of Hasidism, they
speak about this.

62
00:02:50,590 --&gt; 00:02:56,240
Now, now, he, he speaks about a very idea
which is very similar to Hasidism.

63
00:02:56,240 --&gt; 00:02:59,260
You have to get to annihilation.
But of a city called Vitul.

64
00:02:59,260 --&gt; 00:03:00,750
V I T U L.

65
00:03:00,750 --&gt; 00:03:03,390
You have to annihilate your orderly
consciousness.

66
00:03:03,390 --&gt; 00:03:07,461
It sounds very aggressive, and it is a
form of spiritual warfare, and

67
00:03:07,461 --&gt; 00:03:12,230
there's a lot of torment involved, but as
we've said, it's a stage.

68
00:03:12,230 --&gt; 00:03:14,251
And, uses very similar language to the
Hasidism,

69
00:03:14,251 --&gt; 00:03:16,660
[UNKNOWN] you become like a drop in the
ocean.

70
00:03:16,660 --&gt; 00:03:18,630
You get to what's called oceanic
consciousness,

71
00:03:18,630 --&gt; 00:03:20,900
we'll speak about this more in a minute.

72
00:03:20,900 --&gt; 00:03:21,220
He says,

73
00:03:21,220 --&gt; 00:03:25,110
you go to the bottom of a soul, and the
bottom of a soul is like immense ocean.

74
00:03:25,110 --&gt; 00:03:26,720
So you imagine get into the very bottom of

75
00:03:26,720 --&gt; 00:03:29,000
a huge, like the Pacific Ocean, a very
deep ocean.

76
00:03:30,140 --&gt; 00:03:33,560
Now, this is what Freud called Oceanic
Feeling.

77
00:03:33,560 --&gt; 00:03:37,760
And William Parsons, who have mentioned
already, eh,latest book, he speaks

78
00:03:37,760 --&gt; 00:03:41,750
about this whole correspondence for it had
a ground the oceanic feeling.

79
00:03:41,750 --&gt; 00:03:43,140
He didn't quite get it, he didn't quite

80
00:03:43,140 --&gt; 00:03:44,800
understand it, but he thought that it was
important.

81
00:03:44,800 --&gt; 00:03:46,900
It is a very deep unconscious state

82
00:03:46,900 --&gt; 00:03:50,610
in which one loses one's separate identity
and becomes immersed in this

83
00:03:50,610 --&gt; 00:03:55,800
kind of oce, oceanic, very deep, very
boundless consciousness, which from the

84
00:03:55,800 --&gt; 00:03:57,890
point of view of the ego of the surface
mind is actually

85
00:03:57,890 --&gt; 00:04:01,280
nothing because the, the surface mind has
nothing to hang on to there.

86
00:04:01,280 --&gt; 00:04:03,750
But from a point of view of inner world is
actually probably very rich.

87
00:04:03,750 --&gt; 00:04:05,530
Because he speaks about the sweetness and
so on.

88
00:04:07,080 --&gt; 00:04:09,310
And then he uses another set of images
which the

89
00:04:09,310 --&gt; 00:04:12,300
Hasidim also very much like, I've got a
whole discussion

90
00:04:12,300 --&gt; 00:04:15,400
of this in my shamanic charms book, of
fire imagery.

91
00:04:15,400 --&gt; 00:04:17,570
It says you have to become burnt and
transformed.

92
00:04:17,570 --&gt; 00:04:21,360
It's like fire is something which can burn
something and reshape it.

93
00:04:21,360 --&gt; 00:04:23,090
He says you have to become like the
salamanders,

94
00:04:23,090 --&gt; 00:04:26,120
like a classical, mythical imagery of this
mythical beast that

95
00:04:26,120 --&gt; 00:04:28,700
sort of gets consumed by fire and reborn,
a bit

96
00:04:28,700 --&gt; 00:04:32,030
like a phoenix that I mentioned, a la
Harry Potter.

97
00:04:32,030 --&gt; 00:04:34,310
And, speaking of Harry Potter, the
salamander is actually

98
00:04:34,310 --&gt; 00:04:37,570
deployed in a very strategic place in the
Narnia series

99
00:04:37,570 --&gt; 00:04:42,110
by C.S. Lewis as important 20th Century
Christian writer.

100
00:04:42,110 --&gt; 00:04:46,210
And I could, I don't want to again have
too many book titles,

101
00:04:46,210 --&gt; 00:04:48,920
but or, or, figures, but one, scholarly

102
00:04:48,920 --&gt; 00:04:50,250
figures, but one should really read
Michael

103
00:04:50,250 --&gt; 00:04:53,250
Ward on the Narnia books, because he's,
there's a lot going on there,

104
00:04:53,250 --&gt; 00:04:57,140
which we'll never notice when one's a
child, one's reading it as a child.

105
00:04:57,140 --&gt; 00:05:03,420
Now, or with one's children.
Now the last thing I want to say about

106
00:05:03,420 --&gt; 00:05:06,370
this book is that the, this guide book of

107
00:05:06,370 --&gt; 00:05:09,770
disentangling the soul, is a, is
antinomian in flavor here.

108
00:05:09,770 --&gt; 00:05:12,360
It's not as strong as things that we've
seen, but he does

109
00:05:12,360 --&gt; 00:05:15,840
say that you have to abolish the
distinction between means and end.

110
00:05:15,840 --&gt; 00:05:19,400
Remember what we said about prayer, that
you got

111
00:05:19,400 --&gt; 00:05:21,170
all these things to get the presence of a
kin.

112
00:05:21,170 --&gt; 00:05:24,700
But once you get a presence to the kin,
you don't need all this stuff.

113
00:05:24,700 --&gt; 00:05:29,130
So he says ultimately you lose this whole
sense that you've got means

114
00:05:29,130 --&gt; 00:05:30,390
towards an end, that you do all these

115
00:05:30,390 --&gt; 00:05:32,700
practices that lead to somewhere, because
at this

116
00:05:32,700 --&gt; 00:05:35,880
deeper state you already at the end all
the time in the bottom of a ocean.
