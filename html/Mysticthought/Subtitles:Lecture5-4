00:00:00,390 --&gt; 00:00:03,300
When we're speaking about Spain I want to
speak about two figures,

2
00:00:03,300 --&gt; 00:00:07,470
one of which will also be a figure in the
reading from Hollenbeck.

3
00:00:07,470 --&gt; 00:00:13,430
That, one is Teresa of Avila, and the
other is Saint John

4
00:00:13,430 --&gt; 00:00:17,410
of the Cross, San Juan de la Cruz, both in
early modern Spain.

5
00:00:17,410 --&gt; 00:00:20,580
A bit later than the period we were just
speaking of.

6
00:00:20,580 --&gt; 00:00:23,350
Now, these are very formative books

7
00:00:23,350 --&gt; 00:00:25,610
for the whole Quietistic movement, and
generally

8
00:00:25,610 --&gt; 00:00:26,540
for modern mysticism.

9
00:00:27,660 --&gt; 00:00:29,420
I, by the way, I don't overload of too

10
00:00:29,420 --&gt; 00:00:33,490
many references, but there's a huge
multi-series project of Bernard

11
00:00:33,490 --&gt; 00:00:39,290
McGinn of Chicago University on the
development of Christian mysticism

12
00:00:39,290 --&gt; 00:00:42,450
which certainly is a general resource that
one can use.

13
00:00:42,450 --&gt; 00:00:42,950
Now

14
00:00:45,290 --&gt; 00:00:48,340
these two figures, we'll speak a bit about

15
00:00:48,340 --&gt; 00:00:51,830
the, the psychology, especially the book
The Dark Night

16
00:00:51,830 --&gt; 00:00:53,460
of the Soul, it's a real classic, one
should

17
00:00:53,460 --&gt; 00:00:56,250
really read it by San Juan de la Cruz.

18
00:00:56,250 --&gt; 00:00:59,130
I remember reading it when I was 16, and I
said, it blew me away.

19
00:00:59,130 --&gt; 00:01:01,063
It's a very good book for the lessons,

20
00:01:01,063 --&gt; 00:01:02,600
because, you know, the lessons go through
all kinds

21
00:01:02,600 --&gt; 00:01:05,220
of crises, and he speaks these crises that

22
00:01:05,220 --&gt; 00:01:08,450
one has to go through if one deserves
mystically.

23
00:01:08,450 --&gt; 00:01:10,800
And then, by the way, when I was reading
this,

24
00:01:10,800 --&gt; 00:01:14,020
like half a year later I noticed the
Hacedic text by the second

25
00:01:14,020 --&gt; 00:01:17,780
web of the second lead of Habab Lubabich
saying almost the same thing.

26
00:01:17,780 --&gt; 00:01:19,294
So it was very significant.

27
00:01:19,294 --&gt; 00:01:22,809
Now San Juan basically says that one has

28
00:01:22,809 --&gt; 00:01:27,295
to go through periods of dryness, of
desolation.

29
00:01:27,295 --&gt; 00:01:29,220
At the beginning mystical life, and this

30
00:01:29,220 --&gt; 00:01:31,915
is something which many practitioners
report, mystical

31
00:01:31,915 --&gt; 00:01:33,895
life is very exciting, one changes one's

32
00:01:33,895 --&gt; 00:01:36,233
perception, discovers a new world in a
way.

33
00:01:36,233 --&gt; 00:01:39,457
By the way, this is not long after the New
World was discovered

34
00:01:39,457 --&gt; 00:01:43,996
by Columbus, who may have been connected
to these conversal circles we spoke about.

35
00:01:45,780 --&gt; 00:01:48,760
So one discovers this new world, and then
after

36
00:01:48,760 --&gt; 00:01:50,790
a while it gets routinized, just like we
said.

37
00:01:50,790 --&gt; 00:01:52,470
Routinization of charisma.

38
00:01:52,470 --&gt; 00:01:55,350
And one has this period of dryness and
desolation.

39
00:01:55,350 --&gt; 00:01:56,110
And then what happens?

40
00:01:56,110 --&gt; 00:02:01,510
So, the then what happens is what Teresa
and San Juan speak about.

41
00:02:01,510 --&gt; 00:02:05,290
And this is what the quietists really
developed.

42
00:02:05,290 --&gt; 00:02:08,500
Now, it's interesting also, of course the
importance

43
00:02:08,500 --&gt; 00:02:09,910
of a woman mystic here and of course

44
00:02:09,910 --&gt; 00:02:11,670
we'll be speaking about the Christian
context we'll

45
00:02:11,670 --&gt; 00:02:14,110
be speaking about a whole series of woman
mystics.

46
00:02:14,110 --&gt; 00:02:18,400
And this is really a refreshing change in
his [FOREIGN], but certainly compared

47
00:02:18,400 --&gt; 00:02:22,290
to Kabbalah this is a whole new world of
much more female involvement.

48
00:02:23,370 --&gt; 00:02:27,010
Now, the I'm

49
00:02:27,010 --&gt; 00:02:30,100
going to leave Spain for a while and move
into the 17th century, but we'll

50
00:02:30,100 --&gt; 00:02:33,420
come back to these texts of Teresa of
Avila and San Juan de la Cruz.

51
00:02:35,000 --&gt; 00:02:37,478
In 17th century Flanders, that's more or
less

52
00:02:37,478 --&gt; 00:02:40,518
modern Belgium we've got a very
interesting figure.

53
00:02:40,518 --&gt; 00:02:50,078
Antoinette Bourignon who had a very
interesting social criticism.

54
00:02:50,078 --&gt; 00:02:52,282
When she was a child, she asked her
parents,

55
00:02:52,282 --&gt; 00:02:56,130
are we living in a Christian country?
And her parents said, of course.

56
00:02:56,130 --&gt; 00:03:01,980
She said, why are people living in sort of
rich wealthy situations with nice

57
00:03:01,980 --&gt; 00:03:05,850
houses, and Jesus was born in a stable and
he spoke to the poor?

58
00:03:05,850 --&gt; 00:03:07,260
Blessed are the poor.

59
00:03:07,260 --&gt; 00:03:10,580
Now, this is the beginning of the rise of
the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie

60
00:03:10,580 --&gt; 00:03:14,040
developed bourgeois life, really developed
in the

61
00:03:14,040 --&gt; 00:03:16,490
17th century, Flanders in Belgium, in
Holland.

62
00:03:18,310 --&gt; 00:03:21,500
And this is her social critique of, of
this.

63
00:03:21,500 --&gt; 00:03:22,560
This is just as a child.

64
00:03:22,560 --&gt; 00:03:24,730
Now, it gets better.

65
00:03:24,730 --&gt; 00:03:28,430
Then she develops this whole religious
critique, what we call Antinomian,

66
00:03:28,430 --&gt; 00:03:32,170
against the normus, the law, psychology,
that the soul, this is

67
00:03:32,170 --&gt; 00:03:35,700
what we're speaking about before, the soul
doesn't need and when

68
00:03:35,700 --&gt; 00:03:39,660
it reaches a higher state it doesn't need
out, outward observance.

69
00:03:39,660 --&gt; 00:03:42,790
When you get to this higher state, again,
the external rules are relaxed.

70
00:03:42,790 --&gt; 00:03:43,480
That's step one.

71
00:03:44,640 --&gt; 00:03:51,310
Now the second thing is, she says go
beyond reading, because anything you read

72
00:03:51,310 --&gt; 00:03:54,110
in a book, either way, if it

73
00:03:54,110 --&gt; 00:03:57,120
doesn't resonate with something inside
it's not meaningful.

74
00:03:57,120 --&gt; 00:03:58,710
If it resonates with something inside
you've

75
00:03:58,710 --&gt; 00:04:00,220
got inside, so you don't really need
books.

76
00:04:00,220 --&gt; 00:04:02,060
So that's the second stage.

77
00:04:02,060 --&gt; 00:04:05,160
She says, the true Church, this is the
third stage actually,

78
00:04:05,160 --&gt; 00:04:07,790
now, against outward observance, against

79
00:04:07,790 --&gt; 00:04:09,760
books, now against, against the
bourgeoisie.

80
00:04:09,760 --&gt; 00:04:11,600
It's actually an earlier one.

81
00:04:11,600 --&gt; 00:04:14,350
Against the church against the religious

82
00:04:14,350 --&gt; 00:04:17,740
structures, the economic structures, the
intellectual structures.

83
00:04:17,740 --&gt; 00:04:21,520
And she says now that the true Church is
in the heart and the soul of the believer.

84
00:04:21,520 --&gt; 00:04:22,910
Again, the heart and the soul.

85
00:04:24,530 --&gt; 00:04:26,870
And then, as an interesting twist here,
just from the point of view of

86
00:04:26,870 --&gt; 00:04:29,190
Jewish mysticism, she says, actually, it's
best

87
00:04:29,190 --&gt; 00:04:30,950
to speak to the Jews about these things.

88
00:04:30,950 --&gt; 00:04:31,690
Why?

89
00:04:31,690 --&gt; 00:04:34,710
Because it's true that they don't believe
in Christ, but the, there's,

90
00:04:34,710 --&gt; 00:04:36,190
they've actually got an advantage, because
they

91
00:04:36,190 --&gt; 00:04:37,790
believe that the Messiah hasn't come yet.

92
00:04:37,790 --&gt; 00:04:39,560
They're waiting for future Messiah.

93
00:04:39,560 --&gt; 00:04:41,570
They don't believe that the Messiah has
already come.

94
00:04:41,570 --&gt; 00:04:44,530
So actually they're more open to
apocalyptic ideas

95
00:04:44,530 --&gt; 00:04:48,720
of overthrowing the social order because
they believe

96
00:04:48,720 --&gt; 00:04:50,280
the Messiah is going to come soon and

97
00:04:50,280 --&gt; 00:04:54,100
create a new world create some kind of
revolution.

98
00:04:54,100 --&gt; 00:04:56,560
Now, I do not believe that it is a
coincidence that this is

99
00:04:56,560 --&gt; 00:04:59,890
written in the 17th century, the same
century in which we had the strongest

100
00:04:59,890 --&gt; 00:05:03,510
messianic movement in Jewish history, the
Sabbatai Zevi movement.

101
00:05:03,510 --&gt; 00:05:05,410
Except perhaps on the [FOREIGN] movement
in the 2nd

102
00:05:05,410 --&gt; 00:05:07,670
century, but that was a very long time
ago.

103
00:05:07,670 --&gt; 00:05:11,730
The, so, again, these connections we,
we're not, in

104
00:05:11,730 --&gt; 00:05:14,170
the we're not in front of an inquisition,
we don't

105
00:05:14,170 --&gt; 00:05:16,750
have to defend ourselves on every single
point in a

106
00:05:16,750 --&gt; 00:05:19,960
legal sense, but to trace the connections
is very important.

107
00:05:21,190 --&gt; 00:05:25,060
And she has interesting trance experiences

108
00:05:25,060 --&gt; 00:05:26,490
which I don't won't to go into, but all of

109
00:05:26,490 --&gt; 00:05:29,710
these insights seem to come from the
experiences in trance.

110
00:05:29,710 --&gt; 00:05:31,654
And trance again it, we spoke about this,

111
00:05:31,654 --&gt; 00:05:34,377
it deep attentiates the mutual frameworks
of reference.

112
00:05:34,377 --&gt; 00:05:37,293
It really opens up new areas, psychic

113
00:05:37,293 --&gt; 00:05:41,954
areas, which can sometimes challenge
traditional formats.

114
00:05:41,954 --&gt; 00:05:43,720
because that's what they do in hypnosis.

115
00:05:43,720 --&gt; 00:05:45,480
Say people have all kinds of habits that
maybe

116
00:05:45,480 --&gt; 00:05:50,070
they want to change whatever, smoking
whatever it can

117
00:05:50,070 --&gt; 00:05:51,600
be, being irritable.

118
00:05:51,600 --&gt; 00:05:53,460
And one can use trance in order to

119
00:05:53,460 --&gt; 00:05:58,750
find new psychic resources to transform
these existing habits.

120
00:05:58,750 --&gt; 00:06:01,890
And this is really how trance works as a
subversive force.

121
00:06:03,560 --&gt; 00:06:07,190
Okay so, I want to move a bit further,
speak about

122
00:06:09,330 --&gt; 00:06:13,520
another late 17th century case in, in
France.

123
00:06:13,520 --&gt; 00:06:17,590
Jeanne Guyon who was also influenced by
Kabbalah.

124
00:06:17,590 --&gt; 00:06:19,070
Just really to wrap up the

125
00:06:21,320 --&gt; 00:06:26,440
just given some names and some things one
can explore by oneself and I want

126
00:06:26,440 --&gt; 00:06:29,180
to get to my main case study which we'll
dwell on for quite a while.
