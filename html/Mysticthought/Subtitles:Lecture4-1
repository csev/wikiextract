1
00:00:03,792 --&gt; 00:00:08,590
So we, we want to move now to the
Byzantine or Orthodox mystical

2
00:00:08,590 --&gt; 00:00:13,720
world, the world of the Eastern churches,
the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches.

3
00:00:13,720 --&gt; 00:00:15,736
We're speaking really geographically if
we're

4
00:00:15,736 --&gt; 00:00:18,350
speaking of really after the 16th century.

5
00:00:18,350 --&gt; 00:00:20,760
So we're not speaking anymore about Turkey
but we are speaking

6
00:00:20,760 --&gt; 00:00:27,580
about the Balkans, especially Greece,
Romania and big parts of Russia.

7
00:00:27,580 --&gt; 00:00:29,060
So we're really

8
00:00:29,060 --&gt; 00:00:32,290
speaking about the Eastern part of Europe.

9
00:00:32,290 --&gt; 00:00:33,690
Now, why did I start with Eastern

10
00:00:33,690 --&gt; 00:00:35,810
Europe rather than with Western or Central
Europe?

11
00:00:36,868 --&gt; 00:00:39,820
This is because I'm speaking about a
movement.

12
00:00:39,820 --&gt; 00:00:42,090
Hesychasm, the mystical movement of the

13
00:00:42,090 --&gt; 00:00:46,680
eastern churches, of Byzantine Orthodox
Churches.

14
00:00:46,680 --&gt; 00:00:50,214
And this movement, we can find the strong,
not the strongest, but

15
00:00:50,214 --&gt; 00:00:54,244
strong evidence for contact of the
mystical movement that we spoke about with

16
00:00:54,244 --&gt; 00:00:57,220
the Hasidic world in the 18th century.

17
00:00:57,220 --&gt; 00:01:00,520
Now we'll find similar context also when
we move to Western Europe, but

18
00:01:00,520 --&gt; 00:01:04,660
here the con, context are quite striking,
and it's a good place to start.

19
00:01:04,660 --&gt; 00:01:07,440
because we're using really again the
method of controlled

20
00:01:07,440 --&gt; 00:01:11,390
comparison, we'll see parallels today with
the Muslim world which

21
00:01:11,390 --&gt; 00:01:13,330
was still active and is still active in
the

22
00:01:13,330 --&gt; 00:01:18,068
Balkan area, we'll see parallels with even
developments further east.

23
00:01:18,068 --&gt; 00:01:18,948
Of course Russia,

24
00:01:18,948 --&gt; 00:01:23,500
we're speaking about the Eurasian context,
the Asian context is not far behind.

25
00:01:23,500 --&gt; 00:01:26,605
Also when we're speaking about Turkey and
countries

26
00:01:26,605 --&gt; 00:01:29,089
like that which and we'll speak also about

27
00:01:29,089 --&gt; 00:01:32,263
other Mediterranean countries when we
speak about the

28
00:01:32,263 --&gt; 00:01:36,014
earlier routes of Hesychasm of the
Orthodox mysticism.

29
00:01:36,014 --&gt; 00:01:38,188
So the East is not far away.

30
00:01:38,188 --&gt; 00:01:41,240
However, again the method of controlled
comparison

31
00:01:41,240 --&gt; 00:01:43,550
is always to focus on modern Europe.

32
00:01:43,550 --&gt; 00:01:44,160
And especially

33
00:01:44,160 --&gt; 00:01:48,320
to focus on movements or developments
where there may have been contact

34
00:01:48,320 --&gt; 00:01:53,460
with Kabbalistic developments as well, due
to our central focus on Kabbalah.

35
00:01:53,460 --&gt; 00:01:58,280
Now, again due to the central focus, I'm
not a scholar of, of Hesychasm.

36
00:01:58,280 --&gt; 00:01:59,440
I'm a Kabbalah scholar.

37
00:01:59,440 --&gt; 00:02:02,250
I meant to read these texts as a Kabbalah
scholar.

38
00:02:02,250 --&gt; 00:02:08,240
We'll be focusing on the more striking
parallels to Kabbalistic Hasidic thought.

39
00:02:08,240 --&gt; 00:02:09,170
I'll try and give my own

40
00:02:09,170 --&gt; 00:02:12,530
take on it, I don't have any pretense to
expertise here, so forgive

41
00:02:12,530 --&gt; 00:02:15,640
me for, I don't always transliterate or

42
00:02:15,640 --&gt; 00:02:18,840
pronounce the Greek or Russian terms
correctly.

43
00:02:18,840 --&gt; 00:02:23,890
Now, what I want to do now, is because of
this difference, where,

44
00:02:23,890 --&gt; 00:02:28,000
whereas in the case of the Kabbalistic
text we did a close reading.

45
00:02:28,000 --&gt; 00:02:29,140
Of Rabbi Kook's text.

46
00:02:29,140 --&gt; 00:02:31,170
Here I want to do what's called a
semi-close reading.

47
00:02:31,170 --&gt; 00:02:34,330
That is, I'm not going to have the text in
front of you, I'm going to

48
00:02:34,330 --&gt; 00:02:35,990
summarize a couple of texts.

49
00:02:35,990 --&gt; 00:02:38,150
But semi-close because I'm not going to

50
00:02:38,150 --&gt; 00:02:42,100
summarize entire chapters in one fast
swoop.

51
00:02:42,100 --&gt; 00:02:47,750
But really, read it almost to the level of
a page, not a paragraph but of a page.

52
00:02:47,750 --&gt; 00:02:51,760
Now I want to speak a bit about the
pre-modern roots of Hesychasm

53
00:02:51,760 --&gt; 00:02:56,470
and focus on those things which are
relevant to our theme, to psychology.

54
00:02:56,470 --&gt; 00:02:59,600
Now, we don't focus much on the
pre-modern, so I'll go through this

55
00:02:59,600 --&gt; 00:03:00,300
rather quickly.

56
00:03:01,390 --&gt; 00:03:04,910
Basically, we're speaking about a movement
which grows out of

57
00:03:04,910 --&gt; 00:03:10,060
the monastic movement of the Desert
Fathers in various locations.

58
00:03:10,060 --&gt; 00:03:12,940
And the strong location here, which is of
course close to my

59
00:03:12,940 --&gt; 00:03:16,370
heart, in terms of my own region, is in,
in Palestine, in Gaza.

60
00:03:17,440 --&gt; 00:03:21,330
And we'll speak soon about Sinai, which is
not far from here, in Egypt.

61
00:03:23,030 --&gt; 00:03:25,350
Where I used to go every every

62
00:03:25,350 --&gt; 00:03:26,940
spring as a child.

63
00:03:26,940 --&gt; 00:03:30,400
And we'll be speaking about re, religions
which

64
00:03:30,400 --&gt; 00:03:34,910
are very close to where I'm sitting
relatively speaking.

65
00:03:34,910 --&gt; 00:03:40,165
Now, this movement developed especially
around the turn of the

66
00:03:40,165 --&gt; 00:03:45,680
millennium, the writings of Symeon the,
the New Theologian around the year 1000.

67
00:03:45,680 --&gt; 00:03:49,930
And another big wave of development in the
14th century,

68
00:03:49,930 --&gt; 00:03:52,570
especially two figures, the two Gregorys,
Gregory

69
00:03:52,570 --&gt; 00:03:55,570
of Palamas and Gregory of Sinai, again,
Sinai.

70
00:03:56,770 --&gt; 00:03:59,780
And then another big wave in the 18th,
19th

71
00:03:59,780 --&gt; 00:04:03,450
century which have took place in Greece
and in Russia.

72
00:04:03,450 --&gt; 00:04:05,210
And really in the history of the movement

73
00:04:05,210 --&gt; 00:04:08,830
one specific location in Greece is very
important.

74
00:04:08,830 --&gt; 00:04:11,230
That's the monastery on Mt Athos.

75
00:04:11,230 --&gt; 00:04:13,260
Where in the 14th century, not at the

76
00:04:13,260 --&gt; 00:04:16,570
same time but the two Gregorys had periods
there.

77
00:04:16,570 --&gt; 00:04:21,330
And really Athos became to a large extent
the center of the Hesychast movement.

78
00:04:21,330 --&gt; 00:04:24,380
Now, this is, gives the geographical
frame.

79
00:04:24,380 --&gt; 00:04:27,490
We've got the origins in the fourth, fifth
century.

80
00:04:27,490 --&gt; 00:04:29,270
We've got distant origins.

81
00:04:29,270 --&gt; 00:04:31,840
We've got a certain wave around the year
1000.

82
00:04:31,840 --&gt; 00:04:36,010
We have a bigger wave in the 14th century.

83
00:04:36,010 --&gt; 00:04:38,917
Accompanied, as we often find with
mystical movements like

84
00:04:38,917 --&gt; 00:04:42,880
controversies, there's a big controversy
in the fourth century.

85
00:04:42,880 --&gt; 00:04:45,710
Gregory of Palamas defends the Hesychast
movement,

86
00:04:45,710 --&gt; 00:04:47,920
and another move in the 18th, 19th

87
00:04:47,920 --&gt; 00:04:51,890
century, which we'll focus on soon, I
think that's the main focus for today.

88
00:04:51,890 --&gt; 00:04:54,570
And another big wave today is actually

89
00:04:54,570 --&gt; 00:04:57,120
a book about the global revival of
Hesychasm.

90
00:04:58,220 --&gt; 00:05:00,585
Again, I'll not always trouble you with
all the details of every

91
00:05:00,585 --&gt; 00:05:03,410
single book, just to know that there is a
book about that.

92
00:05:03,410 --&gt; 00:05:08,830
And the, there's certainly a revival of
certain techniques.

93
00:05:08,830 --&gt; 00:05:11,850
Now I want to speak about two themes in a
movement.

94
00:05:11,850 --&gt; 00:05:14,300
The somatic and the psychological.

95
00:05:14,300 --&gt; 00:05:16,110
But of course also meet with, I would,

96
00:05:16,110 --&gt; 00:05:19,280
you could call it a psychosomatic form of
mysticism.

97
00:05:19,280 --&gt; 00:05:21,817
But first I want to speak about the
physical aspects

98
00:05:21,817 --&gt; 00:05:24,790
of the move, of the techniques developed
in the movement.

99
00:05:25,960 --&gt; 00:05:30,110
The focus here is on mantra-like and I'm

100
00:05:30,110 --&gt; 00:05:34,730
deliberately using the Eastern term,
repetition of short phrases

101
00:05:34,730 --&gt; 00:05:37,420
related to the name of God, related to the
name of

102
00:05:37,420 --&gt; 00:05:41,520
Jesus, and especially a very brief text
known as the Jesus prayer.

103
00:05:43,210 --&gt; 00:05:45,430
Which has various versions, but the gist
of it

104
00:05:45,430 --&gt; 00:05:49,280
is Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a
sinner.

105
00:05:50,390 --&gt; 00:05:52,730
Now we've got three ideas here.

106
00:05:52,730 --&gt; 00:05:55,080
We've got the idea of the mercy of Christ,
we've

107
00:05:55,080 --&gt; 00:05:59,660
got the idea of the me, the self, whatever
it is.

108
00:05:59,660 --&gt; 00:06:00,610
That needs mercy.

109
00:06:00,610 --&gt; 00:06:03,100
And the definition of the self through
sin.

110
00:06:03,100 --&gt; 00:06:05,758
And these are three themes that will recur
in today's discussion.

111
00:06:05,758 --&gt; 00:06:12,700
Now, the idea of repetition is not mere
repetition.

112
00:06:12,700 --&gt; 00:06:14,810
But just like in far Eastern techniques
and

113
00:06:14,810 --&gt; 00:06:19,300
also near Eastern techniques of Islamic
mysticism, of Sufism.

114
00:06:19,300 --&gt; 00:06:24,170
We have idea of repetition of phrases,
accompanied by two things.

115
00:06:24,170 --&gt; 00:06:25,760
One is by breathing.

116
00:06:25,760 --&gt; 00:06:30,130
That is, the repetition is paced through
breath.

117
00:06:30,130 --&gt; 00:06:33,930
That is, so we've got the, the phrase
itself, which

118
00:06:33,930 --&gt; 00:06:37,760
through repetition sort of engraves itself
on the unconscious mind.

119
00:06:37,760 --&gt; 00:06:38,870
The idea of repetition.

120
00:06:39,870 --&gt; 00:06:45,830
Create an unconscious clusters of meaning,
is well known from hypnosis.

121
00:06:45,830 --&gt; 00:06:47,768
We've got the, the use of breathing, which

122
00:06:47,768 --&gt; 00:06:49,740
is very common in the entire mystical
world.

123
00:06:50,750 --&gt; 00:06:52,410
The idea of breathing, I think, is because
it's

124
00:06:52,410 --&gt; 00:06:55,160
a sort of bridge between the conscious and
the unconscious.

125
00:06:56,350 --&gt; 00:06:59,060
So something which we have conscious
control of, but

126
00:06:59,060 --&gt; 00:07:01,110
we're not entirely conscious of it most of
the time.

127
00:07:02,320 --&gt; 00:07:05,600
And then a third thing is visualing
psychic centers.

128
00:07:05,600 --&gt; 00:07:09,980
The idea is to descend from the head into
the heart

129
00:07:09,980 --&gt; 00:07:13,070
especially, that's why it's often called
the prayer of the heart.

130
00:07:14,070 --&gt; 00:07:15,870
And also descending even further below
into

131
00:07:15,870 --&gt; 00:07:20,034
the navel, again reminiscent of eastern
techniques related to the hara,

132
00:07:20,034 --&gt; 00:07:23,590
this, the, the, the belly, the tan t'ian,
the navel area.

133
00:07:23,590 --&gt; 00:07:27,759
I use a Japanese term, the Chinese term is
dantian or tan t'ian.

134
00:07:27,759 --&gt; 00:07:31,720
So the idea is to focus on what's called
psychic centers.

135
00:07:31,720 --&gt; 00:07:34,950
That if one centers in along the center
line of

136
00:07:34,950 --&gt; 00:07:38,710
the body, on certain areas which are both
physically significant.

137
00:07:38,710 --&gt; 00:07:39,940
The heart obviously.

138
00:07:39,940 --&gt; 00:07:41,340
The navel, that's where

139
00:07:41,340 --&gt; 00:07:43,440
we got our nutrition before we were born.

140
00:07:43,440 --&gt; 00:07:47,100
It's where a lot of the breathing happens,
the internal organs.

141
00:07:47,100 --&gt; 00:07:50,184
But also psychologically, emotions are on
the heart.

142
00:07:50,184 --&gt; 00:07:52,530
Emotional intelligence, if we could call
it, in, in

143
00:07:52,530 --&gt; 00:07:54,860
the guts, gut feeling, you know, in the
stomach.

144
00:07:54,860 --&gt; 00:07:56,960
So that's the third element.

145
00:07:56,960 --&gt; 00:07:59,880
We've got repetition breathing, and
naturally breathing will, we

146
00:07:59,880 --&gt; 00:08:02,160
breathe into the chest, we breathe into
the belly.

147
00:08:02,160 --&gt; 00:08:06,600
And another thing is the idea of light,

148
00:08:06,600 --&gt; 00:08:09,290
that one has to imagine these psychic
centers filled with light.

149
00:08:10,530 --&gt; 00:08:14,070
Now, here I've more or less summarized the
history of

150
00:08:14,070 --&gt; 00:08:17,370
the movements and I've summarized the
somatic techniques, and what

151
00:08:17,370 --&gt; 00:08:19,140
we're going to do now is we're going to go

152
00:08:19,140 --&gt; 00:08:23,180
into more detail about the psychological
aspects of the movement.

153
00:08:23,180 --&gt; 00:08:25,430
So, already we focused on the idea of the
heart.

154
00:08:26,980 --&gt; 00:08:30,850
And we focused on the idea of constant
prayer.

155
00:08:30,850 --&gt; 00:08:31,900
The whole idea of a Jesus

156
00:08:31,900 --&gt; 00:08:35,680
prayer is one of constant prayer, of
praying all the time.

157
00:08:35,680 --&gt; 00:08:38,390
Constantly repeating this phrase and
others, prayer

158
00:08:38,390 --&gt; 00:08:39,850
not as something which happens at set,

159
00:08:39,850 --&gt; 00:08:42,200
designated times during the day in some

160
00:08:42,200 --&gt; 00:08:44,780
ritual context, but as a constant
occupation.

161
00:08:44,780 --&gt; 00:08:50,770
And now, what I want to do in the next
section, subsection, is to focus a bit

162
00:08:50,770 --&gt; 00:08:54,070
more geographically on the 18th, 19th
century and the

163
00:08:54,070 --&gt; 00:08:56,930
possible meeting of Hasidism, and to focus
also more

164
00:08:56,930 --&gt; 00:08:57,690
on the psychological.
