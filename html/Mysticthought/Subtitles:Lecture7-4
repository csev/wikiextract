1
00:00:00,460 --&gt; 00:00:03,520
Now I want to speak about the whole issue
of psychology and

2
00:00:03,520 --&gt; 00:00:05,930
spirituality, because basically I was
speaking

3
00:00:05,930 --&gt; 00:00:08,540
about two phases in the 20th century.

4
00:00:08,540 --&gt; 00:00:12,993
First of all, the question of what is a
place of mysticism in early 20th

5
00:00:12,993 --&gt; 00:00:16,789
century psychology, and I focused mostly
on psychoanalysis

6
00:00:16,789 --&gt; 00:00:20,238
because it developed, I think the, richest
theory.

7
00:00:20,238 --&gt; 00:00:22,630
There could be in practice that there are
other methods

8
00:00:22,630 --&gt; 00:00:25,542
which are more effective, like hypnosis,
but which also greatly

9
00:00:25,542 --&gt; 00:00:29,410
developed in the 20th century.
I spoke about Milton Erickson, et cetera.

10
00:00:29,410 --&gt; 00:00:32,940
But the theoretical development in early
20th century through

11
00:00:32,940 --&gt; 00:00:36,280
psychoanalysis and one of the things that
we pointed at,

12
00:00:36,280 --&gt; 00:00:38,740
and it's worth going into a bit more now,
is

13
00:00:38,740 --&gt; 00:00:44,070
the strong place of mysticism in the
beginnings of psychoanalysis.

14
00:00:44,070 --&gt; 00:00:46,360
The importance of Jung who has a greater
role in the

15
00:00:46,360 --&gt; 00:00:50,450
development of movement that has been
recognized by some of his historians.

16
00:00:50,450 --&gt; 00:00:54,000
And the goal of mysticism in Jung's own
life and here's the

17
00:00:54,000 --&gt; 00:00:57,370
importance of texts, even when we are
speaking about the 20th century.

18
00:00:57,370 --&gt; 00:00:59,330
What we've got is a tremendous find

19
00:00:59,330 --&gt; 00:01:02,180
which revolutionized the study of Jungian
psychology.

20
00:01:02,180 --&gt; 00:01:03,520
Jung's red book.

21
00:01:03,520 --&gt; 00:01:05,950
His record of his own personal visions.

22
00:01:05,950 --&gt; 00:01:08,720
And here we see, what we see in many cases
of mystics.

23
00:01:08,720 --&gt; 00:01:12,330
That he has the visions, he has the
experience, however the

24
00:01:12,330 --&gt; 00:01:15,590
next step is to create a theoretical
structure out of his

25
00:01:15,590 --&gt; 00:01:18,440
own experience.
And this is what made Jung into Jung.

26
00:01:18,440 --&gt; 00:01:20,770
If it was just visions, went unpublished.

27
00:01:20,770 --&gt; 00:01:24,530
This is a backdrop for his theory, his our
own personal experience

28
00:01:24,530 --&gt; 00:01:29,540
but what was published, what was made
available is the theoretical structure.

29
00:01:29,540 --&gt; 00:01:31,100
And today we've got The Red Book so we can

30
00:01:31,100 --&gt; 00:01:35,120
see how intimately the theoretical
structure and experience are related.

31
00:01:35,120 --&gt; 00:01:39,220
But nevertheless, his public face is that
of the theoretical structure.

32
00:01:40,330 --&gt; 00:01:41,170
So we have

33
00:01:41,170 --&gt; 00:01:44,000
from the beginning, a strong mystical
streak in psychoanalysis.

34
00:01:45,050 --&gt; 00:01:46,810
And with this ups and downs, I just want
to

35
00:01:46,810 --&gt; 00:01:51,420
mention two more figures from a later part
of the century.

36
00:01:51,420 --&gt; 00:01:54,480
One is Wilfred Bion, a very deep thinker
in the school

37
00:01:54,480 --&gt; 00:01:59,080
of Melanie Klein that I've discussed and
developed his own independent approach.

38
00:01:59,080 --&gt; 00:02:03,650
And Bion if you look in the bibliography
of his books, you will find [INAUDIBLE].

39
00:02:03,650 --&gt; 00:02:06,620
You'll see that he [INAUDIBLE], and he
learned, and he understood

40
00:02:06,620 --&gt; 00:02:10,380
quite a lot about [INAUDIBLE], in a very
deep way I think.

41
00:02:10,380 --&gt; 00:02:13,370
And then a student of his, Michael Eigen,
who's now

42
00:02:13,370 --&gt; 00:02:18,850
popularized in, I'll say in a positive
sense beyond his work.

43
00:02:18,850 --&gt; 00:02:22,090
Brings Kabbalah much more into his
discourse, in a much more open way.

44
00:02:22,090 --&gt; 00:02:26,340
Yet not so much of a textual basis, not in
a way that we will work in here.

45
00:02:26,340 --&gt; 00:02:27,510
And here I want to make another sort

46
00:02:27,510 --&gt; 00:02:31,720
of strong theoretical, methodological
statement, which, because what,

47
00:02:31,720 --&gt; 00:02:33,280
what's the great important of methodology?

48
00:02:33,280 --&gt; 00:02:36,900
As I said at the beginning of the course,
what we give in here is the tools of

49
00:02:36,900 --&gt; 00:02:39,190
the trade, is how to work, how to study,

50
00:02:39,190 --&gt; 00:02:41,910
how to approach texts, how to approach a
topic.

51
00:02:41,910 --&gt; 00:02:45,020
The information is endless, there's no
point in giving too much information

52
00:02:45,020 --&gt; 00:02:47,480
in a course because you can find it all on
the internet today.

53
00:02:48,640 --&gt; 00:02:53,110
The question is how to assimilate, to
digest, to process this information

54
00:02:53,110 --&gt; 00:02:58,010
and that's why it's important to speak
about issues of methodology just

55
00:02:58,010 --&gt; 00:03:01,400
like in science how to set up an
experiment, etcetera.

56
00:03:01,400 --&gt; 00:03:03,980
Now I want to say two things.

57
00:03:03,980 --&gt; 00:03:10,190
One is that there was a choice made at the
beginning of the course where I could

58
00:03:10,190 --&gt; 00:03:14,232
have explained how psychoanalysis sees
mysticism, and focused on

59
00:03:14,232 --&gt; 00:03:17,770
Jung, and later Eigon and Bion and other
people.

60
00:03:17,770 --&gt; 00:03:19,510
And I could have interpreted mystical text

61
00:03:19,510 --&gt; 00:03:22,200
through psychoanalysis, which I did here
and there.

62
00:03:22,200 --&gt; 00:03:23,440
But what was far more important

63
00:03:23,440 --&gt; 00:03:25,480
for me, is to give the respect of a

64
00:03:25,480 --&gt; 00:03:29,040
tradition and to say tradition has its own
psychology.

65
00:03:29,040 --&gt; 00:03:32,270
It has its own ideas of what the soul is,
what the heart is, how the

66
00:03:32,270 --&gt; 00:03:34,740
psyche works, how the mind works, how the

67
00:03:34,740 --&gt; 00:03:39,010
social structure works in interaction of
psychology, social psychology.

68
00:03:39,010 --&gt; 00:03:40,040
No one idea.

69
00:03:40,040 --&gt; 00:03:45,700
As I said, many ideas, a great complexity,
which I brought just a small sample of.

70
00:03:45,700 --&gt; 00:03:46,840
And I think this is the way to go.

71
00:03:46,840 --&gt; 00:03:48,760
So that's one

72
00:03:48,760 --&gt; 00:03:50,390
thing to emphasize.

73
00:03:50,390 --&gt; 00:03:53,750
The second thing is, there has been this
big shift with the globalization of

74
00:03:53,750 --&gt; 00:03:57,270
mysticism, and from the globalization of
mysticism

75
00:03:57,270 --&gt; 00:04:01,230
onwards, there's less focus on specific
traditions.

76
00:04:01,230 --&gt; 00:04:04,542
Because we all somehow become blended,
become merged in

77
00:04:04,542 --&gt; 00:04:07,280
a big sort of melting pot of global
mysticism.

78
00:04:08,570 --&gt; 00:04:11,090
And this, of course, is very much to do
with economics.

79
00:04:11,090 --&gt; 00:04:14,000
Because if you want to mass market
Kabbalah,

80
00:04:14,000 --&gt; 00:04:18,364
you can't present Kabbalah, the way the
text itself as we've seen presented.

81
00:04:18,364 --&gt; 00:04:21,050
Something, Jewish Kabbalah at least,
intended

82
00:04:21,050 --&gt; 00:04:23,080
more for Jewish people, related to the

83
00:04:23,080 --&gt; 00:04:26,510
observance of the commandments of the
Jewish law, and so on and so forth.

84
00:04:26,510 --&gt; 00:04:28,090
Related to the study of the sacred Jewish

85
00:04:28,090 --&gt; 00:04:32,520
texts, because then that would completely
restrict the market.

86
00:04:32,520 --&gt; 00:04:34,910
So one has to present Kabbalah as
something much more universal.

87
00:04:36,250 --&gt; 00:04:38,710
So this is true of other traditions.

88
00:04:38,710 --&gt; 00:04:39,220
Look what happened

89
00:04:39,220 --&gt; 00:04:40,950
with Sufism, which I didn't discuss much,

90
00:04:40,950 --&gt; 00:04:43,720
Islamic mysticism, when it comes to the
west.

91
00:04:43,720 --&gt; 00:04:46,400
The whole connection to Islam becomes
weakened.

92
00:04:46,400 --&gt; 00:04:48,920
The whole connection to the Sharia, to the
Islamic law,

93
00:04:48,920 --&gt; 00:04:51,430
to the Koran, and to its interpretation,
the fact that

94
00:04:51,430 --&gt; 00:04:55,160
so many Sufi texts are commentaries on the
Koran, and

95
00:04:55,160 --&gt; 00:04:58,720
deeply imbued with Koran, like the great
mystic Ethan Alabe.

96
00:04:58,720 --&gt; 00:05:02,210
That all the time, he thinks Koranic
verses and so on, and legal principles.

97
00:05:03,720 --&gt; 00:05:04,400
And all

98
00:05:04,400 --&gt; 00:05:07,120
of this is somewhat forgotten in the move
to the west, and then you

99
00:05:07,120 --&gt; 00:05:09,180
can start talking about Sufi psychology
and

100
00:05:09,180 --&gt; 00:05:10,480
compare it to Jung, et cetera, et cetera.

101
00:05:10,480 --&gt; 00:05:12,500
It becomes much easier.

102
00:05:12,500 --&gt; 00:05:16,560
So psychologization goes together with
globalization.

103
00:05:16,560 --&gt; 00:05:19,010
We have what's called psycho-spirituality.

104
00:05:19,010 --&gt; 00:05:21,170
It's a term from William Parsons, I
believe.

105
00:05:21,170 --&gt; 00:05:26,040
That we start speaking about spirituality
instead of mysticism.

106
00:05:27,050 --&gt; 00:05:31,200
And because we've got a much more wider
category and

107
00:05:31,200 --&gt; 00:05:32,620
we start speaking about it in much more

108
00:05:32,620 --&gt; 00:05:36,390
psychological terms, in less traditional
terms, much less

109
00:05:36,390 --&gt; 00:05:39,340
related to specific traditions that more
and more

110
00:05:39,340 --&gt; 00:05:43,810
globalized language with is very much that
of psychology.

111
00:05:43,810 --&gt; 00:05:46,590
Now this has many positive effects, it's
developed a whole

112
00:05:46,590 --&gt; 00:05:51,640
dialogue between mysticism or spirituality
let's call it and psychology.

113
00:05:51,640 --&gt; 00:05:52,930
For instance, a lot of people in

114
00:05:52,930 --&gt; 00:05:55,860
psychology today are interested in Buddha
psychology.

115
00:05:55,860 --&gt; 00:05:56,250
And there's a lot

116
00:05:56,250 --&gt; 00:05:57,640
of interaction going on.

117
00:05:57,640 --&gt; 00:06:00,450
And brain science is becoming interested
in Buddha psychology.

118
00:06:00,450 --&gt; 00:06:02,440
And the Dalai Lama for instance from a
Tibetan

119
00:06:02,440 --&gt; 00:06:05,550
world is copulating with this in an
interesting way.

120
00:06:05,550 --&gt; 00:06:07,880
So all kinds of very interesting
developments are happening which I

121
00:06:07,880 --&gt; 00:06:10,370
didn't go into in this course because it's
not my field.

122
00:06:10,370 --&gt; 00:06:13,150
Brain science and so on and working of
texts.

123
00:06:13,150 --&gt; 00:06:16,520
However, there's also a drawback here.

124
00:06:16,520 --&gt; 00:06:18,960
It very much reinforces presentism.

125
00:06:18,960 --&gt; 00:06:21,310
It led, leads us to forget the historical
depth and

126
00:06:21,310 --&gt; 00:06:25,330
background of traditions and therefore the
richness and complexity of tradition.

127
00:06:25,330 --&gt; 00:06:28,560
Everything becomes a sort of soup and
that's why

128
00:06:28,560 --&gt; 00:06:32,070
Philip Wexler and I entitled our edited
volume After Spirituality.

129
00:06:32,070 --&gt; 00:06:35,950
We want to go beyond spirituality back to
mysticism in a way.

130
00:06:35,950 --&gt; 00:06:38,840
Back to focusing on traditions, back to
focusing on texts,

131
00:06:38,840 --&gt; 00:06:43,550
back to focusing on history, in dialogue
with the psychological world.

132
00:06:43,550 --&gt; 00:06:47,140
However, first of all, seeing what is the
psychology of the texts?

133
00:06:47,140 --&gt; 00:06:50,090
Not to take some kind of generic almost
new age

134
00:06:50,090 --&gt; 00:06:53,525
kind of psychological thinking and project
it onto the text.

135
00:06:53,525 --&gt; 00:06:56,370
But rather emerge, see how it emerges from
the texts.

136
00:06:56,370 --&gt; 00:07:00,370
So that's another point which I want to
stress here in terms of the whole

137
00:07:00,370 --&gt; 00:07:03,010
relationship between mysticism and
psychology, which is of

138
00:07:03,010 --&gt; 00:07:05,770
course the key interrelationship discussed
throughout the course.
