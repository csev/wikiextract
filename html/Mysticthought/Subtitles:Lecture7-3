1
00:00:00,870 --&gt; 00:00:04,360
So despite everything that I've said now
about presentism, I

2
00:00:04,360 --&gt; 00:00:06,990
do want to speak a lot about the 20th
century.

3
00:00:06,990 --&gt; 00:00:10,580
because the 20th century was a major,
major golden age of mysticism.

4
00:00:10,580 --&gt; 00:00:13,310
And when I say 20th, I also mean the early
21st.

5
00:00:13,310 --&gt; 00:00:15,780
Of course, whatever these 13, 14 years.

6
00:00:16,890 --&gt; 00:00:20,080
So now I want to point out something very
interesting, which

7
00:00:20,080 --&gt; 00:00:22,381
I've already mentioned, but I want to
really highlight it now.

8
00:00:22,381 --&gt; 00:00:26,090
That the early 20th century was at

9
00:00:26,090 --&gt; 00:00:30,020
the same time the beginning of major
developments in social

10
00:00:30,020 --&gt; 00:00:34,170
science, Max Weber, and Durkheim,
especially in sociology of religion.

11
00:00:35,340 --&gt; 00:00:40,400
And with major developments in religious
studies, the study of mysticism

12
00:00:40,400 --&gt; 00:00:44,910
academically, like William James's book on
The Varieties of Religious Experience.

13
00:00:44,910 --&gt; 00:00:46,140
And the beginning of psychoanalysis.

14
00:00:46,140 --&gt; 00:00:51,390
And a major wave in other forms of
psychology, cognitive psychology,

15
00:00:51,390 --&gt; 00:00:55,070
gestalt psychology, brain science, which
was, went through a major

16
00:00:55,070 --&gt; 00:00:58,020
shift in the beginning, first part of the
20th century.

17
00:00:58,020 --&gt; 00:01:00,090
And other worlds of psychology, including
the

18
00:01:00,090 --&gt; 00:01:02,160
paranormal, which was a strong field then.

19
00:01:02,160 --&gt; 00:01:05,000
Frederic Myers, the whole spiritualist
movement of

20
00:01:05,000 --&gt; 00:01:07,860
leading academics were part of this
spiritualist movement.

21
00:01:07,860 --&gt; 00:01:11,040
You can read the novels of Arthur Conan
Doyle, was a spiritualist, you can

22
00:01:11,040 --&gt; 00:01:12,420
see all the academic figures that he

23
00:01:12,420 --&gt; 00:01:16,330
brings literally mentioned figures to
support his beliefs.

24
00:01:16,330 --&gt; 00:01:22,030
It was a major, cultural ferment happening
at the time, which has all

25
00:01:22,030 --&gt; 00:01:23,660
this expression, the beginning of Kabbalah

26
00:01:23,660 --&gt; 00:01:26,390
scholarship in the modern sense, Gershom
Scholem.

27
00:01:26,390 --&gt; 00:01:28,320
And many other developments.

28
00:01:28,320 --&gt; 00:01:31,990
And at that same time the golden age of
European mysticism.

29
00:01:31,990 --&gt; 00:01:34,000
The development of Christian Kabbalah at
the

30
00:01:34,000 --&gt; 00:01:36,796
turn of the century, Aleister Crowley and
others.

31
00:01:36,796 --&gt; 00:01:41,840
And the development of

32
00:01:41,840 --&gt; 00:01:45,110
major literary movements which we will
speak about in a moment.

33
00:01:45,110 --&gt; 00:01:48,080
The contact situation what Ilike to call
in which

34
00:01:48,080 --&gt; 00:01:51,580
many Kabbalists congregated on Palestine,
the land of Israel Rabbi

35
00:01:51,580 --&gt; 00:01:55,920
Kook, Rabbi Ashtag and others and
developed a strong Kabbalistic center in

36
00:01:55,920 --&gt; 00:02:01,836
Jerusalem and other places in Israel,
Palestine [UNKNOWN]

37
00:02:01,836 --&gt; 00:02:05,800
and the other developments in
Christianity.

38
00:02:05,800 --&gt; 00:02:06,936
I spoke about the de

39
00:02:06,936 --&gt; 00:02:09,570
Chardin and so on and so forth.

40
00:02:09,570 --&gt; 00:02:12,090
Very strong developments in Hesychasm that
we spoke about, the

41
00:02:12,090 --&gt; 00:02:14,740
move of Hesychasm, beginning of a move to
the west.

42
00:02:14,740 --&gt; 00:02:16,860
And many, many other things I could
mention.

43
00:02:16,860 --&gt; 00:02:19,310
So this period, which was curtailed by the

44
00:02:19,310 --&gt; 00:02:22,240
world wars, Especially by the second World
War.

45
00:02:22,240 --&gt; 00:02:25,120
And as I said a few times, when big wars
are going

46
00:02:25,120 --&gt; 00:02:28,980
on, people do not have the luxury to speak
about mysticism so much.

47
00:02:28,980 --&gt; 00:02:32,280
And, of course, it had a very strong
impact on other areas

48
00:02:32,280 --&gt; 00:02:33,790
for it went into exile.

49
00:02:33,790 --&gt; 00:02:38,750
The whole school of social psychology, the
Frankfurt school, also went into exile.

50
00:02:38,750 --&gt; 00:02:41,660
So there were many developments which
impacted

51
00:02:41,660 --&gt; 00:02:45,770
the development of this tremendous
intellectual firmament.

52
00:02:45,770 --&gt; 00:02:48,790
And after the Second World War, we sort of
restarted from a different basis.

53
00:02:48,790 --&gt; 00:02:51,810
And now what happens after the Second
World War?

54
00:02:51,810 --&gt; 00:02:52,790
And this is very interesting.

55
00:02:54,000 --&gt; 00:02:57,860
The great historian of religion, Mirache
Illiade of Chicago,

56
00:02:57,860 --&gt; 00:02:59,840
not originally, but operated in Chicago

57
00:02:59,840 --&gt; 00:03:02,930
University, He said something very
important.

58
00:03:02,930 --&gt; 00:03:05,930
That one of the major developments of the
latter, second part of the

59
00:03:05,930 --&gt; 00:03:08,510
20th century, after World War Two,

60
00:03:08,510 --&gt; 00:03:12,380
is a globalization of mysticism, religion,
spirituality.

61
00:03:12,380 --&gt; 00:03:14,620
It's that suddenly the horizons become
much wider.

62
00:03:14,620 --&gt; 00:03:16,640
The European world begins to much

63
00:03:16,640 --&gt; 00:03:19,880
more internalize, that there are other
traditions.

64
00:03:19,880 --&gt; 00:03:23,000
These traditions more and more enter
Europe and America.

65
00:03:23,000 --&gt; 00:03:25,920
For instance, take the Japanese tradition,
that Japan

66
00:03:25,920 --&gt; 00:03:28,290
begins to open up after the second World
War.

67
00:03:28,290 --&gt; 00:03:29,960
A lot of Japanese teachers showing us

68
00:03:29,960 --&gt; 00:03:33,294
Suzuki, [INAUDIBLE] Zen teachers move to
United States.

69
00:03:33,294 --&gt; 00:03:38,290
Think of exile from Tibet in the early
1960s, going to Tibetan teachers, Trungpa

70
00:03:38,290 --&gt; 00:03:43,980
et cetera.
Also move into the west and the whole

71
00:03:43,980 --&gt; 00:03:48,300
opening up of, of China after the the

72
00:03:48,300 --&gt; 00:03:50,150
negotiations in the early 1970s with

73
00:03:50,150 --&gt; 00:03:53,150
the United States, the cultural
agreements, etcetera.

74
00:03:53,150 --&gt; 00:03:57,140
The beginning of more exposure to the
whole Chinese world.

75
00:03:57,140 --&gt; 00:03:58,550
Many texts which have come up for

76
00:03:58,550 --&gt; 00:04:01,780
academic studies, Daoist, early Daoist
texts, etcetera.

77
00:04:01,780 --&gt; 00:04:04,450
So from the mid 20th century, it's no

78
00:04:04,450 --&gt; 00:04:09,530
longer possible to speak about mysticism
in isolation.

79
00:04:09,530 --&gt; 00:04:12,760
European mysticism.
It becomes a global arena.

80
00:04:12,760 --&gt; 00:04:13,560
And the globalization

81
00:04:13,560 --&gt; 00:04:16,080
of mysticism has many effects.

82
00:04:16,080 --&gt; 00:04:18,000
And one of it is where one begins to lose

83
00:04:18,000 --&gt; 00:04:21,360
the sense of separate traditions, that
I'll speak about this later.

84
00:04:21,360 --&gt; 00:04:24,720
But other, otherwise it opens up a much
wider discussion.

85
00:04:24,720 --&gt; 00:04:27,530
And of course at this point the control
comparison begins to break down.

86
00:04:27,530 --&gt; 00:04:30,470
So that's why I didn't speak too much
about this period.

87
00:04:30,470 --&gt; 00:04:33,360
But of course this is where we live in.
This is the present.

88
00:04:33,360 --&gt; 00:04:36,250
And the present is a moment of globalized
mysticism.

89
00:04:36,250 --&gt; 00:04:38,580
Which has tremendous support

90
00:04:38,580 --&gt; 00:04:41,850
from technology, just like this course,
from the internet.

91
00:04:41,850 --&gt; 00:04:46,090
And, just like print brought on modernity,
the internet is bringing on a

92
00:04:46,090 --&gt; 00:04:48,620
new form of modernity, maybe
post-modernity or

93
00:04:48,620 --&gt; 00:04:52,370
later modernity, or later modernity even
later.

94
00:04:52,370 --&gt; 00:04:56,375
And, this is making everything much more
rapid global discourse.

95
00:04:56,375 --&gt; 00:04:58,415
And, what happens to individual traditions
is

96
00:04:58,415 --&gt; 00:05:01,060
something we'll need to speak about soon.

97
00:05:01,060 --&gt; 00:05:03,770
But, in a moment I just want to point out
to this huge shift

98
00:05:03,770 --&gt; 00:05:07,300
which takes place from the middle 20th
century onwards.

99
00:05:07,300 --&gt; 00:05:09,080
And also to speak about the great
importance

100
00:05:09,080 --&gt; 00:05:10,210
of the first part of the 20th century.

101
00:05:12,190 --&gt; 00:05:16,022
Now I want to conclude this today by
saying the following.

102
00:05:16,022 --&gt; 00:05:18,564
That as I said, although our focus is

103
00:05:18,564 --&gt; 00:05:23,470
European, and although our focus is
historical and textual.

104
00:05:23,470 --&gt; 00:05:26,020
One cannot ignore the context in which we
write

105
00:05:26,020 --&gt; 00:05:28,670
in or think in or research in at the
moment.

106
00:05:28,670 --&gt; 00:05:31,840
And all of us who are researching
mysticism have to start

107
00:05:31,840 --&gt; 00:05:35,130
taking, to take into account more, the
other traditions, the non-European

108
00:05:35,130 --&gt; 00:05:39,220
traditions, to get out of Eurocentric
focus and to begin to

109
00:05:39,220 --&gt; 00:05:42,860
place our insights from European history
in a much wider context.
