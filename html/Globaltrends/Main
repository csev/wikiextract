<em>Required reading</em>: <strong>“Global Turning Points”, Chapter 1. Welcome to the 21st Century</strong> </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/management/international-business/global-turning-points-understanding-challenges-business-21st-century">Mauro Guillen and Emilio Ontiveros (2012) Global Turning Points, Cambridge University Press</a></p>
<p><br />
(<em>Required readings are available to students during the course</em>)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Global turning points are game-changing events and trends that transform the world and reshape economy, geopolitical affairs, etc. </p>
<p>Examples are the terrorist attack at 9/11, the rise of China as economic power, emerging market trade surpluses versus the deficits of western economies, 25% of largest MNE’s come from emerging market companies, western countries have inverse demographic pyramids (more up 60 than below 20), more countries affected by state failure than ruled by dictators with declining support for current governments, sustainability including food prices are at critical levels, India seems to become the most populated country, Chine the most producing and US the richest.</p>
<p>The 21st century seems to be characterized by both complex and uncertain, paradoxes (wealth shifts)  </p>
<p><br />
<strong>Welcome to Analyzing Global Trends (Video 1.1)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Globalization affects consumer markets, labor markets, financial markets, politics, geopolitics, natural resources and global relationships.</p>
<p>Global trends affect regions in a heterogeneous way and require new programs and products, new business and decision models and a new mindset.</p>
<p>·       More people in cities than in the countryside (2009)</p>
<p>·       More people suffering from obesity than from hunger (2010)</p>
<p>·       Within 20 years largest consumer markets in India and China.</p>
<p>·       Since 1980 more failed states than dictatorships</p>
<p>Globalization manifests through increased cross-border activities, supra-national organizations, spread of ideas and awareness.</p>
<p>Global Economy encompasses increased flows of labor, money, goods and services with the capacity to work as a unit in real time on a planetary scale. It differs from international trade from former centuries.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Measuring Globalization (Video 1.2)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Two approaches to measuring Globalization are aggregate indicators (like growth figures) and via networks (like data cables connecting countries).</p>
<p>Predicting growth often includes the least likely projection where nothing changes, like in the world population growth (now 7 billion).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Understanding the Global Economy (Video 1.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Absolute advantage (Adam Smith 1776) is that something is cheaper elsewhere. Relative Advantage (David Ricardo 1819) uses the differences of prices between different goods.</p>
<p>Other considerations are transportation costs, scales, etc. There are 104.000 MNE’s with 790.000 subsidiaries. The 500 largest account for 25% of world products and 50% of trade. They obtain 80% of all payments for technologies and invest vast amounts in different countries.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Financial Globalization (Video 1.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Examples are foreign portfolio investments, currency markets (10% commercial transactions, 90% bank positions and speculation activities). Interconnection between economies in 2009 made 100% of developed countries been effected by the recession as opposed to 40% round 1990.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Concept of Isomorphism (Video 1.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Globalization is an isomorphic process: the tendency of entities to become more similar or adapt common patterns of behavior. Examples are: the modern nation-state; ministries of foreign affairs; prohibition of child labor, general schooling.</p>
<p>Drivers are normative (shared ideologies), coercive (dependency), mimetic (imitation), emulative (copy driven) and competitive (performance). Some states are more exposed to isomorphic pressure than others, due to dependencies, more embedded in trade, democratic, smaller levels of public spending.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Paradoxes of Globalization (Video 1.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The paradox of predictability is that the global system is highly structured but prone to unpredictable disruptions.</p>
<p>The paradox of coupling is that there is tight coupling of system components (financial, economic, environmental, demographical) but also institutional decoupling.</p>
<p>The paradox of differentiated convergence is that there is isomorphic pressure towards convergence but also differentiation and specialization.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Effects of Globalization (Video 1.7)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Across countries there is less inequality. Within countries the rate of inequality differs.</p>
<p>Argued is that capital (versus labor), educated workers, strong states, economy ministry and rich countries have won from globalization.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Tensions in the Global Landscape (Video 1.8)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Tensions occur at the border between economics, socio-demography, politics and geopolitics. The institutions that can mitigate tensions are the labor market, political system, the state and the international system of states.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_.232:_Demographic_Trends">Week #2: Demographic Trends</span></h1>
<p><br />
<em>Required reading</em>: <strong>”The New Demography”, Chapter 4, Global Turning Points</strong></p>
<p><br />
For the first time several countries have an inverted age pyramid with more 60 years and older than under 20. The life expectancy of people increased worldwide, China will have a shortage of women where in parts of Russia there is a shortage of men and furthermore there is a worldwide decline in the number of children per woman.</p>
<p>Demographic changes will influence politics and economy on a large scale.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Importance of Demography (Video 2.1)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Economic impact of demography affects production (labor, wages, women participation), consumption (size of market, type of consumption) and savings (national and international).</p>
<p>Political impact includes voting behavior, international migration and nationalism.</p>
<p>Welfare State is impacted through national budgets/spending.</p>
<p>Geopolitical impact includes the relation between population size and global power.</p>
<p>Demographic changes can have persisting effect, which is difficult to reverse. Also policies are difficult to design. </p>
<p><br />
<strong>Population Growth (Video 2.2)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Total Fertility Rate and Life Expectancy at Birth are key magnitudes for predictions. Worlds TFR dropped from 5 in 1950 to 2,5 children. All countries diverge to 2. World LE was 50 in 1950 and increased to 70. The total world population of 3.5b in 1950 increased to 6b and will probably be 10b in 2100.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Regional Populations (Video 2.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>From 1950 to 2100, Africa (10-40%) and SC-Asia (20-25-20%; incl. India) both are expected to have major growth as opposed to E-Asia (26-22-12%, incl. China), SE-Asia, W-Asia, Europe (22-10-7%), Latin America. More income and education will decrease TFR.</p>
<p>From 1950 to 2010, the immigration rate in the world remained stable from 2,2-3%. The rate for rich countries increased from 5-11,5%.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Age pyramids (Video 2.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Population pyramids show projection of FR’s. The German Pyramid shows a more rapid aging than in the USA because of lower TFR’s. Spain and Italy show that TFR dropped later.</p>
<p>China shows the 1-child policy by having more men than women. Russia shows both population aging and gender imbalance due to bad lifestyle of men.</p>
<p>Brazil started with a young population (1960), has now a large productive population good for economic growth. India shows the same development.</p>
<p>There is a negative correlation between stock markets and ageing.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Growth of Cities (Video 2.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>World population living in cities increased from 30% (1950) to about 50% by the year 2005 or 2006, and the projection is that by the end of the 21st century, nearly 70% of the world's population will be living in cities</p>
<p>Over 50% now and is projected to become 70% on 2100.  The developed countries are 20% above the average as opposed to the least developed. The biggest cities will be found in South-America and SE-Asia. People in cities consume differently from those in the countryside.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Global Cities (Video 2.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Global cities have identities and importance (economic, finance, politics, culture, diversity) that transcend that of the country where it is located. They tend to be influential, cultural and ethnic diverse, culturally thriving, have an advance infrastructure, rich in business service, open and safe and legally and politically secure.</p>
<p>Drivers of global cities are agglomeration, growth of specialized service firms, coordination function and new communication technologies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, NYC and LA have economies that equal Australia, Mexico and Turkey and are bigger than Holland, etc. Truly global cities are London and NYC. Regional hubs are Singapore, Panama, Miami and Dubai. Gateways are like Hong Kong (into China) and Sidney (into Australia).</p>
<p>Benefits from organizing events like Olympics can be short and long term, tangible and intangible or direct and induced (investments, jobs, tourism, infrastructure, renovation, tax collection, reputation). Other issues include: who pays for the event; are people crowded out because of the fuzz; are they transformational (attract more tourist, investments, etc.). Beneficial Olympics were Seoul 1988 (global city) and Barcelona 1992 (transformational, tourism, renovation). Sidney 2000 (important and attractive), Beijing 2008 (city and country as upcoming powerhouse), London 2012 (renovation and revitalization). Not paying off were Montreal 1976 (not sustaining the hype, residents still pay bonds), Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984 (political tensions), Athens 2004 (infrastructural)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Health Status (Video 2.7)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>From 1970 on, smoking was seen as the biggest problem. Now, more people suffer from obesity (1b), measured by BMI, than from hunger (700m). Examples are US 40%, Europe 30% and Japan less that 2%. Throughout the world the level increases. Reasons are: cheap and bad processed food; changing lifestyle; urbanization.</p>
<p>Healthcare spending increased to up to 30% obese related costs due to chronic problems like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Demographic Trends and the Clothing Industry (Video 2.8)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As a $1,4 trillion business, clothing industry changes through e-tailing, urbanization increased demanding young people, ageing, obesity.</p>
<p>Young people spend more on clothes. Millennials (Y-generation) are stereotyped as confidential, tolerant, community sense, narcissism and hungry for technology.</p>
<p>Firms spend 95% of advertisement on “under-50s” and decided to grow in emerging markets. Online websites (like taobao.com with 1.75m Chinese clients) start to target ageing population.</p>
<p>In 1985 the average US woman size was 8 and in 2013 this was 12-14. The US market for clothes is $300b with only 20% available for obese problem (demand or supply problem?). So $150-180b is not served. Some companies are not interested in that segment and don’t stock large sizes. Some cater to the overweight.</p>
<p>Car design is also influenced by obesity: seats, air bags, safety belts.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_.233:_Inequality_and_the_Global_Middle_Class">Week #3: Inequality and the Global Middle Class</span></h1>
<p><br />
<em>Required reading</em>: <strong>Poverty and Inequality: Persistent Problems and New Solutions, Global TrendLab</strong></p>
<p><br />
While inequality and poverty across countries declined, within countries inequalities have increased. In developed countries this is due to deindustrialization, lower levels of unionization, declined wage shares of national income and financialization of the economy. In developing and emerging countries the growth of cities is causing greater inequalities and cause of the worldwide rise of middle class consumers.</p>
<p>Patterns of poverty have complex origins in culture and social structure and driven by dynamics of labor markets and governments.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Analyzing Poverty and Inequality (Video 3.1)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Inequality refers to the distribution of income across the population. Poverty is on the decrease worldwide but increasing in the US and Europe (16%).</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient (measures inequality with 0 being income equally divided and 100 means 1 has everything) declined from 1980 on (0.57 to 0.49). Without China it has declined from 2005 on (0.57 to 0.54).</p>
<p>In the US, inequality has grown since 1960, the same for China and Russia although later on. South America shows in general a decrease in inequality through government programs.</p>
<p>Another measure is the “Top 1%ers”. In the US this means $394,000 income and $8.4m in wealth. After a decline since 1900 (20%) this figure rose again since 1970 (10%) in countries like Colombia, US, Argentina and Singapore but remained below 10% for Japan, China and most European countries.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Causes of Rising Inequality (Video 3.2)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The causes for rising inequality lies in technological change (skills gap; is not an equalizer), trade (reduced between countries but in US and Europe let to job migration), foreign investments (MNE investing in foreign countries with net benefit to home country), growing service sector (replaced manufacturing jobs with an increasing variety of skills but less paid), welfare state retrenchment (cut benefits, pensions and social security), taxation (labor’s share dropped in Europe and US in favor of capital’s share; high income translates to higher savings and to greater wealth with favorable taxation; taxation on both decreased since 1940 in the US from 50% to 30%) and rising of emerging economies (the Kuznets curve shows inverted U-shape during transition from developing towards developed; elusive curves for China, Russia and US do not match Kuznets but show an increase).</p>
<p>Finally (incompatible) a summary of Gini Coefficients shows a world average of .70, South Africa increasing above .65, Brazil declining to .50, US steadily growing towards .50 and China rocking towards .50 and Sweden remaining at .25.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Is There an Optimal Level of Inequality? (Video 3.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The optimal level depends on the economic, political or moral perspective.</p>
<p>Too little inequality can undermine incentives to work (economists, political). Too much can trigger less investments in education, undermine work ethics, raise social conflict and give political mobilization (Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, etc.).</p>
<p>Inequality patterns shift and tend to squeeze the middle class.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>What’s the Middle Class? (Video 3.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Middle class is historically defined as: between working class and upper class; growth of cities and the new occupations; having different values and political behavior. Today it is defined as: between poor and rich and having discretionary spending power.</p>
<p>It forms the foundation of democracy, social stability (contributing to welfare state) and largest consumer group.</p>
<p>Middle class should be defined within each country, although OECD argues that spend between $10-100 per day defines middle class. Adjusted for the cost of living, for the US this means between $14,600-146,000 annual income for a 4 person family. Rates of world middle class/poor were 15/45 (2000), are 20/50 (2014) and expected 37/37 (2022) and 53/28 (2030).</p>
<p>The distribution of middle class over countries is 50% in Europe/US and 25% Asia now, reversed figures in 2030 and 15-60% in 2050 with China/India 30-20%. Projections are that in China middle class will grow less fast than in India due to inequalities.</p>
<p>Middle class consumption is about $21.3t and expected at a $55.7t in 2030. Per region North America, Europe (emerging part/Eastern) and Asia Pacific this is 5.6/5.8, 8.1/11.3 and 4.9/32.6.</p>
<p>Africa is fast growing in population but lacks 25 years regarding developing a larger middle class.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>India’s Middle Class (Video 3.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>India grew since 1991 (services, manufacturing). India middle class will rise from 15-50% in 2030, with social, political and consumer behavior changing (Tata Nano failure, didn’t fit self-image of aspirational consumer).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Gender, Income and Wealth (Video 3.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Patriarchy is a social system where males own/control property and have authority over women and children.</p>
<p>Legal discrimination consist largely of: 45/128 countries no legal capacity to act; 49/128 cannot work in all industries; 32/128 no equal inheritance rights. Wages inequalities come from job segregations, mommy penalty and plain discrimination.</p>
<p>Nowadays the gap is narrowing due to greater labor force participation and the longer life expectations for women (50+).</p>
<p>Implications for insurance are due to women’s higher preference for retirement planning, future security benefits, rising cost of children’s education.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><br />
<em>Required reading</em>: <strong>Global Risk – New Perspectives and Opportunities, GlobalTrend Lab</strong></p>
<p><br />
US Congress found failing financial regulations and corporate governance, high debt and risk-taking in households and Wall Street and breaches in ethics and accountability as key factors for the crisis. IMF concluded asset price bubbles (housing market), a credit boom (same market) and a decline in lending quality as recurring factors in crises. IMF also pointed out insufficient regulatory actions. Fiscal, national spending and absence of trade protectionism did smoothen the crisis.</p>
<p>Global Governance seems to be absent or fail. Major items include CSR.</p>
<p>The drivers of global instability remain active. Commercial and investment banks are not split, compensation schemes have not been altered and corporate governance has not been improved. Ageing population with different spending and investment characteristics also forms threats.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Global Economy and Financial Architecture (Video 4.1)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The current account of the balance of payment shows whether a country is a surplus or deficit country. Global imbalances grew from+/- 0.5% (1996) to 2.5% (2006) and projected to +/- 1.2% (2018) of global GDP.</p>
<p>Surplus countries (2012) were Germany (17%), China (14%), Saudi Arabia (12%), Kuwait (6%), Switzerland, Holland, Norway, Russia (all 6%). Deficit countries are USA (41%), UK (9%), Canada (6%), France, Australia, Brazil, Turkey (5%), Poland, Italy, Spain (1.5%). Advanced economies (ex. Germany, Japan) are growing net assets from $ -2Tr to $-11Tr in 2024. Net asset countries are foremost the emerging economies.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Changing Geography of Capital Investments (Video 4.2)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In 1912 capital investment center was London. In 1967 it shifted to the USA with Germany and France gaining importance. In 2012 USA, Europe China and Japan are important with major streams to the USA.</p>
<p>China is supposed to overtake the USA GDP before 2020.</p>
<p>Biggest economy: 1500 China; 1888 USA; 2020 China (1840-1942 Europe). Largest trading: 1800 UK; 1960 USA/Germany followed by Japan; 2010 USA, China. Largest Navy: 1800 UK; 1945 USA. Dominant reserve currency: 1800 Pound Sterling; 1945 US$; 2000 US/€.</p>
<p>The Dali Principle is about the level of trust countries have in other countries bonds.</p>
<p>Benefits of being a reserve currency are lower transaction cost, lower interest rate, prestige, power &amp; influence, partner in international negotiations. Requirements are being convertible, free capital flows, liquid security market, fiscal responsibility, and predictable policymaking.</p>
<p>The Spider-Man Principle is that the world needs at least one country that provides a stable currency and liquid security market for other surplus countries. In 2012 60% was allocated in US$, 25% in € and 5% in ¥ and 3% in gold.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Trade Blocs and the Global Economic Landscape (Video 4.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The GATT rounds (1947) are a form of multilateralism and were superseded by the WTO (1986) with 159 member countries.</p>
<p>EU is a trade block with selected members and can reduce tariffs, remove trade barriers, coordinate external barriers, allow free movement of capital and labor, coordinate tax policies, coordinate economic policies, introduce a common currency, merge fiscal and treasury policies and merge banking supervision. First bloc was the German Zollverein (1834). Now there are 259. In the 1990’s there was a trend towards continental blocs (NAFTA, SICA, UNASUR, EU, AU, AL, EFTA, EAEC, ASEAN, etc.).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Why are Trade Blocs Controversial? (Video 4.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Trade blocks can benefit from economies of scale; terms of trade improve (bargaining power, specialization). Welfare implications can be that some countries loose (increased internal competition). Politically, there might be pressure towards democratization, enhanced multilateral negotiations and extension of power over weaker states.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Monetary Unions (Video 4.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Three types of monetary unions are: informal (adopt another currency like Bhutan/Nepal/India, Ecuador/USA); formal (Singapore/Brunei, San Marino/Vatican/Euro); formal plus common policies (EMU, East Caribbean Dollar, Lesotho/Swaziland/Namibia/South Africa).</p>
<p>The Eurozone now has 28 members with 18 members of the EMU. In 1971, 1973 and 1992 there were monetary crises, which lead to pushing towards a monetary union. In 1990 the Wall fell and France wanted the Deutsch Mark to disappear in favor of a common currency.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Why is Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union Not Working? (Video 4.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>EMU did not include a banking union (supervision, resolutions, deposit insurance) and a fiscal union. Consequences of a monetary union are that member countries cannot inflate their debts away and cannot devalue.</p>
<p>In order to work the union needs labor flexibility, a fiscal union (common policy for compensation in private sector) and a banking union.</p>
<p>The cost of borrowing should have balanced excessive debt but it didn’t. Lending to Greece and others accelerated against low rates. A ECB no-bail-out clause should prevent overspending, which it didn’t. The Stability and Growth Pact should force deficit/GDP and gross debt/GDP to stay below 3% and 60%, which in 2005 France and Germany relaxed and others misused this.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The European Crisis (Video 4.7)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Between 2010 and 2013 the interest rates on 10 year bonds increased for Greece (6/58/9%), Portugal (5/18/8%), Ireland (5/14/5%) and Italy/Spain (5/8/5%).</p>
<p>Debt, banks, increasing labor cost between 2000 and 2012 (Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, France 30/40% versus Germany 10%), low labor mobility (US 2.3%, EU 0.2%) and unemployment (Spain and Greece 27%, Portugal 17%, Ireland, Italy and France 12%, Germany 5%) caused the crisis. GDP growth is negative for the defaulting countries.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Possible Solutions to the European Crisis (Video 4.8)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Debate is about austerity measures.</p>
<p>Intra trade within EMU is as high as in Northern America and Asia (48%). Default countries often compete against Germany, which will fail. Germany depends heavily on EU trade, which might turn out a weakness on the long term.</p>
<p>On short term surplus economies should provide stimulus, increase wages and allow marginally higher inflation.</p>
<p>In medium term a fiscal and banking union should be installed and labor markets made more flexible and mobile.</p>

<p><br />
<em>Required reading</em>: <strong>Conflict, Governance and State Fragility, Center for Systemic Peace</strong></p>
<p><br />
Global trends of the last 60 years show that the number of democracies (20-100) and anocracies (30-50) increased and autocracies (20-90-20) sharply increased and leveled back. Main tension areas are found in Africa and South Asia. Most failed or fragile states show the fastest population growth, corruption, rich in natural resources. Good governance is needed.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Global Trends (Video 5.1)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Up till now we covered: population ageing; fast population growth in Africa, South Asia and Middle East; growth of cities; obesity epidemic; increased inequality within countries; decreased inequality between countries; women rise as wealth owners; global financial imbalances.</p>
<p>In 2001 9/11 and China entered WTO.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Political Regimes (Video 5.2)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Distinguished are: autocracy (limited individual rights, little opposition, no separation of powers) in the forms of totalitarian, authoritarian and sultanistic; democracy (individual rights protected); anocracy (characteristics of both former regimes).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Failed States (Video 5.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Failed states have lost control over law and order, cannot provide minimal public services and cannot interact with other states. The number declined over 20 years (80-50) with extreme failures around 10 states, which is the result of ending civil wars.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Armed Conflicts (Video 5.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In the 19th and 20th century interstate war was a dominant form of conflict. From 1945 on civil wars are dominant but both declined since 1995. So called highly localized terrorist victims increased since 1990 to 5000 and back to 2500. The numbers of displaced (4000-27.000) and refugees (6.000-14.000) have increased dramatically in 30 years.</p>

<strong>The Somali Pirates (Video 5.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Piracy began after the Barre regime collapsed in 1991 and fishermen started defending Somali waters from European and Asian ships dumping toxic waste and illegally harvesting fish. With peak year 2010, statistics show a decline in attempts (152/62), hijackings (52/20), fatalities (15/6) and ransom paid ($44M/$8M). In April 2009</p>
<p>Costs of piracy in 2012 estimated up to $6.8B (security $2B, increased speed $1.5B, military $1B, insurance $551M, labor compensation $471M). Avoiding the Suez Canal means a major loss of income to Egypt and an extra 2,700 miles around the southern tip of Africa. </p>
<p><br />
<strong>How Should the World Face the Challenge of Somali Piracy? (Video 5.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>International cooperation (now including collective patrolling) is planned to include helping Somalia to rebuild infrastructure and economy, grant amnesty to pirates and utilize traditional clans. In 2013 poverty declined. Now piracy has become a problem around Nigerian waters.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The State of the State (Video 5.7)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Western states are under pressure mainly because of the growing Public debt/GDP (1960 60% - 2015 110%). Europe shows a relative high tax income and high public spending (both above 20%). Military spending is high in the US (4%) and low in Europe (1.5%).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Good Governance and Institutional Quality (Video 5.8)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Criticism includes the state.</p>
<p>Basic services include law &amp; order and national security. Discussion starts on economic management (fiscal &amp; monetary policy, international relationships, entrepreneurship). Most discussions are found regarding social welfare (education, healthcare, pensions, unemployment benefits, safety).</p>
<p>Emphasis is on good governance (political stability, policy predictability, rule of law, quality of regulations, transparency, no corruption, less red tape, protection of property rights).</p>
<p>The World Bank, Transparency International, Freedom House, Heritage Foundation, International Country Risk Guide, World Economic Forum, Fraser Institute issue rankings on countries. Singapore, North East Asia, USA and Western and Northern Europe often rank high. Low rankings  included China, Russia, Africa and Middle East.</p>
<p>Rankings provide a benchmark for policy makers (isomorphism). Since 2003, countries reduced time preparing and paying taxes, to start a business and cost to start a business.</p>

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_.236:_The_Quest_for_Sustainability">Week #6: The Quest for Sustainability</span></h1>
<p><br />
<em>Required reading</em>: <strong>Sustainability: New Perspectives and Opportunities, Global TrendLab</strong></p>
<p><br />
Sustainability has taken hold although progress has been limited, incremental and periodic. Topics include population dynamics, sustenance, energy and pollution. Solutions include rethinking values and behavior, supranational governance and self-adaptive policies based on trial and error.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Global Quest for Sustainability (Video 6.1)</strong> </p>
<hr />
<p>Definitions by Thomas Jefferson (1789) and Brundtland (1987) cover the debt towards future generations. Key drivers of sustainability are population growth, urbanization (1.5 mio growth a week), the rise of the middle class ($30Tr of new consumption in 20 years) and geopolitical problem areas. Quality of life, sustenance and future life are at stake.</p>
<p>Debate includes the kind of changes, the point of no return, merits of market-based and regulatory solutions and population and economic pressures. It’s about tradeoffs between short and long term enjoyment of life and economic growth. The levers include technological breakthroughs, incremental innovations and cultural norms.</p>
<p>Milestones include the 1972 Club of Rome’s Limits to Growth report and the US National Academy of Sciences report on greenhouse gasses, Bhopal gas leak (1984), Chernobyl nuclear explosion (1986), Exxon Valdez oil spill (1989) and Fukushima nuclear accident (2011).</p>
<p>The attention for sustainability declines during economic malaise and becomes salient after disasters but has become a cultural process like the Renaissance and Reformation.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Issues Regarding Energy (Video 6.2)</strong> </p>
<hr />
<p>Issues include renewability (wind versus oil), greenness (solar versus coal), carbon footprint (nuclear versus fossil fuels), reliability (coal versus wind), cost (coal versus solar), jobs involved, trade balance, national energy independency.</p>
<p>Total energy supply grew from 6B (1973) to 13B (2011) oil equivalent. The largest supplies come from oil (46/32%), Coal (25/29%), Gas (16/21%), nuclear (1/5%), and hydro (2/2%).</p>
<p>Electricity grew from 6TWh to 22THh. It is generated by coal (38/41%), gas (12/22%), hydro (21/16%), nuclear (3/12%), oil (25/5%) and green (1/5%).</p>
<p>Countries vary largely in producing, importing and exporting energy sources.</p>
<p>Average cost projections for 2018 in cents per KWh are gas (7), wind (9), hydro (9), coal (10), nuclear (11), solar (14) and wind offshore (22). This will shift trade balances. Wind power contribution is predicted to grow from 2 to 8%.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Carbon Emissions and Global Warming (Video 6.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Carbon emissions grew from 15,6Mtons (1973) to 31,3Mtons (2011). Contributors are OECD (66/39%), China (6/26%), Asia rest (3/11%), less developed Europe (16/9), Middle East (1/5%). OECD shifted towards cleaner sources where China uses mainly coal.</p>
<p>Europe leads decrease. US and China are shifting by using shale gas to replace coal (US) and incentives to decrease pollution (China).</p>
<p>CFC’s show an example of successful recovering of the ozone layer in 10 years. Scientific proof of damage was accepted and led to the Montreal Protocol in 1987. Subsequent solutions were found and didn’t require behavioral change nor involved economic damage (jobs).</p>
<p>There is little consensus about carbon emission.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The Case of Biomass in the Developing World (Video 6.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Around 2.7B people use cheap biomass and kills as much (most) women and children as malaria and tuberculosis and half as many as AIDS. It affects deforestation and carbon emission, with charcoal use on the increase. Charcoal can be linked to reforestation, using better production techniques and trading systems and improve stoves.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Are Subsidies for Green Energy the Solution? (Video 6.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Energy return to energy invested ratio’s are high on hydro energy (&gt;100:1) and lower on others (oil and gas 18:1; wind 18:1; nuclear 15:1; photovoltaic solar 7:1; shale oil 5:1) and even lower for other sources depending on production efficiency (sugarcane ethanol 1-10:1).</p>
<p>Subsidies should promote innovation and do not create perverse incentives and negative externalities. Fossil-fuel consumption is more subsidized around the world than other sources, due to Northern Africa, Middle East, Asia and Middle America as for political reasons (social stability).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Are Biofuels the Solution to the Energy Crisis? (Video 6.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Advantages of biofuels are: renewable; 90% lower carbon monoxide, job creation. Disadvantages are: crop displacement; upward pressure on food prices; decreased biodiversity; natural resources used for production.</p>
<p>Production amounts from 17B (2000) to 85B (2011) liters which are mainly produced by the US (62%; 10% of fuel) and Brazil (25%; 25% of fuel; 15M cars with flex motors).</p>
<p>Advantages of sugarcane ethanol over corn: 7 times higher energy return and competitive when oil prices are above $30 but below $80.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Food and Water (Video 6.7)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Urbanization removes people from the sources of food and water. Projections on food demand for 2010 and 2050 (1960 = 100) show 380 to 600 for met, 260 to 390 for dairy and 270 to 360 for cereals.</p>
<p>Most water is used for food production (70%). Agriculture is the largest sector in poor countries bur smallest in largest. This means that improved production can also save water. Only 10% is used for direct consumption and 20% is used for industrial use.</p>
<p>Today 900M people lack safe water. It is projected by the OECD that in 2030 50% (4B) will encounter serious water shortage, including China and India. Pressure on food production includes changing diet by the increased middle class (animal proteins) and subsequent need for agricultural land.</p>
<p>Food Price Index (1990-2005 = 100) increased due to US biofuel subsidies, trading, dollar weakness, export restrictions, the great depression (price collapse) and the Arab Spring to 175.</p>
<p>Agriculture is main cause of biodiversity loss.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Who Should do What in the Quest for Sustainability? (Video 6.9)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Solutions to improve sustainability include the development of new sources of energy, produce food more efficiently and make better use of water available.</p>
<p>Companies have the largest structural power and can overcome the effect of profit by evoking innovation. Governments can encourage by regulations and incentives (see CFC example).</p>
<p>Consumers are concerned but do not want to pay more. Positive examples include lighting and organic foods. Furthermore the relationship between consumption and happiness can be redefined.</p>
<p>Nonprofits and NGO’s can play a role by gathering and diffuse information and support a cultural change.</p>
<p>Governments can address future interests, balance regulation and markets, provide incentives for innovation, use sanctions, help to maintain jobs and promote collective global governance.</p>

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_.237:_Global_Powers_of_the_21th_Century">Week #7: Global Powers of the 21th Century</span></h1>
<p><br />
<strong>The Concept of Global Power (Video 7.1)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Global Powers have the ability to influence affairs on global scale. Its power is derived from: economic strength; military might; diplomatic capabilities; soft resources.</p>
<p>Great powers (empires) are complex systems with a large number of interacting components, asymmetrically organized, in fragile equilibrium, constantly adapting and when going into critical change, the outcome difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Examples of “collapsed” great powers are Rome (5thC), Aztecs (16thC), Ming China (17thC), Spain (16thC), France (18thC), Great Brittan (20thC), Russia/USSR/Modern Russia (20/21thC).</p>
<p>Global powers emerged in the 20th Century and always have been part of coalitions.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Let’s do the numbers (Video 7.2)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Largest population: India, China (1520) and India (2030).</p>
<p>Largest economy: India, China (1500), Western Europe (1840), US (1942) and China (2020).</p>
<p>US is assumed to stay the richest country during the 21th Century. No consideration is taken to what happens when global power shifts towards China, India and EU. What if US$ stops to be the global trade currency?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Power resources (Video 7.3)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Hard powers: territory, population, economy, finance and military power.</p>
<p>Soft power: knowledge (Universities, R&amp;D, Patents, Royalties), technology and culture.</p>
<p>Current major (fragile) differences between global powers are: US has global military power but seems financial bankrupt, China lacks technologies, Russia has a weak economy and relatively a small population.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>China as a Global Power (Video 7.4)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>China’s strength: largest population, economy, trading power, surplus current account and foreign reserves and investments.</p>
<p>China’s weaknesses: growth of cities, population ageing, gender imbalance, environmental degradation, rising production cost, fragile banking systems, transition to consumer economy, currency convertibility, rampant corruption, income inequality, political legitimacy, ethnic strife, territorial conflicts.</p>
<p>Currently China and US dominate talks on global trade, financial architecture and climate change. US and Russia dominate localized conflicts (Syria).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Global Governance (Video 7.5)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Since 1975 the largest economies held extending G-summits. In 1999 the G-20 was held, which is considered small in terms of global interests but large in terms of decision-making. Main influence is expected to come from US, China, India, EU and Russia.</p>
<p>No single power can impose its will.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Global Tensions (Video 7.6)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Tensions involve socio-demographic (ageing, centers of growth, cities, inequality), economic (emerging economies, trade &amp; financial imbalances), geo-political (shifts, failed states, terrorism) and political tensions (fiscal, legitimacy, disillusionment with democracy, anocracies).</p>
<p>The implications are political unrest, race for natural resources, geopolitical frictions, skills gap, inequality, diminished state capacity to act, global governance problem, social unrest and political protests.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>What Kind of World Should we Expect (Video 7.7)</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Complexity (multi-polar, unanticipated interactions), tight coupling (little room for error) and uncertainty (systemic disruption) are three characteristics of the new world.</p>
