<ul>
<li>Hello, in this mini-lecture we're going to continue our discussion of major depression. We're going to talk about pathophysiology, what actually causes major depression. We're going to talk about animal models, particularly in mice, and we're not going to talk about bio-markers, because there really is no one or two established bio-markers that tell us when a person or an animal is suffering from major depression.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Brain Areas that Regulate Mood</strong><br />
<ul><li> Let's first of all review the brain areas that regulate mood. Clearly, there are problems with these brain areas in the mood disorders. So, the neural circuitry of mood consists of a number of areas in the ventral brain, and also some areas in the forebrain, most probably the frontal cortex.<br />
</li><li> The frontal cortex consists of both the prefrontal and the cingulate cortex, and as you'll remember, deep brain stimulation in the anterior cingulate cortex is an emerging therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The frontal cortex, covering the cognitive function, and the attention, and these clearly are functions that, are disregulated in major depression.<br />
</li><li> The ventral region of the hippocampus also governs cognitive function in memory, also thought to be disrupted in major depression.<br />
</li><li> The nucleus accumbens, or the ventral striatum, governs reward and via projections, do it from other areas, probably also aversion.<br />
</li><li> The amygdala has been studied very aggressively over the past decade or so, and mediates responses to emotional stimuli, including fear.<br />
</li><li> The hypothalamus regulates a number of important functions in the body, sleep, appetite, energy, sex, and it participates also in the so called hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. And this axis involves both the brain and the periphery, and involves several hormones and transmitters that are thought to be disregulated during depression.<br />
</li><li> The ventral tegmental area projects via this blue arrow here to the nucleus accumbens and also as we've learned, to several other brain areas.<br />
</li><li> The dorsal Raphe is the place where most serotonergic neurons in the brain are localized, and we'll see in the next couple of lectures that this plays an important role in the action of SSRI's.<br />
</li><li> The locus coeruleus, mostly noradrenergic cells, cells that make noradrenaline also send input to other areas, and we'll see that SNRIs might be working here. So lots of brain areas regulate mood.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; In addition to SERT effects, other deficits in serotonin systems cause psychiatric symptoms</strong>
<ul><li> Now, in addition to effects on the serotonin transporter there are other deficits in serotonin systems that cause psychiatric symptoms. There are probably actually four separate serotonin systems, in the periphery and in the central nervous system, in the gut, that take up and or release serotonin. For instance tryptophan hydroxylase knockout mice can't make serotonin, and they have marked deficits in social behavior.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Another obvious and important fact is that it's been known since the 1960s that roughly 30 percent of autism cases have abnormally high circulating serotonin. What this tells us about pathophysiology in general and specifically about the pathophysiology of depression is not clearly understood.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Animal (especially mouse) Models for Depression</strong>
<ul><li> There are several established animal models for depression, mostly mice, because they can be bred rapidly and housed in large numbers. They are used both in drug companies and in academic laboratories, not in my laboratory.<br />
</li><li> The first is the forced swim test. One places an animal in water. The animal swims for a while, then it simply floats. Antidepressants delay the time till floating.<br />
</li><li> The tail suspension assay, the experimenter holds the animal by the tail. The animal struggles for a while, then stops struggling. Antidepressants delay the time till the animal stops struggling.<br />
</li><li> Learned helplessness, the experimenter subjects the animal to mild foot shock. The animal tries to escape, but the cage does not let the animal to escape. After a while, the animal stops trying to escape, and antidepressants delay the time till the animal stops struggling.<br />
</li><li> Chronic unpredictable stress also turned mild chronic stress, is a paradigm in which the animal is subjected to low and unpredictable to him, levels of stress for relatively long periods of time, weeks or even months. And, animals are studied as they develop symptoms of depression toward the end of this regime.<br />
</li><li> And finally, there's the social defeat paradigm, in which one stresses the animal by exposing him or her to highly aggressive, dominant males. The animal retreats to a corner and attempts to avoid contact, and antidepressants change that behavior.<br />
</li><li> So, where do we stand with regard to the validity of these animal models? Well. This wonderful quote from Nestler, et al., gives us two catch-22s. First, they say yes, all clinical validated anti-depressants are active in these tests, but actually, the tests were designed to validate compounds, and only compounds that are active in the test are pursued as antidepressants for human use.<br />
</li><li> Another catch-22 is that other compounds that do not act on monoamines have produced antidepressant-like activity. In these tests, but they have not been validated clinically in people. So that's the second of the catch 22's. So, it could be stated, that the field of animal models for depression and for developing anti-depressants is in a state of some uncertainty at the moment.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout mice</strong>
<ul><li> It is clear, however, that mice have been useful to the extent that we can look at knockouts, elimination of the serotonin transporter. It is very clear that serotonin transporter knockout mice have altered behavior and drug responses, and the people who write about these data and who produce these data are cautious to say that these suggest that serotonin, and in particular, the serotonin transporter, modulate complex behavior. They modulate actions of therapeutic agents and of drugs of abuse, and they modulate pathophysiology of psychiatric, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, all of which been, have which been detected or modified in certain knockout mice.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>This is a peculiar phrase that I want to emphasize. Serotonin, and in particular, the serotonin transporter, modulate these behaviors, as though one is suggesting that the serotonin transporter modulates these behaviors in ways that are unrelated to the nearby serotonin concentration, which they manipulate. Well, that's a curious phrase. We'll get back to it.  </p></li>
<li><p>In addition to the serotonin effects, there are other deficits in serotonin systems that cause psychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan hydrolase knockouts can't make serotonin. So these are mice, and they have deficits in social behavior, and scientists have known since the 1960's that roughly 30% of autism cases have abnormally high circulating serotonin. Now, how that intersects with depression and with antidepressant mechanisms is clearly not yet understood. So, we have a few puzzles, many puzzles about the pathophysiology of major depression, and we'll turn to what we can learn from drugs in the next couple of mini lectures.</p></li>
