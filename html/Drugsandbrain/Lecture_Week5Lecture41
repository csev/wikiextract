<ul>
<li>Hello. We're going to talk about several aspects of a major depressive disorder in this lecture. It's also called unipolar depressive disorder to distinguish major depressive disorder from bipolar disorder. We'll use the terms major depressive and unipolar depressive disorder interchangeably. In this mini lecture, we're going to concentrate on the clinical description and the genetics.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Major Depressive Disorder in DSM-IV</strong>
<ul><li> DSM IV <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders">{Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition}</a> describes essential features of a major depressive episode as a period of at least two weeks in which there's either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. Anhedonia is another word for this, meaning loss of pleasure. In children,  adolescents, and some adults the mood may be irritable rather than sad and we'll get to that toward the end of this slide. The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms from a list such as changes in appetite or weight or sleep or psychomotor activity, generally decreased energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, thinking or making decisions or even recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation plans or attempts.<br />
</li><li> Now, to count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must have clearly worsened. For instance, Eeyore, has no major depressive episode, that's just Eeyore and he's like this all the time. The symptoms during a major depressive episode must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two consecutive weeks.<br />
</li><li> Now, major depressive disorder is characteristic of untreated episodes of major depression that last from seven to fourteen months. This is a very rough estimate. Some episodes are much briefer. Major depression is indeed a recurring disorder, and it usually worsens with age, if it's not treated. And the reported incidence of depression is three times higher in women than in men. And so you notice that the DALY graph in the previous lecture spiked much higher for women for major depression than for other psychiatric diseases. It would be less high for men, but I do want to caution you that men seem to manifest depression or something like it, as irritability more than women do. We need to keep this balance among the various symptoms of depression in mind when we analyze men versus women.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Major Depression is Often Treatable</strong>
<ul><li> You know, a very important point to emphasize with your friends is that major depression is often treatable. There are somatic treatments:  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Medications which we will emphasis here.  </li>
<li>Vagal nerve stimulation is used fairly often these days.  </li>
<li>Deep brain stimulation in the anterior cingulate cortex. We won't be able to return to this topic. I did discuss deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, and deep brain stimulation in the anterior cingulate cortex seems to have definite benefits for some patients. We don't quite understand how it works.  </li>
<li>And then there is electro-convulsive therapy, and we'll discuss this when we talk about bipolar disorder.  </li>
<li>Psychotherapy can also be effective for major depression. Two types of psychotherapy are cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy. Some people believe that psychotherapy is most effective when it's combined with medications, or with other somatic treatments. And of course depressed people often find that diet and exercise help them to deal with their depression as well.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; 2.  Genetics</strong><br />
<ul><li> Now the genetics of major depression often starts at least in my mind, with Tolstoy's famous first sentence of Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike, each unhappy family has its own story.” And in this case, we might say that each unhappy family has its own particular genetic makeup.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Major depressive disorder is several times more common on first degree biological relatives of persons with this disorder than among the general population, but it is so heterogeneous that very few scientists have tried or succeeded at genome-wide association scans you remember we discussed GWAS in connection to nicotine addiction in mini lecture thirty. So instead candidate genes are being pursued and I will spend a few minutes talking about the most famous and best understood candidate gene, which is the serotonin transporter.   </p></li>
<li><p>There's also evidence for an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders in adult first degree biological relatives of depressed patients, and this includes alcohol dependence. And there may be an increased incidence of attention deficit hyper activity disorder in the children of adults with this disorder. But these reports require detailed replication.  </p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Serotonin transporter (SERT) mutations are linked to</strong><br />
<ul><li> Now the serotonin transporter has been discussed as a molecule and as a drug target in mini lectures 22 and 23 and there is no doubt that since the early 1990s mutations of the serotonin transporter has been linked to many psychiatric indications.<br />
</li><li> First of all to personality traits, among the early reports was a linkage between polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter and anxiety neuroticism (negative emotionality). More recently, fMRI which we had discussed previously, has been used to show that blood flow in the amygdala changes. And these changes may be correlated with polymorphisms in this serotonin transporter.<br />
</li><li> Here is a diagram of the serotonin transporter gene in humans. This is the DNA, not the protein, and from the five prime end where transcription and translation start to the three prime end. The coding region is shown here as a salmon-colored box, and this has fourteen exons separated by as many introns. The regions of the gene that actually produce the amino acids that make up the final protein.<br />
</li><li> There are a couple of well-studied polymorphisms that actually change the nature of an amino acid side chain from one to another. Probably the most famous is at position 425 where the majority of the time the amino acid is an isoleucine; there are several other amino acids that can take its place. And these very rare polymorphisms are associated with highly penetrant,  that is quite likely cases of autism as well as obsessive compulsive disorder. There's another not quite so well-studied polymorphism that changes a glycine at position 56 to an alanine. </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>In the introns in the coding region, is one place where there is quite a bit of variability. It is a tandem repeat, over and over again, in the RNA. Ultimately this will get spliced out, and this, also, has been associated with some psychiatric indications.  </p></li>
<li><p>The RNA has some regions that come before the start of protein synthesis and these are subject to alternative splicing. You remember that we talked about splicing of RNA of which introns were removed, exons are placed in, even though these will not result in a coding region, they still bind to the ribosomes.  </p></li>
<li><p>And then further up in a polymorphic region which may be the promoter for the gene, there are SNPs <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism">{single-nucleotide polymorphism}</a>. And this region is called a serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region and variations in this region have been associated with a number of these diseases.  </p></li>
<li><p>So the serotonin transporter is a very well studied gene among humans. Some of these polymorphisms are present, some of these regions are present only in humans. And so it has been a real challenge to generate mouse models for these polymorphisms and to understand the biology and the consequences of drugs that bind to the transporter and how these variations in the transporter actually lead to variations in human behavior. Next time, we'll talk about additional aspects of unipolar depression, major depression.</p></li>
