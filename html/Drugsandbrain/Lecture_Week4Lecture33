<ul>
<li>Now we're going to talk about what causes the pathology in Alzheimer's Disease. It's not clearly known, but we certainly have some major hints. We begin with the protein called &#946;APP, or beta amyloid precursor protein.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Pathophysiology. Aβ40 and Aβ42 are proteolytic products formed from APP</strong><br />
<ul><li> The APP proteins are a family that are 110 to 140 kilodaltons in molecular mass. They are in fact expressed by most tissues, especially by neurons. They reach the axon terminals and the dendrites. They're also found in some glial cells. They have a large extracellular domain; a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic side. And the pathological part of APP is thought to be a set of smaller peptides called A&#946;. That are released from the full-length APP by proteolytic cleavage. So, there are three proteolytic cleavage sites, &#945;, &#946; and &#947;.<br />
</li><li> You can see that the A&#946; peptide encompasses partially a membrane spanning domain, and partially an extra cellular domain. An overproduction of A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 depending on the length (These are the lengths of the peptides) result from specific ratio of proteolytic cleavages. That is of cleavages of the protein, at the &#945;, &#946; and &#947; [sites]. Here are the sites of some mutations causing familial Alzheimer disease: Just past the &#946; cleavage site; just past the &#947; cleavage site.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; All known genetic risk factors predisposing to Alzheimer’s disease</strong><br />
<ul><li> In fact, all of the known genetic risk factors that predispose a person to Alzheimer's Disease, increase the accumulation of A&#946; peptides. And so on chromosome 21 which is where &#946;APP lives as a gene, there are mutations as we've seen in A&#946; itself. We have also talked about the ApoE4 polymorphism. Specifically the &#949;four allele, which increases the density of A&#946; plaques and vascular deposits. There are a couple of mutations in presenilins. There are two presenilin proteins, one and two, and they too increase the production of A&#946; peptides. And finally, some more recently discovered genes such as TREM2 also increase the density of A&#946; and of A&#946; plaques. And so, we have the amyloid hypothesis, meaning amyloid precursor protein, as a cause of Alzheimer's Disease.   </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>And a recent review reminds us that the precise meaning of the amyloid hypothesis has changed over the years, and it differs among scientists. Originally it was thought that the actual amyloid is pathogenic. More modern versions of this hypothesis actually state that A&#946; and microaggregates of the A&#946;, not the plaques themselves, not the amyloid plaques are the pathogenic agents and so you could call them A&#946; derived diffusible ligands if you like.   </p></li>
<li><p>We should also point out, or we talked about tau in the last lecture, abnormal states of tau also mediate some effects of beta amyloid.
And so a lot of the effects of beta amyloid may come about because it makes tau accumulate or phosphorylates tau. On the other hand this stage of tau pathology may be distal to downstream from the more toxic A&#946; dimers and oligomers.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; There are no convincing data suggesting the presence of a single “Aβ receptor”</strong><br />
<ul><li> When we start talking about A&#946; derived diffusible ligands, we have to ask the question, is there actually a single A&#946; receptor the way there are single receptors for many other drugs in the nervous system? And there are really no convincing data that so far suggested the presence of a single A&#946; receptor. If there were one, our job would be a lot easier to understand the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.<br />
</li><li> So instead the scientists had been thinking about soluble oligomers. An oligomer is an assembly of four to 40 peptides. All the same, all multiple copies of A&#946;42. They're soluble, they don't precipitate. They interact with other proteins and then with other proteins they precipitate to form the amyloid plaques. And, indeed soluble oligomers of A&#946; are toxic to neurons. Unfortunately, we don't know precisely how they are toxic. The 12-mer may be the most significant toxic form, but this is not very well known. And to make things more complicated, we need to talk about the concept of cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous diseases.<br />
</li><li>  A cell autonomous disease is one in which a cell with a mutant gene itself gets damaged and this is the cause of the disease or the cause of an animals change due to a mutation. In a non-cell autonomous disease or mutation the effect of a mutation in one cell is spread to another cell or downstream. Now, you can say, wait a minute, all the cells in an organism have the same genes and that's true but there are ways of putting a cell with a specific mutated gene in an organism, in an otherwise wild type organism or other ways of making an insult in one cell and asking whether it's the cause of the phenotype.<br />
</li><li> So, the usual assumption is that A&#946;42 toxicity is a cell autonomous process. The cell that has a bad A&#946;42 dies and that's all but in fact, misfolded A&#946;42 may spread from one cell to another. And here the example are prion diseases, in which a misfolded conformation of a prion gets spread from one cell to another and causes disease. We don't know how important this prion-like quality of A&#946; 42 is. We'll talk about it again, when we talk about Synuclein which may also be a prion causing Parkinson's Disease.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Normal function of presenilin’s &#947;-secretase activity:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>So, what is it about the cleavage of APP and the action of presenilin and its &#947;-secretase activity that is so important? Indeed what is the function of APP in the first place. What is the function of this protein who's cleavage makes A&#946;40 and A&#946;42?   </li>
<li>Well, we don't know the selective advantage of APP in an organism. We do however know that there is another substrate, another protein which can get cleaved by &#947;-secretase. So, here is the &#947;secretase complex. It contains presenilin, the enzyme in it. Here is one author's view of the entire core secretase conplex containing several subunits, one of the presenilins and a couple of other proteins
with interesting names. And so, what is the function of this &#947;-secretase complex in the first place?  </li>
<li>Well, the function, the selective advantage of having this complex, may be an entirely different substrate. It may be the Notch protein, whose cleavage is so important for developmental processes. And so, some hypotheses then are that the presenilins are adventitiously or epiphenomicallogically cleaving APP but that's not their real function. The real function is in signaling like the Notch pathway. Stay tuned for this.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; General Cellular Processes that could Account for aβ pathology</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>So in terms of pathology one could think about two types of pathology.  </li>
<li><p>The first is general cellular processes that could account for A&#946; pathology. For instance protein homeostasis and turnover. Homeostasis
means trying to keep things constant. And in this topic we know that accumulation of erroneous misfolded or partially processed proteins continues as a major theme in  neurodegenerative disease. So the accumulation of partially processed proteins in a neuron may be toxic. In particular when proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum on their way to secretion, but blocked from secretion. This causes a phenomenon called endoplasmic reticulum stress, or ER stress which results in a complex set of metabolic processes termed the unfolded protein response. And an unchecked unfolded protein response can eventually cause cell death. So this is a way that erroneous, misfolded, partially processed proteins, such as the complexes between A&#946; and other proteins could lead to the death of neurons.  </p></li>
<li><p>Another very general cellular process is that it might be that the A&#946; causes excessive ion fluxes which lead to a phenomenon
called excitotoxicity. This would overwhelm the cell's ability to maintain ion gradients via ion-coupled transporters. Various metabolites would
accumulate in wrong compartments, extracellular, the cytosol or an organelle. And when calcium accumulates to too great an extent in the cytosol and organelles, this activates transduction systems, overactivates enzymes, and generally leads to cell death. So, these are general cellular processes that could account for A&#946; pathology.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Pathogenic hypotheses for mostly synaptic toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Now, as opposed to the general cellular processes, we could think specifically about synaptic processes that cause Alzheimer's pathology. And we over the past few decades, neural scientists have learned so much about the function of synapses. And so much quantitative about how much
transmitter is released and for how long and how long it lasts. We have lots of good data about normal synaptic transmission. And so, the hypothesis has been arisen and got some, some support that in fact, either loss of synapses or subtle changes in synapses could cause the cognitive defects associated with Alzheimer's.  </li>
<li>It certainly is true that in anatomical studies frank loss of synapses correlates better with the cognitive deficits, and these are postmortem
studies, than do plaques or tangles. But even more subtle than that, is the question of whether abnormal, too little or too much, synaptic transmission could cause the cognitive deficits in Alzheimers. And so here are some possible scenarios by which, soluble oligomers from A&#946; or plaque resulting from A&#946; or impaired presenilin function, or calcium disregulation could lead to altered synaptic function. So, we will
have to stay tuned for these specific hypotheses too.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Specific example of synaptic malfunction</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Now we are going to talk about a specific example of synaptic malfunction that might be associated with A&#946; peptides. It's an interesting story because it will be familiar to many neuroscientists. It involves long term potentiation which we abbreviate LTP. It involves slices from the hippocampus of a rat and we've discussed the hippocampus in  a previous lecture. The hippocampus is important in memory and learning and it's
one of the brain regions that degenerates in human in Alzheimer's disease.  </li>
<li>So the top panel involves recording from cells in the hippocampus, extracellular recording in EPSP amplitudes, excitatory postsynaptic potentials. At this point here we give a tetanic pulse, a high frequency pulse to the preparation. In the normal situation, the EPSP activates and stays increased for a couple of hours.  </li>
<li>But if the medium surrounding the hippocampus slice contains A&#946; oligomers, then the elevated EPSP is not sustained but it goes away after half an hour or so. The A&#946; oligomers can't be synthesized chemically, so instead they are synthesized in a cell line that is engineered to express A&#946;.   </li>
<li>Now, an example of the kind of control that one has to do an experiment like this is to use an antibody against A&#946;. And so, if we do the same experiment or the experimenter Walsh et al. do the same experiment, but now with an antibody to A&#946;, they see no decrease in the EPSP. Showing that in fact it was the A&#946; from the conditioned medium that was the important drug. And now if we use an antibody against another molecule, a sort of controlled non-specific antibody then the A&#946; oligomers survive. And the trace here, the green trace looks like the
blue trace up here with the A&#946; oligomers. So this is a nice elegant experiment of the several available in the literature that point to specific malfunctions in synaptic transmission; specific malfunctions that point to an inability of synapses to retain information for long periods of time, and that is of course part of cognition.  </li>
<li>So, I've talked to you about the possible causes of Alzheimer's disease. We've talked about general cellular mechanisms for A&#946; toxicity. We've talked about specific synaptic mechanisms for A&#946; and next time we'll talk about models and possible therapies for Alzheimer's.</li>
