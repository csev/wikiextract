<p>Hello. It's a late fall weekend morning on the Cal Tech campus in Pasadena. We're looking toward the northeast at scenes that may be familiar to viewers of Numb3rs. Now we're looking toward the north at the Kirchoff building these arcades and cloisters figured in several Numb3rs scenes. We're moving towards the west now looking at the Bechtel mall and then we'll move toward the south and begin telling you about the synapse as a drug sensitive biophysical machine.  </p>
<p><strong>Life Cycle of a Synaptic Vesicle in a Presynaptic Terminal</strong><br />
<ul><li> Just reminding you that in the presynaptic terminal we have vesicles full of transmitter, some of them docked to the membrane awaiting calcium flux which allows them to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and liberate their contents of transmitter into the synaptic cleft. Here in this electron micrograph we see a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic cell, and we imagine that all of the action is taking place here in this 500 angstrom gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Timing of synaptic events</strong><br />
<ul><li> In favorable cases, we can actually record simultaneously, from the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. For instance, in the squid giant synapse and so here is a presynaptic and postsynaptic recording, rather stylized. We have the usual action potential, and then the after hyperpolarization, and then the postsynaptic recording. If we did not have a postsynaptic spike, we would have the excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP) which would reach threshold for a post synaptic impulse, and fire a spike.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Back in the presynaptic terminal we have the inward calcium current which is responsible for transmitter release. Now the whole synaptic delay between the peak of the action potential and the start of transmitter release is about half a millisecond. And actually the delay between the peak of the calcium current in the beginning of the EPSP is only about 0.2 milliseconds, a bit more at lower temperature and so most of the synaptic delay is caused in the opening of calcium channels during the presynaptic action potential. And the size and timing of the EPSPs can be modulated by changing the waveform of the presynaptic action potential and several drugs change transmitter release in this way.  </p></li>
<li><p>For instance Ziconitide blocks these calcium channels. Ziconitide is a relatively new pain killer, its one of the few peptide drugs that work in the brain and it needs to be introduced in the brain with an intrathecal pump (that is inside the spinal cord).  </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ligand-Gated Ion Channels</strong><br />
<ul><li> Moving onto ligand-gated channels. We're going talk about the timing of their activation today. Reminding you that they are multmeric integral membrane proteins and that ion flux through these channels can send a signal in two ways:  change in the membrane voltage or calcium entry. This is critical for transmitter release, for synaptic plasticity, and for several other roles. Indeed calcium is a very common universal transmitter in the nervous system. Cells typically maintain their calcium concentrations quite low  and this allows them to use transient, localized calcium entry, as a signaling mechanism.</p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The channel opens within just a few microseconds after binding a ligand. There are two types of ion selectivity in ligand-gated ion channels. There is cationic selectivity, and as we'll see, this is often non-selective for sodium, for potassium, and sometimes for calcium as well. And then there are anionic post-synaptic receptors which flux chloride at GABAA and glycine receptors and these proteins are subject to modulation in various ways.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Superfamilies of Vertebrate Ligand-gated Ion Channels / Synaptic Receptors</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Iâ€™ll remind you that there are three super families of ligand-gated ion channels which are synaptic receptors in this mini lecture and then the next one we will discuss primarily the pentameric Cys-loop receptors. These are the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, the GABAA and the glycine receptors. Here is a single subunit of one of these receptors. It has four transmembrane domains. Later on we will discuss postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Unfortunately, we won't have time to discuss the ATP receptors, also called P2X receptors.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timing / Analysis of Postsynaptic Activation</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Now, let's talk in detail, about the timing in the analysis of postsynaptic activation. Here we imagine that we are doing a single channel recording, from a postsynaptic memory. Single channel recordings are done with patch clamps, and, here at the base line the channel is closed. We have one channel in the patch, and we have some agonists, some acetylcholine or some glutamate depending on which channel we're monitoring. And every once in a while that channel opens, it stays open for a while and then closes. Here it opens again and stays open for a while, and then closes.  </p></li>
<li><p>What we're going to is to analyze the timing, by synchronizing artificially on the opening event. This can easily be done with software, sometimes with a bit of hardware. And so we take this final event and we line it up with the beginning of the opening. And then we do the same thing for one of the other events, etc, until we have all the channels retrospectively synchronized as they open together. And now we superimpose them so that they are nearly all synchronized, and we see although we have made them all begin at nearly the same time, they are closing at different times. They have a stochastic closing event.  </p></li>
<li><p>And the importance of this phenomenon is that although we did this recording by taking a single channel and recording it for several minutes at a time. During a synaptic event, actually there are many channels in parallel in the membrane, the neurotransmitter hits them nearly all at once, and so we get a macroscopic recording which seems to be the sum of these single channel openings. So at a synapse, the pulse of transmitter is approximately a {Dirac] delta function, for those of you familiar with that, and all post-synaptic channels open nearly synchronously. And several drugs perturb either the synchrony or the duration of these openings. And we'll discuss them primarily, in a future mini-lecture when we discuss the GABA receptors.</p></li>
