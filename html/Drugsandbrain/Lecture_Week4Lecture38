<ul>
<li>We're going to discuss now the very challenging but very important topic of protection against Parkinson's disease. The idea here is that if one could diagnose Parkinson's disease rather early on one would be able to apply a treatment. And we'll discuss the various treatments from that day forth and the patient would show no further neurodegeneration and the mild neurodegeneration that had occurred up until then would be no hindrance to continued productive life.  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Does deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease delay degeneration?</strong><br />
<ul><li> First let's give the bad news, or at least the inconclusive news about the topic that we just discussed, deep brain stimulation. And we'll raise the question, does deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease delay neurodegeneration at all. The data are unclear, both in humans and in animal models people are continuing to pursue the hypothesis that the brain stimulation might arrest neurodegeneration. But for the moment we just don't know.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Inverse correlation between a person’s history of tobacco use &amp; susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease</strong><br />
<ul><li> So now let’s go on to this very interesting question of whether there is a drug that one might give to delay neurodegeneration from the time that Parkinson's is first diagnosed. And here we come upon a epidemiological fact that has been known for about 55 years. It is the inverse correlation between a person's history of tobacco use and his susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. In brief, that means that people who smoke have less of a risk of Parkinson's disease.<br />
</li><li> Now, this is strange there are at least 50 retrospective epidemiological studies on this point and this graph is a so called tree graph, a meta analysis of about 45 of these studies dating from 2002, the horizontal line would signify that a person who uses tobacco has about the same risk of Parkinson's disease as a person who does not use tobacco. And so, anything below the, that horizontal line means the person who uses tobacco has a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease. These individual markers here are all individual studies in the biomedical literature. These are case versus control studies in which a person is matched with the control person. These are cohort studies studying large numbers of people who smoke and who do not smoke. Both the case and the cohort studies indicate that a history of tobacco use is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's Disease, and if we average all of the studies, it's pretty clear that the odd's ratio is much less than 1.0 it's around 0.5. That is a person who has used tobacco is about half as likely as a non user to develop Parkinson's disease. In some cases, this risk goes back twenty years before the development of Parkinson's disease, that is one can see a protective effect even if the person smoked twenty years ago.<br />
</li><li> So the first question that one asks is whether there is a genetic difference among the patients and the controls. And Tanner in 2002 studied identical twins who were discordant, that is one had Parkinson's disease, one did not. And they included at least one smoker, these identical twins. The twins without Parkinson's disease smoked more than their brothers smoked these were male twins an average of 37.1 versus 25.3 pack years. A pack year is smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for one year. So if a person smokes two packs of cigarettes per year, that's two pack years etcetera. This did not quite reach the level of statistical significance, so for the moment we have to say that the question of shared genes or different genes, making the difference between susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, is not yet completely resolved. But it certainly looks probable that genetics plays only a small role.</p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; Tobacco use protects against PD, vs PD patients use less tobacco</strong><br />
<ul><li> So, what could be going on here? Well, there are two major hypothesis categories. The first is that tobacco use protects against Parkinson's disease that would be causality. But remember that we are dealing here with retrospective clinical studies, and so there's another hypothesis that in their early stages, Parkinson's patients simply use less tobacco.<br />
</li><li> Now, this is not an unreasonable hypothesis because you remember the handlebar mustache, we have the substantia nigra neurons which control mo vement and degenerate in Parkinson's. We have the neighboring VTA neurons which control a feeling of well-being with tobacco, with nicotine. And, although we have been stating that these neurons control movement and these control pleasure, there's actually a bit of a mixture. And so, if a person's substantia nigra has degenerated to the point where he gets a little bit less pleasure from tobacco. Then he may be more able to quit smoking. So we have to keep that so-called inverse causality possibility, in mind.<br />
</li><li> Let's look further. Well, we have to say that nicotine itself is probably part of smoking's apparent neuro protective action. We say apparent because there's always this possibility of inverse causality, and as usual, one turns to animal models. And in monkeys and in rodents, nicotine appears to protect dopaminergic neurons against toxins. My friend Marika Quik has several important papers on that topic. Also a pioneering paper on mice, who had a knockout for the &#945;nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit, the one we've discussed in the context, in the context of smoking, seem to lack the protection afforded by nicotine.<br />
</li><li> When one challenges dopaminergic neurons. I want you to also add that the inverse correlation does not simply concern smoking, but there's a very strong inverse correlation for chewing tobacco again in epidemiological studies. One has to remember, however, that chewing tobacco has been smoke cured, and so the toxins that, and the carcinogens that remain in smoked tobacco also remain in smoke cured tobacco.<br />
</li><li> And one theory about the protective effect of smoking is that the smoke builds up detoxifying enzymes. For instance, in a person's liver and that those enzymes therefore do a better job in breaking down toxins that might cause damage to dopaminergic neurons such as the pesticides we discussed in a previous lecture. So the fact that chewing tobacco, shows the inverse correlation is not quite proof. What do we need?<br />
</li><li> Well we certainly do need additional human data. For instance, Parkinson's disease among Swedish snus users, as we've discussed. Snus largely, but not completely, eliminates the toxic effect of smoking, so it would be very interesting to have data for Swedish Snus users. Unfortunately, my friends who study epidemiological data in Sweden, tell me that there may not be enough snus users in Parkinson's patients in Sweden, to give statistically meaningful results. And that, of course raises the question do we simply use nicotine patches to protect against Parkinson's disease?<br />
</li><li> Well, there is indeed a clinical trial underway for early stage Parkinson's patients who are given nicotine patches. We hope that, that trial will have sufficient statistical power and the correct dosage to give a good result one way or the other. We have to say though that nicotine patches may not be an ideal treatment because nicotine itself is a perfect addictive drug. But it is a sub-optimal therapeutic drug. It becomes eliminated rather rapidly within an hour or two by the liver. And also, nicotine itself activates several nicotinic receptors, in addition to the presumed nicotinic receptors in the Substantia Nigra that would be the target of the protective effect. Many people cannot tolerate patches.<br />
</li><li> One should take the long view and say that nicotine has come up as a possible neuro protective drug in Parkinson's disease. Not because it's the best drug but, because so many people smoke, so many people use smoked tobacco that one can get excellent statistics for smokers. And indeed, there are analogist data for caffeine users as well. Caffeine users appear to have a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease. So, going back to the apparent neuro protective effect of nicotine what is the mechanism?  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt; What is the Mechanism: for Nicotine’s apparent neuroprotective effect?</strong><br />
<ul><li> Going back to our lectures on nicotine addiction, is it an outside-in mechanism or an inside-out mechanism? Well first of all, why does it matter to anybody but a few molecular pharmacologists? Well, there are some clear differences in the implications of these two mechanisms.<br />
</li><li> First, inside-out mechanisms occur at steady low concentrations of nicotine, not the short, sharp concentrations that one get's from smoking. So, dosing would be quite different for neuroprotection. In outside-in, versus inside-out mechanisms. Second, several drug companies, who've noticed this inverse correlation, have active programs to discover analogs and derivatives of nicotine, with better drug characteristics.<br />
</li><li> Well, how should one screen using high throughput screening in animal models for these drugs? Should one use outside-in electrical assays of channels opening and closing? Patch clamps and voltage clamps and the kind of things that we learned about in the first two weeks? Or should one use inside-out chaperoning assays of this sort that we learned in the third week of this course. Well, you have to know whether it's outside in or inside out.<br />
</li><li> Furthermore, an inside-out mechanism would involve many additional molecular targets. For instance, in the endoplasmic reticulum in the, the Golgi apparatus. So, we really do need to know the difference. I have to say that outside-in mechanisms seem unlikely, because outside-in mechanisms lead through the calcium permeability of nicotinic receptors. To elevated intracellular calcium, and there is an important literature developing now that intracellular calcium tends to kill dopaminergic neurons.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt;Inside-out and upregulation-based mechanisms</strong><br />
<ul><li> So my lab has been pursuing for the last few years the mechanisms of neuroprotection and we've written a review recently and most of the data that we generate seem to indicate an inside-out or up regulation based mechanism. In fact, there are three likely mechanisms. The first of them is circuit based and this involves the cell's selective upregulation of &#945;4&#946;2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.<br />
</li><li> Now this is a bit more realistic circuit diagram of the basal ganglia and the midbrain then the ones I previously showed you and these codes tell us where my colleagues and I have found that chronic nicotine does up regulate &#945;4 containing nicotinic receptors.<br />
</li><li> This gives rise to two possible mechanisms. One is a circuit based; basically the substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons would work less hard and therefore have less susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Another mechanism is up regulation in the nerve terminals of the dopaminergic neurons. That might make them under firmer control from certain interneurons that secrete acetylcholine in the stratum.<br />
</li><li> But it's the third inside out based mechanism that I'll show you in the next slide. And this is a cell delimited mechanism that takes place entirely within dopaminergic neurons. It depends on pharmacological chaperoning. And apparently it reprograms cell physiology.  </p>
</li></ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt;“Inside-out” Drug Action by Nicotine at α4β2 nAChRs</strong>
<ul><li> Now I'll go over it very briefly. We'll begin with the results of mini lecture 29 in which we found that pharmacological chaperoning leads to upregulation of nicotinic receptors on the plasma membrane of the neuron cell. But now we are following the results of pharmacological chaperoning in a new way.<br />
</li><li> We are looking deeper into the nerve cell at a phenomenon called endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response. In the endoplasmic reticulum, there is a system of sensors. Watch this spot right here which senses the presence of unassembled proteins and of unfolded proteins. The major sensor protein is here, it’s called BIP, immunoglobulin binding protein, and it activates a couple of enzymes;  as well there is a sensor for proteins that have managed to escape the endoplasmic reticulum and go to the Golgi or ATF6.<br />
</li><li> Now, the importance of these red enzymes which get activated is that they become or trigger themselves transcription factors and can operate on activation of genes. Now that is an important statement because for the first time now, one has a connection between chaperoning of nicotinic receptors and direct actions on gene activation.<br />
</li><li> It is thought that endoplasmic reticulum stress, too many unfolded proteins, and the resulting unfolded protein response. If it goes on for significant amounts of time, days, weeks, years, it can trigger cell death and so the overriding view here is, that Parkinson's disease results from a cumulative pathological process that goes on over a period of decades gradually eliminating dopaminergic neurons and that there is at the same time, a sustained protective process. Here, possibly influenced by nicotine that protects the neurons and suppresses the pathological effects of unfolded protein response.<br />
</li><li> Well clearly there are lots more data, lots more experiments to be followed in an experimental like program like this. And I'm hoping that my research group will eventually be able to get the resources to do these exciting and important experiments over the next few years. Next time we will talk about protein therapy and gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.</p>
