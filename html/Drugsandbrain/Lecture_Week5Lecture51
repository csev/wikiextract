<ul><li> Here is the culmination of our lectures on schizophrenia. We're going to be discussing drugs for schizophrenia.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Therapeutic approaches</strong><br />
<ul><li> All of the drugs that are presently approved for schizophrenia fall into the classification of antipsychotics. They suppress the positive symptoms, the psychoses, the hallucinations, the delusions, but they do not suppress the negative symptoms or the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. So that's a real challenge for future drug development and discovery.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>All of the conceptual views of antipsychotic drugs assume that they work via Outside-In pathways, the ones I've been discussing with you for these past few weeks, G protein-coupled receptors, G-protein intracellular messengers, their blockade or their activation. Most challenging of all for developing better psychiatric drugs, there's no satisfactory explanation for the therapeutic lag, the two to three week time course between the the time a person starts taking a antipsychotic drug and the time it reaches its full effects.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical potency of “classical” or “typical” antipsychotic drugs correlates best with
dopamine D2 receptor blocking dose</strong><br />
<ul><li> We start with a very famous graph for the classical or the typical antipsychotic drugs here in the upper left. This is the correlation between their drug potency measured in cell-free systems or in cellular systems and the average clinical daily dose that is required to stabilize a patient. These are all the first generation drugs, there's Chlorpromazine {which is} still used and one second generation {drug}, Clozapine which we'll take about in this lecture. {There is good correlation for the antipsychotic drugs and the dopamine D2 receptor.} For the first generation drugs, the correlation is a lot poorer for the Serotonin 5HT2A/2C receptors. And there's a very poor correlation for the &amp;alpha:1 adrenergic receptor and the histamine receptors, these are all GPCRs.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Not known how blocking Gi-coupled receptors reduces psychoses</strong><br />
<ul><li> So the question arises, well, how is the effect on the dopamine D2 receptor producing antipsychotic effects? The dopamine D2 receptor is a classical Gi-coupled receptor. We've discussed this in mini lectures 18, 19, 20 and 21. We've discussed three types of downstream effects of Gi-coupled receptors. We've discussed the activation of G protein-activated potassium channels and the modification by RGS proteins. We've discussed the effects of decreased cyclic AMP on the electrophysiological characteristics of neurons and we've discussed the pathway from receptor activation to gene activation. It is simply not known how blocking Gi-coupled receptors via either these classical pathways reduces psychosis. So, that's a challenge.  </p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Modern atypical antipsychotics also block other GPCRs and have fewer side effects</strong><br />
<ul><li> Now, the modern antipsychotics, called atypical antipsychotics also block other GPCRs, not just the dopamine D2 and also D3 receptors. And here is a classical drug, Haloperidol. Here are the atypical antipsychotic drugs, Clozapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone, Olanzapine, Sertindole, there are others.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>It is not know how blocking Gq-coupled receptors reduces psychosis. Each of these drugs has a different set of relative affinities, relative tightness of binding for the G-protein coupled receptors, and the size of this pie segment means that it's affinity for that receptor is highest.  </p></li>
<li><p>So some drugs bind most tightly to D1 dopaminergic receptors which are Gs-coupled, some to the 5HT2A receptor Gq coupled, some to the original dopamine D2 and D3 receptor. This is the conventional antipsychotic drugs. Each of these drug classes has side effects.  </p></li>
<li><p>The conventional pyschotic drugs have tardive dyskinesia as a major side effect, a movement disorder thought to be localized in the pathway from the midbrain to the striatum, a devastating side effect of the first generation drugs and a major impetus toward identifying the atypical second generation drug, but those too have side effects. For some of them weight gain, for others agranulocytosis, meaning a decrease in white cells, particularly true of Clozapine, though it's thought to be less of a problem now than was feared originally.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nicotinic drugs for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia?</strong><br />
<ul><li> So, we have this unsatisfactory picture of having drugs that really do help some aspects of schizophrenia; do not help other aspects and we don't know how they work. What about drugs for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia?<br />
</li><li> Here, we're going to go back to nicotine and make the observation that 90% of schizophrenics smoke. Here is Geoffrey Rush playing David Helfgott in the movie Shine. You'll remember that I played you an excerpt from David Helfgott playing the Rachmaninov 3. In this movie, Geoffrey Rush typically has a cigarette in his mouth.  </p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>And, here is a YouTube reference to an excerpt from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the Academy Award winning movie based on the novel by Ken Kesey from 1974. This scene has a younger Danny DeVito asking for his cigarettes.  </li>
<li><p>So, schizophrenics certainly smoke and they smoke more than typical nicotine addicts. They take deeper breaths, they hold their breaths longer, and they generally seem to extract much more nicotine per cigarette, and schizophrenics are very attached to their cigarettes.  Clearly, schizophrenics are perceiving a benefit from those cigarettes.  </p></li>
<li><p>This practice of taking in a lot of nicotine may lead to activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are lower sensitivity than the &#945;4&#946;2 receptors that we have been concentrating on for our previous discussions of nicotine addiction.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The sensory gating anomaly (mL 50) maps near the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</strong> 
<ul><li> And one reasonable suggestion is that the schizophrenics are activating the &#945;7 nicotinic receptor. Indeed, in mini lecture 50, I told you about a sensory gating anomaly shared by most schizophrenics and I told you that it maps near the &#945;7 nicotinic receptor. And so, some &#945;7 agonists are being tested for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia. That's an interesting development and we'll have to see how that works out.<br />
</li><li> So, we have a lot of challenges in drug development for psychiatric diseases and especially in drug development for schizophrenia.</p>
