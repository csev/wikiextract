<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Concepts_and_explanations">Concepts and explanations</span></h2>
<p>This is the section for explanations of particular concepts.  Users are encouraged to edit and improve explanations provided by other students.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Example:_SNPs_and_SNVs">Example:  SNPs and SNVs</span></h3>
<p>A SNV is a single-nucleotide variant, a SNP is a single-nucleotide polymorphism.  Both are places in the genome where the sequences of some people differ at a single position. Only some variants are polymorphisms - the term refers to variants that are found in at least 1% of genomes.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Consequences_of_Mutations_in_Non-Coding_DNA_Sequences">Consequences of Mutations in Non-Coding DNA Sequences</span></h3>
<p>Most mutations in DNA are neutral because only 2% of our DNA codes for proteins. (72% of our DNA is located outside genes. Of the DNA located in genes, the vast majority is located in introns, which do not code for proteins). Mutations in the following non-coding DNA sequences will, however, likely affect phenotype:
1. Sequences that affect regulation (because they are supposed to act as binding sites for regulatory proteins that control when, how strongly and in which cell types DNA is transcribed, and also how efficiently mRNA is translated into protein);
2. Intron sequences that affect splicing;
3. Genes that function as RNA, e.g. tRNAs, rRNAs and regulatory RNAs.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Consequences_of_Mutations_in_Coding_DNA_Sequences">Consequences of Mutations in Coding DNA Sequences</span></h3>
<p>Many mutations in DNA sequences that code for protein are neutral in that they do not actually change an amino acid because amino acids are specified by more than one codon. Many amino acid changes are also neutral because they do not affect protein function. (At least half of non-silent SNVs are neutral). Mutations due to replication errors by DNA polymerase in protein-coding sequences can, however, have the following consequences:
1. When DNA polymerase inserts a wrong base to cause a mismatch in base pairs, the result can be neutral, but sometimes it will cause a loss of function;
2. When DNA polymerase misses or adds one or more bases, it will usually cause a loss of function because, unless the number of bases missed or added is a multiple of three, there will be a shift in the open reading frame.
Mutations due to other errors can have the following consequences:
1. Insertions of mobile elements usually cause a loss of function;
2. Duplications or deletions of large segments can change gene dosage or cause a loss of function in genes;
3. Breaking and joining of parts of chromosomes can change gene dosage or cause a loss of function in genes;
4. Changes in the number of chromosomes can change gene dosage or cause meiosis problems.</p>
