					<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>The 2013 elections in Pakistan took place after a democratically elected government successfully completed its five year period for the first time in the history of Pakistan. Although a great achievement in terms of democratic governance but it was an election totally marred by violence and killing of secular candidates in almost all major provinces of Pakistan except Punjab. The secular parties were specifically targeted by Taliban and extremist groups with little or no protection provided by the state. The parties who won most of the seats had an extremely Anti-American and pro-extremist stand. The two main parties PTI and PML-N specifically targeted America's war on terror as a tool to win votes to the extent that both parties leaders promised shooting down American drones, blocking US supply routes and winning Taliban sympathies by promising that all operations against them will be stopped.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, secular and nationalist party leaders and activists were targeted and killed in the provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. The elections can be seen as a step forward in one sense but from another point of view, the elections were the most unfair and intolerant in the history of Pakistan. As one secular politician said that 'These elections were not decided by the Election Commission but by the leader of Taliban'.</p>
