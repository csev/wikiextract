<ul><li> [0:00:00][Slide_01]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Welcome back to Genomic Sciences. Today lecture is about experimental genetics and how experimental genetics relates to genomics. You can also consider this forward genetics. We are going to have another lecture about reverse genetics. We will talk about the distinction between those two a little bit at the beginning of this lecture.</p>
<p>We are really going to focus on how experimental genetics can relate to understanding gene function and the nuts and bolts about how the traditional forward and x screen would work (?).</p>
<p>This image here we have courtesy of the Jackson Labs is graphical map of the mouse from the 1950s where each chromosome is laid out on the wall. They have mice with phenotypes linked to each chromosome in the appropriate places. So it is sort of a genetic map but with live mice on the wall, a cool historical image.</p>
<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:162px;"><a href="/wiki/images/9/90/ExSciGen_06_S02_MethodsForDefiningGeneFunction.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/9/90/ExSciGen_06_S02_MethodsForDefiningGeneFunction.png/160px-ExSciGen_06_S02_MethodsForDefiningGeneFunction.png" width="160" height="123" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/9/90/ExSciGen_06_S02_MethodsForDefiningGeneFunction.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Methods for Defining Gene Function (Slide 02)</div></div></div>
<ul><li> [0:00:56][Slide_02]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In this course we are going to learn a lot about all these different genome-scale methods. For example, to look at whether genes are co-expressed, whether they interact with each other through protein-to-protein interactions, whether share patterns of conservation over evolution, maybe weather there is a binding site of transcription factors in the genome (?).  </p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Importance_of_Phenotype">Importance of Phenotype</span></h4>
<p>The key point to take home from this lecture is that all of this is meaningless if you do not know the loss-of-function phenotype of your gene. As much as the other pieces of information link the gene to a particular process, until you can show that losing the activity of that gene impacts a specific process you will not really know anything about what the gene is really doing.</p>
<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:162px;"><a href="/wiki/images/2/2c/ExSciGen_06_S03_ImportanceOfPhenotype.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/2/2c/ExSciGen_06_S03_ImportanceOfPhenotype.png/160px-ExSciGen_06_S03_ImportanceOfPhenotype.png" width="160" height="124" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/2/2c/ExSciGen_06_S03_ImportanceOfPhenotype.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Importance of Phenotype (Slide 03)</div></div></div>
<ul><li> [0:01:44][Slide_03]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>This is the key point. The functional importance of a gene will show itself as a loss or gain of function in the phenotype. When the gene is altered the phenotypes you see will result from the processes that are defective in those mutants. </p>
<p>These are just some images of some worms. This is what a wild type worm looks like. We have some worms here. This one is rolling around on its axis. It is called a roller worm. So maybe it has a defect in its nervous system or in its skin. These are mostly skin defects in the worm. This is called a dumpy worm, a short fat worm. It is because the skin has not properly formed to allow the worm to take its normal elongated form. This is an uncoordinated worm, it is not moving very much. This suggests that the gene that has mutated is important for muscle or nervous system activity for proper motility.</p>
<p>If you have a process that you are interested in then the classic way to identify genes important for the process is do a genetic screen, identify mutants where that process is altered in some way, and then experiment to figure out what genes are involved and how they affect the process.  </p>

<ul><li> [0:03:30][Slide_04]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>It is important to choose the right model system. Choose the simplest (cheapest) system relevant for your question.</p>
<p>For example, if you were going to do a screen about the very basics of how the secretory pathway works. That was all worked out several decades ago in yeast by  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman">Randy Schekman</a> and others using genetic screens. In that organism there are extremely powerful genetics, you can generate really large collection saturated mutagenesis. You can identify all the genes that have loss-of-function phenotypes and gain of function phenotypes that are associated with that process.</p>
<p>However you cannot use yeast to study clotting because yeast does not have blood so they do not clot. You cannot even study clotting in a worm because worms do not have vascular systems either. You have to study clotting in some invertebrate system that has a clotting system that is similar to humans.</p>
<p>Listed on the slide is a wide range of commonly used genetic systems. They span the whole evolutionary range from mouse—a mammalian model system very similar to humans, it has some advantages we will talk about—all the way to yeast, where if you were looking at a common conserved eukaryotic cell biological function then yeast is often the most economical model. You can grow 10<sup>9</sup> yeast for a couple dollars’ worth of media whereas for a mouse you are going to pay thousands of dollars in cage costs for a smaller experiment where you have just a handful of mice.</p>

<ul><li> [0:05:13][Slide_05]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>To do a phenotype-based mutagenesis, a genetic screen, you need a way to induce mutations into the genome so you can then identify individuals with a particular phenotype. We will  talk a little about breeding schemes used in animal systems for identifying mutants from screens.  </p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Inducing_Mutations">Inducing Mutations</span></h4>
<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:162px;"><a href="/wiki/images/d/df/ExSciGen_06_S06_PhenoBasedScreeningSpontaneousMutations.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/d/df/ExSciGen_06_S06_PhenoBasedScreeningSpontaneousMutations.png/160px-ExSciGen_06_S06_PhenoBasedScreeningSpontaneousMutations.png" width="160" height="114" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/d/df/ExSciGen_06_S06_PhenoBasedScreeningSpontaneousMutations.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Spontaneous Mutagenesis (Slide 06)</div></div></div>
<ul><li> [0:05:13][Slide_06]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The simplest way to induce mutations is by letting them happen on their own. Remember, mutations are fairly common. There are about 10<sup>8</sup> mutations per base. In practice this means there is going to be a loss-of-function mutation in any given gene about 1 in 10<sup>-7</sup>.  About ten of those mutations are likely to be strong loss-of-function mutations, this maybe a slight under-estimate.</p>
<p>Mutations occur spontaneously do to damage like base loss or cytosine contamination, but also through errors in DNA replication.
Over one hundred years ago Morgan identified a spontaneous white-eyed mutation in his fly stocks. </p>
<p>It is easy to grow a lot of yeast, so even though the mutation rate is 10<sup>-8</sup>, if you grow 10<sup>9</sup> yeast, you will have a lot of mutations in your population. You can plate those out and if you have some selection, for example, you are looking for yeast that grow on a particular drug. You will get colonies that correspond to your mutations without having to do any mutagenesis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are doing a genetic screen on a mouse and you can handle at most a few hundred individuals, then you are not going to reply on spontaneous mutation. You need to actively add some mutagen.</p>

<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:162px;"><a href="/wiki/images/6/60/ExSciGen_06_S07_PhenoBasedScreeningMutagenesis.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/6/60/ExSciGen_06_S07_PhenoBasedScreeningMutagenesis.png/160px-ExSciGen_06_S07_PhenoBasedScreeningMutagenesis.png" width="160" height="114" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/6/60/ExSciGen_06_S07_PhenoBasedScreeningMutagenesis.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Phenotype Based Screening Mutagenesis (Slide 07)</div></div></div>
<ul><li> [0:07:28][Slide_07]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The classic ways of doing mutagenesis are through radiation, chemicals, and insertions.  With radiation, the idea is that you have an x-ray machine, you put your mouse there—typically a male mouse so you get mutations in the sperm precursors, the idea is that each sperm will have a different mutation in it—then let them go.</p>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Radiation">Radiation</span></h5>
<p>Radiation-based mutagenesis—gamma rays, x-rays—have the advantage they tend to make fairly large mutations. They strongly affect alleles by making double-stranded breaks and then the repair of those cause big lesions. You can actually delete several genes in a row, which can really be useful if you are dealing with a process where you have a lot of duplicated genes. In most species there is an enrichment of genes that have homology to each other, being located adjacent in the genome. So radiation gives you some chance of making deletions that take out both copies of a gene if you have two.</p>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chemicals">Chemicals</span></h5>
<p>Most mutagenesis these days in most model organisms is done by chemical mutagenesis. Chemicals like EMS, with an ethyl methanesulfonate or ethyl nitrosourea which are alkylating agents. The basic idea is that these will add some kind of methyl or other alkyl group to the DNA bases and that will then cause a defect, either a miss-recognition of a base or some kind of defect associated with the repair of a base.</p>
<p>The different chemicals have different biases and different advantages. EMS is commonly used in most genetic screens with worm and fly. It will give about 1 in 2000 individuals will have a reasonably strong mutation in any given gene.</p>
<p>In mouse, EMS does not work that well, probably because it is metabolized in a way that makes it not as effective. So ENU is the mutagenesis of choice. This is sort of worked out empirically for each organism.</p>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Insertion_or_Transposon">Insertion or Transposon</span></h5>
<p>The last way is insertion or transposon mutagenesis. It is mostly used in fly where they have this phenomenal <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_element">P element</a> tool. You can have P elements, these transposons just jump into the genome. If it disrupts a gene then you have a mutation in that gene. It has the huge advantage that now you actually have a little molecular marker there that can be used to identify exactly what the gene is. If you have a phenotype you can just do some kind of inverse PCR to figure out the insertion site of your transposon and there you have your gene. It is easy, right?</p>
<p>The advantages of these mutagenesis methods are the much higher rate of mutation. In mouse it is actually astonishing, you can get a 1 in 700 mutation rate per gamete, per locus, which is amazing that can even be tolerated.</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_Much_Mutagen_to_Use">How Much Mutagen to Use</span></h4>
<p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:162px;"><a href="/wiki/images/1/1b/ExSciGen_06_S08_HowMuchMutagenToUse.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/wiki/images/thumb/1/1b/ExSciGen_06_S08_HowMuchMutagenToUse.png/160px-ExSciGen_06_S08_HowMuchMutagenToUse.png" width="160" height="114" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/images/1/1b/ExSciGen_06_S08_HowMuchMutagenToUse.png" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/wiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>How Much Mutagen to Use (Slide 08)</div></div></div>
<ul><li> [0:10:51][Slide 08]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>It is important to work this out empirically. The key feature is the dose used. You do not want to use too low of a dose because you will not get enough mutants. You do not want to use too much of a dose because the chemicals are toxic from other mechanisms and from the toxicity of having too many mutations. If you have too much of a dose you also will not have enough surviving mutants. (Too high a dose = lethality, less progeny, not enough mutants.)</p>
<p>For each system there has been, for the loss study systems, work to figure out what the optimal dose is. If you are developing a new model system you have to work this out empirically each time.</p>

<ul><li> [0:11:36][Slide 09]</p>
</li></ul>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Advantages">Advantages</span></h5>
<p>Here are the pros and cons of doing traditional forward genetics. The advantages are you can get lots of different mutations. Especially in an organism where you can get a lot of individuals, you can easily get a huge number of mutations. One of my neighbors in our genetics department here recently did a screen where they spent a couple months over the summer and they got hundreds of individual mutations that affect the process they were interested in in the worm.</p>
<p>In addition you get a rich variety of alleles. (We will talk about reverse genetics where you have a gene you are interested in and you specifically knock out that gene either by RNAi or by targeted deletion of various kinds. You specifically are trying to get strong loss of function or a null allele for those genes. With forward genetic screens you can get a wide variety of partial loss of functions, region specific loss of function, and regulatory element mutations. You can get gain of function mutations as well. )</p>
<p>Everything is tied to the phenotype that you are screening for. This I cannot emphasis enough, that if you ask a question of genetics, you will get an answer. It is not guaranteed you will get the answer that you want; you may not have been asking the question you thought you were asking. If you screen for a particular phenotype you will find out how you can get that phenotype but not necessarily what the process is that you thought was going to give rise to that phenotype. It is important to be really sure that your phenotype is specific to the process that you are interested in.</p>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</span></h5>
<p>One disadvantage is that it is a lot of work to perform a screen. I mentioned the screen that my colleague performed that the lab took doing the screen. The other (disadvantage) is that you identify all these mutants that have phenotypes related to the process you are interested in but there is a fair amount of effort involved. Once you have the mutant you have to figure out what is wrong with it.</p>
<p>As an example I mentioned in mouse mutagenesis you have 1 out of 700 genes is affected. But there is going to be thousands of sequence changes caused by that mutagenesis in any given mutant. So you have to have some way of sorting through and figure out which are the causal ones. Traditionally that will be done by first a linkage study to figure out where in the genome it is and then you will have some kind of fine mapping approach, where you try to identify mutations in the genes you had mapped your phenotype to.</p>
<p>Now this is changing a lot. The next-gen sequencing approach has provided new ways to identify mutants. We will talk about that towards the end.</p>

<ul><li> [0:14:28][Slide 10]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>A lot of what we are going to talk about is going to be in the mouse. I just want to put out the plug as to why mouse is a system that is perhaps under used for forward genetics. It is expensive; however it has a lot of advantages.  First, there is inbreeding. Inbreeding is really important. It means that both copies of the genome are essentially the same in an inbred mouse strain so you do not have the allelic diversity between two alleles in the strain getting in the way.</p>
<p>The genetics are pretty powerful. I mentioned the mutagenesis example and there are a lot of really useful tools. I am talking about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancer_chromosome">balancer chromosomes</a>, visible markers that you can use for mapping. There are really useful ways to manipulate the genome. For example you can go into ES cells and created targeted insertions and deletions in different parts of the genome. </p>
<p>Because it is such a well-studied organism and it has a lot of parallels with human development there have been a lot of detailed phenotyping. We know a lot about the way normal is supposed to look. </p>

<p>This is a quote that came out with a publication of the mouse genome in 2001 or 2002. The argument was that now with the mouse genome we can really take the variants that we identify with human disease and we can directly correlate them those to what is going on in the mouse and that mouse models are going to be the most powerful way to interpret human disease alleles. 
Now whether that is true or not, I think in many cases you can go to an even simpler system, worms or flies, and you should if that is the perfect system to do your modeling in. The mouse has the advantage of in many ways having similar physiology although definitely not identical to humans.</p>

<p>To also emphasis that some of the phenotypes, not just say, you know we think about in human genetics, things like heart attack as a phenotype, but then there is the endophenotypes, like the LDL levels and the triglycerides and so-forth-and-so-on.  So a mouse is often a good system to look at those phenotypes as well and sort of the quantitative traits.</p>

<p>If you are going to do the screen in the mouse, this is different in worms if you are going to do a phenotypic screen, typically you try to find the most specific phenotype that you can for the process that you are interested in. Maybe you have a florescent marker for a cell that you are interested in and then you screen and you look for worms that have defects, a morphological defect, or a present-absence defects if that is all you are interested in. 
Now in mouse you want to have as rich a screen as possible because you are going to deal with the issue of cost here. So if you are going to go through the cost of doing a screen, you want to get as broad a set of mutants as possible. This is where this nested phenotypic analysis comes in.
The idea is that you should start with a fairly general phenotype. We will talk about wheel running as one of those. Then when you identify mutants that have some defects in these very high-level phenotypes that are very cost effective and you can apply to your whole population, then you go and do more detailed phenotypes, maybe on subsets of the population.</p>

<ul><li> [0:17:51][Slide 14]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Here is an example of wheel running. Wheel running is a great experiment because all the mice in your screen, as long as they are up and on their feet, they will run on the wheel. You can put the mouse on the wheel and see what they do. This is a plot of what that looks like. This is just the number of different days. You put the mouse on the wheel for five, six days here. There are six different mice rather for two days. You can see that when there is a little black bar that means that the wheel was moving and when there is not it means the mouse wasn’t moving. So you can see that activity sort of corresponds… mice are nocturnal and so when it is dark, which is this period here, there is a lot of activity and when it is light there is not a lot of activity. 
Mia Luken (?) in our department did a large screen to identify using wheel running as the main phenotype. Others have used this as well. This is what happens. For example you can get not-in only defects (?) or phenotypes associated with motility and sort of the wheel running itself. You can turn off the lights and see what happens to the circadian pattern. So normally the mice will continue running in a roughly 24 hour period. This turns out it is slightly less than 24 hours. If you have a circadian mutant you will see defects in this process. So this is a broadly useful phenotype.</p>

<p>You can get visual mutants, where they do not know if it is light or it is dark; circadian rhythm mutants, where they lose their period and their connection to the rotating earth; there are muscular mutants where you have mice that have a hard time running; and sleep mutants where they are up when they are waking when they should be sleeping and running in the middle of the day time.

<ul><li> [0:20:35][Slide 19]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The simplest screen would be a dominant screen. This is an example from mouse. In mice the most common mutagenesis is ENU. You usually give the male mouse ENU in its food. The ENU wreaks havoc in the germ line. Usually you will get a period where the mice are sterile because the sperm stem cells have died back. Eventually they will repopulate and they will have mutations in them.</p>
<p>This is useful to do in a male because you can mate that male and every progeny, in theory, will have, and this is important, a different mutation. The idea is that you are aiming not to get the same mutation every time but different mutations in each individual. You mate the male mouse to an unmutangenized female, then in your first generation you will have one normal copy of each chromosome and one mutagenized copy of each chromosome. </p>
<p>If you are doing a screen for dominant mutants you can just take those first generation mice and do a phenotypic analysis. You look to see if they have trouble running on the wheel, do they have—if you are doing this in flies—what color are their eyes. Whatever your screen is you can screen in that first generation. Then if you have something you can start doing other crosses to maintain those mice.</p>

<ul><li> [0:21:59][Slide 20]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>A recessive mutation screen is much more tricky. I am going to go through the simpler version which is how we would do it in worm. Worms have the advantage of being a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite so you do not have to cross males and females. This has huge advantages in a recessive screen. Then we will go through a slightly more complicated example of how you do this in mouse.</p>
<p>In the case of worms you would use EMS instead of ENU as a mutagen. In general you would soak worms at a particular stage. The strategy is that you are primarily trying to get mutations into the sperm, although you get into the ovocytes as well in the case of worms. You grow those on a plate and you have big plate with lots of mutagenized worm. </p>
<ul>
<li>[0:22:46][Slide Change]</li>
</ul>
<p>Those will have their F1 progeny.  If you are looking for a viable mutation you can just leave those all on a small number of plates but if you are dealing with mutations that are going to be homozygous lethal—which is pretty common kind of screen to want to do, maybe you are looking for defects in skin development where the embryos blow up when they try to elongate their skin, so those would be lethal. </p>
<p>A recessive lethal in the first generation you are going to… perhaps you have one plate that has a heterozygote for that mutation on it, so it has one normal copy and one mutant copy. If you have singled, put one worm on each plate, in the second generation then these worms will go on to give a population of its own progeny and they self(?) with each other. They are taking their own sperm and their own eggs and mixing them together. This is basically the same as an inter-cross. </p>
<p>If we look in the second generation, these plates where there is not any mutation will not give us our phenotype. But on this plate where we have the heterozygote to begin with, now 25% of its progeny are going to be homozygous wild type, half [50%] are going to be heterozygotes, and a quarter [25%] of them will be homozygotes of your mutation. That is sort of denoted here with this sepia color on the worms. So you have mutant worms on the plate. You can recover the heterozygotes, if it is a lethal by picking up their siblings for the same plate.</p>

<ul><li> [0:24:35][Slide 21]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In a gonochoristic organism, an organism where you have males and females and you have to mate them together, it gets a little more complicated again.</p>
<p>The beginning is basically the same. This is true in mouse, fly, fish—you would have to do a similar kind of breeding scheme. </p>
<p>You have your ENU treated male here. Now again each sperm is going to have a different mutation in that male. You cross that with a wild type female and you get this heterozygous mutant F1. </p>
<p>Now here is the important thing. That is the only animal that has that particular set of mutations.  There are no other animals that have the same mutations. So you have to find a way to get that mutation homozygous. </p>
<p>One way you might be able to do this is to cross that heterozygous mutant to a wild type worm [mouse] and then half the progeny will be wild type and half the progeny will be heterozygous again.  If you get males and females in this next generation—it is important obviously that you have males and females—then you can cross those together with each other. If you do that, one quarter of the time you will cross two heterozygous mutants together and then a quarter of their progeny will be homozygous mutants and you will be able to see your phenotype.</p>
<p>That is definitely possible, and if you have large brood size it maybe even reasonably efficient. But there is a trick you can do to make this even more efficient and that is to cross back to the father.</p>
<p>So for that we start the same way here but instead of taking…. This is a male here. So you take a male from your first generation. You know that that is heterozygous for your mutant chromosomes. So if you make the cross between the second generation progeny—remember, half of those are going to be heterozygotes, so have of them will be wild type homozygotes—and cross those back to their father. Now half of those are going to be useful mating where you are crossing, because it only depends on this one generation’s phenotypes. Half the mating are going to give you useful distributions of progeny and the chance to see your homozygous phenotype.</p>
<p>Once you identify homozygous mutants you can pick the wild type litter mates and hopefully some of those will be heterozygotes and you can propagate your mutation.</p>

<p>One addition wrinkle you can use, this is especially useful if you have a process where you know there is a particular gene or collection of genes that are likely to be interesting and they are in a particular part of the genome but you want to have more alleles than those genes. You can do a region-specific gene where you have something called a balancer chromosome.  A balancer is most powerful… it has its longest history in flies where they have good balancers for all the chromosomes.</p>

What a balancer chromosome is ideally a multiply deleted or inverted chromosome. That chromosome has two features. One, it will be homozygous lethal. Two, it will not recombine with the normal copy of the chromosome or if it does the recombination products will be lethal. That will occur if you have one inversion or multiple inversions will make it (?) even more powerful.</p>
<p>You want suppression of recombination and it helps a lot if you have a dominant visible marker. In the case of this rump white chromosome that we use as an example, it gives you this white patch on the animal. They can also be dead if it is homozygotes. You can use those to identify mutants that are specifically in…. Basically you can get all of the mutagenized chromosomes from your particular balanced region of the genome.</p>

<p>When you do that you are going to get two types of progeny—you will get a mutant chromosome over the balancer and you will get a mutant chromosome without the balancer. Then you can use the dominant phenotype to identify which one is which. So you can just keep these ones which have the mutant over the balancer.</p>

<p>If you want to identify the homozygotes for that you can cross that mutant to another balanced mutation, in this case you have the same balancer, this rump white balancer with another dominant marker called hammer toe over it.</p>
<p>As in the earlier examples, this first heterozygous mutant is the only mutant of that type. So you need to have somebody to cross it to.  So if you do this cross to this hammer toe heterozygote you are going to get the balancer homozygotes and those are going to be lethal. That is this one here.  Then you can also get hammer toe over the mutant which will look like hammer toe. You will get hammer toe over the balancer and you will get more of your balanced mutant. This is the way you can get the balanced mutant out in a way you can recognize it easily. You can now get many individuals that have this balanced mutant chromosome that you can inter-cross with each other to maintain the mutation.</p>

<p>Once you inter-cross the balancer mutant heterozygotes you can cross those and you will pull out individuals that either have the dominant marker—these are your rump white individuals, they are heterozygotes for your mutant region—and you will get the non-rump-white individuals and those are homozygotes for your rump white individuals. You know for this particular region they are homozygotes for whatever mutations were present in… came out of your mutagenesis. You can screen detail for phenotypes in those animals.</p>

<p>Once you have your mutants breeding true how do you find what gene is involved? The old way you would do this would be traditional genetic mapping. You would cross your mutant to a number of different visible markers, you would at how frequently the recombinations between your gene and the different visible markers—maybe instead of visible markers you more recently would use SNPs or some other kind of molecular marker—you compare those to the genetic map, you can place you gene on a chromosome, you use a three-factor cross to do a fine mapping, this is all a lot of work.</p>
<p>Once you have done all the mapping you can do you probably narrowed your gene down to maybe five, ten, twenty genes and you have to look through all those genes to see which one has the mutation you can link to your phenotype.</p>

<ul><li> [0:32:31] [Slide 29]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>A more popular recent method is SNP mapping. Instead of crossing to a different visible marker for each strain you can take advantage of natural polymorphism. Human have about 1 nucleotide difference in every 1000 base pairs, it turns out in these model organisms there are similar cases. In worms there is a Hawaiian strain that also has about 1 single nucleotide polymorphism for every 1000 bases. There are similar strains for fly, for mouse, and so on.</p>
<p>You cross your mutant strain. In the simplest case you have a viable homozygous mutant here, your stain A. You cross that to strain B. Strain B is from a different natural isolate that has a bunch of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In the F1 generation, the result of that is that you are going to have heterozygotes, so you will be heterozygous for your mutant. Each one of these little lines out here represents a SNP, a location where strain A and strain B are different.</p>
<p>If you inner cross these F1s together and pull out just the mutants in the next generation, you will find it is random whether they get… sometimes they will get all strain Bs; sometimes you will get heterozygotes, strain A and strain B; sometimes you will just get strain A SNPs; but in the region directly around your mutation you are only going to be homozygous for strain A. So this is SNP mapping. It has been used for a long time now. It has been scaled up into a form that is known as Bok-Segregant analysis has been combined with whole genome sequencing to allow rapid identification of the disease mutation.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>This works with the same strategy. This example is from worm but it has also been done in mouse. You have two chromosomes, chromosome 1 and chromosome 2. The chromosome 2 is the chromosome where your mutation is.  You cross your homozygous mutant with a mapping strain. In this case it is this Hawaiian strain that has one SNP every 1000 bases or so. You get your heterozygous F1s, you inner cross, or self in the case of worms, those F1s and you pull out the mutants. </p>
<p>If you look in your pool of mutants, you pick a bunch of F2s. The mutant F2s, they are all going to be homozygous for the SNPs in the region right around the mutation. Whereas all the other places in the genome are going to have about half of the Hawaiian SNP and half of the Bristol SNP. Then you take that whole population and you sequence it. You ask, “How often do we see the Hawaiian SNP and how often do we see the Bristol SNP?</p>
<p>If you look at most chromosomes you will see roughly even amounts, there may be some technical bias but basically even amounts of the two genotypes. But if you look at the chromosome where your mutation is you will see a pattern like this. This red hatched line is the actual causative mutation and the area around that hatched line has essentially no Hawaiian SNPs, it is only the Bristol alleles. You can see a classic linkage peak where the amount of Hawaiian SNPs goes up as you go further and further away from your causative site.</p>
<p>Since you are doing whole genome sequencing here, you can go and look now in this region, where you have mapped it, what are the mutations there. Ideally you have multiple alleles and you can identify multiple different mutant strains that have mutations that cause the same phenotype in the same gene and that will give you the smoking gun. </p>

<ul><li> [0:36:36] [Slide 31]</p>
</li></ul>
<p>That is an important point, just because you map your mutation to a particular region, you map your phenotype to a particular region of the genome you find a mutation in the gene, that does not provide conclusive evidence that that gene is the gene that is responsible for your phenotype. This has happened many times that it is actually a gene next door that is the causative gene and happens to be a mutation that is not causative in the (?) gene.</p>
<p>The key point is that you have to have multiple lines of evidence to really show that a particular gene is important. One way to do that is to have multiple alleles. </p>
<p>So if you do your screen and you find four different mutants that are all mapping to that same region and they all have mutations in the same gene that is great. You can go in, if this is an experimental system where this is fairly straight forward, you can put the wild type copy of the gene back into your mutant and see if that rescues the phenotype. You can see if you can knock out that gene directly. For example by RNAi or by directed knock out and see if that causes the same phenotype as you have mapped to that region. </p>
<p>This is all supplementing the fact that you have already linked either by linkage mapping, SNP mapping with Bok-Segregant analysis or repressed efficiency mapping which is where you cross your mutant to a known deletion to see if you get a synthetic phenotype in the F1s as a result of that. </p>
<p>If you have multiple lines of evidence here, that is pretty good evidence that you have the right gene.</p>

<p>The last thing I would like to talk about today is a reverse genetic application of traditional forward genetics tools. Reverse genetics is where you have a gene you are interested in, you make a mutation in that gene and then you look at what the phenotype is.</p>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tilling">Tilling</span></h5>
<p>Tilling is an approach when you take a library. This was first done with plants but it was also done with mouse embryonic stem cells. In mouse you grow up a big population of embryonic stem cells that you mutagenize and you take different pools of those stem cells and then use a molecular screen technique—in a perfect world you actually sequence and moving forward this is the way it will be done—each of those client (?) clones, identifying clones that have mutations in a gene you are interested in and then inject those into mouse embryos to make mice out of them.</p>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Million_Mutation_Project">Million Mutation Project</span></h5>
<p>Similar project has been done in C. elegans using direct mutagenesis of worm. This is the Million Mutation Project which is being led by Bob Waterston and Don Mormon primarily, where they sequenced now almost 2000 strains and they have taken each of these strains as a result of EMS mutagenesis and it has been inner crossed so that it is as close as possible to homozygous for a collection of mutations. By sequencing these 2000 strains they have identified 800,000 mutations. That is about 400 mutations per strain. Many of these are punitive (?) null mutations. </p>
<p>You can see the number of genes they have identified. No mutation would be either a splice mutation early in a gene or a stop codon, things like that. Only about a third of the genes have those strong null mutations, there is a strong selection against those, and genes that are lethal you are just not going to pull this out of your screen. </p>
<p>They have on average nine other alleles per gene. So even in genes where maybe the deletion allele would be lethal you can actually go in and find partial loss of function alleles from this set is the idea and you go and characterize them for your phenotype.</p>

<p>There are lots of tools. We talked a little bit about mouse genetics. This web page at the Jackson Lab is really useful for learning about what tools exist for mouse genetics. There are similar databases for other organisms—worm base for worm, fly base for drosophila, there is SGD for yeast, etcetera. </p>
