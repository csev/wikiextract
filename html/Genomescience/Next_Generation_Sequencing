<p>The draft sequences were completed and were published in 2001. They proved to be extremely valuable right off the bat. For the first time you had a complete collection or very nearly complete collection of all the protein coding genes in the human genome. You had very high-quality draft sequences and scaffolds along each chromosome. You had a much better indication of how repeats were organized within the human genome, how the different kinds of sequence elements were organized near the [telomeres][Telomere], the [centromeres][Centromere], and so forth. But there were still a tremendous number of gaps in the genome.</p>
<p>While the draft was very useful -- for example, for doing evolutionary studies of individual genes, you could take the human draft and compare it with the mouse draft and an amount of organism genomes -- there were a lot of questions that could not be answered with just the draft sequence.</p>
<p>So the next phase of the Human Genome project was creating the finished reference sequence and this was a large pains-taking process. Going from draft sequence with lots of gaps to a finished sequence may not sound
like that big of a deal, but it turns out that it's extremely tedious. You need to go into each gap that's there, usually on a back-by-back basis, and figure out why there's a gap. Very often there's, those sequences are particularly difficult to sequence. Sometimes, they are virtually impossible to sequence.</p>
<p>In which case, you need to define the segment that can't be sequenced, and flag it as a certain size and incorporate that into the finished sequence.</p>
<p>Where there were gaps between clones, you needed to go back into back libraries, all kinds of back libraries and back libraries were screened to try to find a piece of cloned DNA that spanned a sequence gap that was between clones. </p>
<p>This went on basically chromosome by chromosome back-by-back for a couple of years until finally in 2003 a finished Human Genome sequence was declared. It still had some gaps, still had some problem areas, but all the available clone libraries had been screened, all of the difficult regions had been attempted at least several times. And so, at that point it was declared complete for now.</p>
