<p>After I decided to learn to program, the first thing I had to do was choose a programming language. I wanted to find the perfect programming language, one in which I could build anything I wanted. However, I found that every language has advantages and disadvantages.   </p>
<p>When I want to learn, I should choose reading books or taking courses. But books and courses aren't available for for any language you want to learn; this reduces the number of options you have to choose from!  </p>
<p>With this fact, I learn any most popular programming language with most popular books. But, after learning the fundamentals, I still cannot create a program which I want! In other words, I am still not a programmer! Even after reading huge books, this situation never changes!  </p>
<p>I become angry about this situation. If I search on the web, I see all books and all courses claim that by learning programming by them, we could succeed and create our programs. But that’s just a lie.  </p>
<p>One day, I download many books in Python and C++ (more than 700 MB) and look them very fast. I just look at them how they create programs by the examples. If that examples have good knowledge which enable me to create my programs, I start read that book and learn every sentence of that to become a true programmer. But I found out all of them have a same method! They begin with some simple statement (Hello World!) and some other aspects of programming and then, finish!  </p>
<p>These books and courses even don’t teach how to build a setup (install) file to let the people setup our program to their computer! In Python, we have many bad circumstance which confuse more and more from other languages. Python fans always claim this is very easy and powerful and could run in any device! But in fact, this language doesn’t have a visual development environment (IDE)! Indeed, Python just could create program for main operation systems like Windows, Linux, MAC and few other. Even for Android, it needs more knowledge about other programs and library codes!  </p>
<p>Wait a minute! If we manage to create a program which works well on algorithm and other necessary elements of program, we don’t have time to create visual elements and to configure it to operate on other devices. We want a simple and fast way to succeed in producing programs. But when we ask this, these repeated and false statements comes from fans of Python:<br/>
“There is no any ideal programming language or IDE!”<br/>
“Python is very easy and powerful language!”<br/>
“We have enormous resources for this language and many universities teach this language for programming!”  </p>
<p>OK! If we assume their thought is right, we go back to the beginning of our problem which I mentioned in the beginning of this article. So, I choose not to trust them and to find out a faster and easier way to reach my goal.  </p>
<p>I have searched the Internet and have found some tools which enable people to create games without knowing a programming language! All parts are available. But those tools are not ideal because they are limited to few situations and won't enable you to create any program, because they don’t cover all aspects of computer logic.  </p>
<p>I search again and also I look at all programming language which made so far. I see their facilities to create programs for any device. After that, I search on editor part of programming (IDE). I searched again to found out which tools in the computer world have all of advantage of programming language part and editor part. My search was for this desires:<br/>
<ul><li> Easy programming language<br/>
</li><li> Cross build which enable to create program for multiple device<br/>
</li><li> Visual part for creating widows, Menu, buttons, etc.<br/>
</li><li> Free and open source  </li></ul></p>
