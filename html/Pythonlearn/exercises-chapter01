<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_1_What_is_the_function_of_the_secondary_memory_in_a_computer.3F">Exercise 1   What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?</span></h1>
<p>a) Execute all of the computation and logic of the program<br />
b) Retrieve web pages over the Internet<br />
c) Store information for the long term - even beyond a power cycle<br />
d) Take input from the user  </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> (c).</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_2_What_is_a_program.3F">Exercise 2   What is a program?</span></h1>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A program is a set of instructions that specifies a computation, or at its most basic a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something. Other terms that refer to the same thing include script, code and software.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_3_What_is_the_difference_between_a_compiler_and_an_interpreter.3F">Exercise 3   What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?</span></h1>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A compiler translates a file written in high-level (human-comprehensible) language into low-level (machine) language all at once at a very very fast rate, and stores it so it can be used later. An interpreter uses high-level language and interacts (translates from high-level to low-level and back again) with a programmer in real time (human time).</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_4_Which_of_the_following_contains_.22machine_code.22.3F">Exercise 4   Which of the following contains "machine code"?</span></h1>
<p>a) The Python interpreter<br />
b) The keyboard<br />
c) Python source file<br />
d) A word processing document  </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> (a) because the Python interpreter must translate the high-level language to machine code.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_5_What_is_wrong_with_the_following_code:">Exercise 5   What is wrong with the following code:</span></h1>
<code><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; primt 'Hello world!'    
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1  
    primt 'Hello world!'  
                   ^  
SyntaxError: invalid syntax  
&gt;&gt;&gt;   
</pre></code>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 'primt' should be 'print'</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_6_Where_in_the_computer_is_a_variable_such_as_.22X.22_stored_after_the_following_Python_line_finishes.3F">Exercise 6   Where in the computer is a variable such as "X" stored after the following Python line finishes?</span></h1>
<p>x = 123  </p>
<p>a) Central processing unit<br />
b) Main Memory<br />
c) Secondary Memory<br />
d) Input Devices<br />
e) Output Devices  </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> (b), Main Memory or temporary memory. The value of the variable is not stored and not available for retrieval after the program quits.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_7_What_will_the_following_program_print_out:">Exercise 7   What will the following program print out:</span></h1>
<code><pre>x = 43
x = x + 1
print x
</pre></code>
<p>a) 43<br />
b) 44<br />
c) x + 1<br />
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically  </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> (b).</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_8_Explain_each_of_the_following_using_an_example_of_a_human_capability:">Exercise 8   Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:</span></h1>
<p>(1) Central processing unit<br />
(2) Main Memory<br />
(3) Secondary Memory<br />
(4) Input Device<br />
(5) Output Device  </p>
<p>For example, "What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit"?  </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
(1) The CPU is like the brain.  Based on sensory input, the human brain acts on conscious thought while a human is awake, similar to how a waiter or waitress waits on people and continually asks them if they need anything.<br />
(2) The main memory is like our waking consciousness - what we are thinking right now.  Someone copying data (e.g. written notes) from one place to another may store it briefly in his or her brainâ€™s short-term memory during the copy process as he or she looks away from the source to the place where she or he is copying the data.<br />
(3) The secondary memory is like our long-term memory.  A student stores information away in his or her long-term memory while studying material in order to recall it later for quizzes, even after sleeping.<br />
(4) Input devices are like our 5 senses.<br />
(5) Output devices are like our facial expressions, gestures, or speech.    </p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_9_How_do_you_fix_a_.22Syntax_Error.22.3F">Exercise 9   How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?</span></h1>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Correct the grammar and/or spelling in the source code so the program can understand the instruction.</p>
