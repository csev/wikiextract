<p><strong>Exercises 1 &amp; 2 are graded assignments. Please do not post solutions to these exercises, even after the deadline for them has passed.</strong></p>
<p>Exercise 7.1 Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the
file (line by line) all in upper case. Executing the program will look as follows:
python shout.py</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exercise_7.3:">Exercise 7.3:</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun,<br />
they add a harmless Easter Egg to their program (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Easter<em>egg</em>(media)).<br /> Modify the program that prompts the user for the file
name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name
’na na boo boo’.<br /> The program should behave normally for all other files which
exist and don’t exist.<br /> Here is a sample execution of the program:
python egg.py<br />
Enter the file name: mbox.txt<br />
There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt<br />
python egg.py<br />
Enter the file name: missing.tyxt<br />
File cannot be opened: missing.tyxt<br />
python egg.py<br />
Enter the file name: na na boo boo<br />
NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!<br />
We are not encouraging you to put Easter Eggs in your programs - this is just an
exercise.<br />
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Answer">Answer</span></h4>
<pre>   count = 0
   fname = raw_input("Enter the file name:")
   if fname == "na na boo boo":
       print "NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!"
       quit()
   try:
       fcontent = open(fname)
   except:
       print "File cannot be opened:", fname
       quit()
   for line in fcontent:
       count = count + 1
   print "There were&#160;%d subject lines in&#160;%s"%(count, fname)
</pre>
that is all!</p>
