<p><strong>scrape:</strong> When a program pretends to be a web browser and retrieves a web page, then looks at the web page content. Often programs are following the links in one page to find the next page so they can traverse a network of pages or a social network.</p>
<p><strong>socket:</strong> A network connection between two applications where the applications can send and receive data in either direction.</p>
<p><strong>spider:</strong> The act of a web search engine retrieving a page and then all the pages linked from a page and so on until they have nearly all of the pages on the Internet which they use to build their search index.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_13">Chapter 13</span></h2>

<p><strong>SOA:</strong> Service-Oriented Architecture. When an application is made of components connected across a network.</p>
<p><strong>XML:</strong> eXtensible Markup Language. A format that allows for the markup of structured data.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_14">Chapter 14</span></h2>
<p><strong>attribute:</strong> One of the values within a tuple. More commonly called a “column” or “field”.</p>
<p><strong>constraint:</strong> When we tell the database to enforce a rule on a field or a row in a table. A common constraint is to insist that there can be no duplicate values in a particular field (i.e., all the values must be unique).</p>
<p><strong>cursor:</strong> A cursor allows you to execute SQL commands in a database and retrieve data from the database. A cursor is similar to a socket or file handle for network connections and files, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>database browser:</strong> A piece of software that allows you to directly connect to a database and manipulate the database directly without writing a program.</p>
<p><strong>foreign key:</strong> A numeric key that points to the primary key of a row in another table. Foreign keys establish relationships between rows stored in different tables.</p>
<p><strong>index:</strong> Additional data that the database software maintains as rows and inserts into a table to make lookups very fast.</p>
<p><strong>logical key:</strong> A key that the “outside world” uses to look up a particular row. For example in a table of user accounts, a person’s email address might be a good candidate as the logical key for the user’s data.</p>
<p><strong>normalization:</strong> Designing a data model so that no data is replicated. We store each item of data at one place in the database and reference it elsewhere using a foreign key.</p>
<p><strong>primary key:</strong> A numeric key assigned to each row that is used to refer to one row in a table from another table. Often the database is configured to automatically assign primary keys as rows are inserted.</p>
<p><strong>relation:</strong> An area within a database that contains tuples and attributes. More typically called a “table”.</p>
<p><strong>tuple:</strong> A single entry in a database table that is a set of attributes. More typically called “row”.</p>

<p>No glossary entries for this chapter.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chapter_16">Chapter 16</span></h2>
<p><strong>absolute path:</strong> A string that describes where a file or directory is stored that starts at the “top of the tree of directories” so that it can be used to access the file or directory, regardless of the current working directory.</p>
<p><strong>checksum:</strong> See also hashing. The term “checksum” comes from the need to verify if data was garbled as it was sent across a network or written to a backup medium and then read back in. When the data is written or sent, the sending system computes a checksum and also sends the checksum. When the data is read or received, the receiving system re-computes the checksum from the received data and compares it to the received checksum. If the checksums do not match, we must assume that the data was garbled as it was transferred.</p>
<p><strong>command-line argument:</strong> Parameters on the command line after the Python file name.</p>
<p><strong>current working directory:</strong> The current directory that you are “in”. You can change your working directory using the cd command on most systems in their command-line interfaces. When you open a file in Python using just the file name with no path information, the file must be in the current working directory where you are running the program.</p>
<p><strong>hashing:</strong> Reading through a potentially large amount of data and producing a unique checksum for the data. The best hash functions produce very few “collisions” where you can give two different streams of data to the hash function and get back the same hash. MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 are examples of commonly used hash functions.</p>
<p><strong>pipe:</strong> A pipe is a connection to a running program. Using a pipe, you can write a program to send data to another program or receive data from that program. A pipe is similar to a socket except that a pipe can only be used to connect programs running on the same computer (i.e., not across a network).</p>
<p><strong>relative path:</strong> A string that describes where a file or directory is stored relative to the current working directory.</p>
<p><strong>shell:</strong> A command-line interface to an operating system. Also called a “terminal program” in some systems. In this interface you type a command and parameters on a line and press “enter” to execute the command.</p>
<p><strong>walk:</strong> A term we use to describe the notion of visiting the entire tree of directories, sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, until we have visited the all of the directories. We call this “walking the directory tree”.</p>
