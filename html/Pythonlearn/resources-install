<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Install_Python">Install Python</span></h1>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>
(Note:  As of 10 Nov 2015 a sticky post from the Coursera discussion boards says the course uses Python V2.7.10.  The main current release is V2.7.12 and may be used for this course.  </p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ubuntu">Ubuntu</span></h3>
<p>Python 2 and python 3 are both installed by default, ie they are part of the ubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-desktop etc meta-packages/virtual tasks. </p>
<p>To confirm that Python is already installed, open a terminal window and type
<pre>
python
</pre>
If so, a message similar to this should be displayed indicating which version of Python is installed: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
  [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2 
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To return to the prompt type either
<pre>
exit()
</pre>
<p>or
</p>
<pre>
quit()
</pre>
<p>or
</p>
<pre>
[ctrl]-d
</pre></p>
<p>If Python is not installed (eg it has been uninstalled for some reason), in Ubuntu type 
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python
</pre>
<p>and hit return, to get the latest version of python 2, or
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python3
</pre>
and hit return, to get the latest version of python 3.</p>
<p>Running commands with <kbd>sudo</kbd> is dangerous. Make sure you know what you are running.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="CentOS.2FFedora.2FRed_Hat">CentOS/Fedora/Red Hat</span></h3>
<p>Step 1: Install Python,</p>
<p>If you have chose the development workstation from Fedora/CentOS/Redhat, more than likely it will have Python installed, if it is not installed you can use the RPM package that comes with the distro. I'll recommend using the package that comes from the distro because you will get all the security and bug fixes when you update your system.</p>
<p>If you prefer to install from source, skip step 1 and go straight to step 2.</p>
<pre>
yum install python
</pre>
<p>For Fedora 23+</p>
<pre>
dnf install python 
</pre>
<p>Step 2: Download Python 2.7</p>
<p>Download Python using below command from python official site</p>
<pre>
cd /usr/src
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/Python-2.7.9.tgz
</pre>
<p>Step 3: Extract Archive and Compile</p>
<p>Use below set of commands to extract Python source code and compile it on your system using altinstall.</p>
<pre>
tar xzf Python-2.7.9.tgz
cd Python-2.7.9
./configure
make altinstall
</pre>
<p>make altinstall is used to prevent replacing the default
python binary file /usr/bin/python.</p>
<p>Step 4: Check the Python Version</p>
<p>Check the latest version installed of python using below command</p>
<pre>
python2.7 -V
 Python 2.7.9
</pre>
<p>Please, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tecadmin.net/install-python-2-7-on-centos-rhel/">tecadmin.net</a> for original source.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="OS_X">OS X</span></h3>
<p>If you are running OS X you already have a version of python inside the built in terminal. Just fire it up and type python for python-2.x. </p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="iOS">iOS</span></h3>
<p>There are several versions of Python available as apps for use on iPhones and iPads such as Pythonista among others.
-RPE-</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="ActivePython">ActivePython</span></h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads">ActivePython</a> is an easy single file installer for Python on Windows that does everything for you (environment variables and what not).</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows">Windows</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not required to run as administrator but it will have no or fewer installation errors later.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE FOR IMPORTING MODULES</strong> Some modules that aren't built into Python need to be installed before they can be imported to Python. Beautiful Soup is an example, and needs to be installed from the command prompt (cmd) using a program such as pip. Pip is built into the newer versions of Python so you can type "pip install (module name)" into cmd. Note that if you are getting errors, you need to navigate to the python folder and run it there, or for those with skillz, you need to set up the Python System Variable to map the path.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="ArchLinux.2FManjaro">ArchLinux/Manjaro</span></h3>
<p>The ArchLinux official repositories have both python3 and python2 available, and they can coexist in the same box. To install python2 (which is used in this course) run:</p>
<pre>
pacman -S python2
</pre>
<p>You need to explicitly call python2 instead of just python, like so:</p>
<pre>
python2 program.py
</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you accidentally call "python program.py" you'll be using python3 instead of python2 and you will probably receive error messages.</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Slackware_GNU.2FLinux">Slackware GNU/Linux</span></h3>
<p>Run python from a terminal. It comes with default installation.</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Editors_and_IDE">Editors and IDE</span></h1>
<p><strong>Note to Students:</strong> The first part of the course highly recommends that you use a text editor to input and save scripts and to run them using a command line shell. </p>
<p><strong>For Windows Users</strong>, the course suggests that you download the free application <strong><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download">NotePad++</a></strong> and execute code using the <strong>Windows Command Prompt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Mac OS X Users</strong>, the course suggests that you download the free text editor <strong>TextWrangler</strong> from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Bare Bones Software</a> available from the Mac App Store for those running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. For earlier versions of OS X, you can download the program directly from the Bare Bones Software website. To execute your code, you should use <strong>Terminal.</strong></p>
<p>There are detailed video instructions on how to install the above mentioned text editors as well as how to run programs from the respective command line shells in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/week/2">Week 2</a> of Programming for Everybody. There are also tutorials included on how to produce screen captures in order to submit work for review.</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Wingware">Wingware</span></h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wingware.com/store/free">https://wingware.com/store/free</a> This company released an integrated development environment (IDE), in many ways similar to Visual Studio or Eclipse, which is used for Java. It normally costs $95/year, but for students, even on the Coursera course, you can apply for a student license and get the software for free. You will have to register with their site, and send them an email with your information, but after you do so, they will issue you a free license key good for 180 days, for non-commercial and educational use. If you like the IDE after you complete the course, it is available for $95/year for non-commercial use, and you can also purchase it on the Steam digital download service that is used mostly for distributing video games - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/244830/">http://store.steampowered.com/app/244830/</a> (I do not have any association with WingWare, the company that makes it.

<p>Mac users: <strong>Shift + ⌘ + 3</strong> = screen shot and  <strong>Shift + ⌘ + 4</strong> = targeted piece of the screen that you can select.  You can also change the settings to default to .jpg and not .png and set a different default folder.<br />
Another Mac option: Applications-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Grab Grab Allow you to do timed windows and your full desktop. Save as tiff, then open with Preview and export as png or jpg.</p>
<p>For Spanish speaking students you may find the "Snipping tool" as "Recortes" at Windows 7/Vista/8 versions and for Portuguese speaking students this tool is labelled as "Ferramenta de Captura" at Windows 7/Vista/8 versions</p>
