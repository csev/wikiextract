<p><strong>absolute path:</strong> A string that describes where a file or directory is stored that starts at the “top of the tree of directories” so that it can be used to access the file or directory, regardless of the current working directory.<br/>
<strong>accumulator:</strong> A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result.<br/>
<strong>algorithm:</strong> A general process for solving a category of problems.<br/>
<strong>aliasing:</strong> A circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object.<br/>
<strong>argument:</strong> A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.<br/>
<strong>API:</strong> Application Program Interface - A contract between applications that defines the patterns of interaction between two application components.<br/>
<strong>assignment:</strong> A statement that assigns a value to a variable.<br/>
<strong>attribute:</strong> One of the values within a tuple. More commonly called a “column” or “field”.<br/>
<strong>BeautifulSoup:</strong> A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the BeautifulSoup code from www.crummy.com.<br/>
<strong>body:</strong> The sequence of statements within a compound statement.<br/>
<strong>body:</strong> The sequence of statements inside a function definition.<br/>
<strong>boolean expression:</strong> An expression whose value is either True or False.<br/>
<strong>branch:</strong> One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.<br/>
<strong>brittle code:</strong> Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this “brittle code” because it is easily broken.<br/>
<strong>bug:</strong> An error in a program.<br/>
<strong>catch:</strong> To prevent an exception from terminating a program using the try and except statements.<br/>
<strong>central processing unit:</strong> The heart of any computer. It is what runs the software that we write; also called "CPU" or "the processor".<br/>
<strong>chained conditional:</strong> A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.<br/>
<strong>checksum:</strong> See also hashing. The term “checksum” comes from the need to verify if data was garbled as it was sent across a network or written to a backup medium and then read back in. When the data is written or sent, the sending system computes a checksum and also sends the checksum. When the data is read or received, the receiving system re-computes the checksum from the received data and compares it to the received checksum. If the checksums do not match, we must assume that the data was garbled as it was transferred.<br/>
<strong>command-line argument:</strong> Parameters on the command line after the Python file name.<br/>
<strong>comment:</strong> Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program.<br/>
<strong>comparable:</strong> A type where one value can be checked to see if it is greater than, less than or equal to another value of the same type. Types which are comparable can be put in a list and sorted.<br/>

<strong>concatenate:</strong> To join two operands end-to-end.<br/>
<strong>condition:</strong> The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.<br/>
<strong>conditional statement:</strong> A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.<br/>
<strong>constraint:</strong> When we tell the database to enforce a rule on a field or a row in a table. A common constraint is to insist that there can be no duplicate values in a particular field (i.e., all the values must be unique).<br/>
<strong>counter:</strong> A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something happened. We initialize a counter to zero and then increment the counter each time we want to "count" something.<br/>
<strong>current working directory:</strong> The current directory that you are “in”. You can change your working directory using the cd command on most systems in their command-line interfaces. When you open a file in Python using just the file name with no path information, the file must be in the current working directory where you are running the program.<br/>
<strong>cursor:</strong> A cursor allows you to execute SQL commands in a database and retrieve data from the database. A cursor is similar to a socket or file handle for network connections and files, respectively.<br/>

<strong>hash function:</strong> A function used by a hashtable to compute the location for a key.<br/>
<strong>hashable:</strong> A type that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers, floats and strings are hashable; mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not.<br/>
<strong>hashing:</strong> Reading through a potentially large amount of data and producing a unique checksum for the data. The best hash functions produce very few “collisions” where you can give two different streams of data to the hash function and get back the same hash. MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 are examples of commonly used hash functions.<br/>

<strong>list traversal:</strong> The sequential accessing of each element in a list.<br/>
<strong>logical key:</strong> A key that the “outside world” uses to look up a particular row. For example in a table of user accounts, a person’s email address might be a good candidate as the logical key for the user’s data.<br/>

<strong>pipe:</strong> A pipe is a connection to a running program. Using a pipe, you can write a program to send data to another program or receive data from that program. A pipe is similar to a socket except that a pipe can only be used to connect programs running on the same computer (i.e., not across a network).<br/>
<strong>port:</strong> A number that generally indicates which application you are contacting when you make a socket connection to a server. As an example, web traffic usually uses port 80 while email traffic uses port 25.<br/>

<strong>reference:</strong> The association between a variable and its value.<br/>
<strong>regular expression:</strong> A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capabilities.<br/>

<strong>tuple assignment:</strong> An assignment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of variables on the left. The right side is evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the variables on the left.<br/>
<strong>type:</strong> A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).<br/>
