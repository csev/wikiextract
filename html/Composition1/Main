<p>I AM A WRITER</p>
<p>My name is Bob and I’m a writer from Toronto. My first writing experience was in grade seven. Our teacher emphasized creative writing on a few pre-selected topics. She played classical music in the background while we wrote. Later at university I wrote for course assignments in sociology, philosophy (ethics), history and a drama course. I was studying in London at the time and the theatre district simply blew me away:  fringe theatre, west end musicals and Shakespearean classics. After university my writing was mostly business letters; letters to the editor, reports and blogs. Some of my favorite writers were Hunter S. Thompson, J.K. Galbraith and writers of letters, opinions and articles in the New York Times, New Yorker and Rolling Stone. </p>
<p>I like to write about sustainability, renewable energy and social-economic issues. 
My writing challenges deal mostly with structure: catching reader interest, retaining focus and closing with a resolution, instead of a dangling, “And what’s your point?” I want to develop skills in the craft by emulating the methods (art and science) employed by good writers, while evolving a consistent style suitable to the topic. </p>
<p>Great communicators use analogy as an effective tool to hide complexity and covey meaning.  And brevity to retain interest and focus.  My mission for this course: learn to write better in plain words with a productive engaging style and structure.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Tracy… I am not a professional writer, I don’t have any published novels, never written an article and don’t even have a Blog (gasp)… I write business cases, emails and some training material at work and at least once a day I think about sitting down and writing a novel, but I never do.</p>
<p>I started writing training material mostly by accident, we had a need for training in our department and there was nothing.  So I took on the task and was please to discover that I had a knack for it.  Since that time I have developed two training manuals, a five day in classroom training program, countless corporate policies and procedures.
My earliest writing experience was at the age of 11, I started a story that was 30 pages. My family noticed that I was writing and asked to read my story.  Fear and anxiety that’s all that I remember.  No one ever got to read the story nor did I finish it. I threw it out and then I stopped writing…stories at least.</p>
<p>So it seems that I am a writer that is content writing academically, but deep down inside wants to let loose her creative writer.  I do enjoy academic writing, but I dream about creating works of fiction and hope to one day put myself out there for anyone that is interested to critic and enjoy.  I hope this course will support my goal of becoming a better academic writer and my hidden dream (guess it’s not hidden anymore) to explore creative writing. I think about writing all the time and I know with the proper guidance and feedback I will gain some confidence and continue do what I love, just in a slightly different way.</p>

<p>My name is Manelisi Klaas and I am not a writer but, I do write pieces of poems at times.  Most times when I write, it will only be formal e-mail communication to the students I serve with administration work for courses they attend within the university I work at. My passion for writing started when I was young and used to do drawings of characters, and in turn I would imagine my characters speaking and introducing themselves, as whoever or whatever. To my surprise when I got to the university, that, there were societies that where focused on arts, media and cultural interests, this further lead to words and expressions.</p>
<p>I then continued to write my pieces of poems seeing there was nothing wrong with writing, not to mention after you have written there is always going to be people who want to read what you wrote and, if I did have the guts to let them read and critique me then, I would not have the same confidence of writing anything I write freely today, whether it be a piece of poem as usual, as well as formal e-mail communication to my students or, business proposal documents for my small business.</p>
<p>I have started to write a short story about my high school youth days, but this time around I wanted to make it read, and be encoded properly by all those who get their hands on my short story. Lastly, I have a poem that was publicized by the university I work for, which was selected in a competition of poem writing, and I always look up to that when writing anything.</p>
