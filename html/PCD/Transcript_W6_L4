<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_6:_6.4_-_Non-apoptotic_functions_of_the_Bcl-2_superfamily">Week 6:  6.4 - Non-apoptotic functions of the Bcl-2 superfamily</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Over the past five weeks, you have gotten to know the major components of the central, conserved apoptosis pathway: the Bcl-2 super-family, Apaf-1-like adaptors, cytochrome c and caspases.     </li>
<li>Cytochrome c was initially identified because of its role as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and only much later was it found to also play a critical role in apoptosis, at least in vertebrates.    </li>
<li>Caspase-like proteases were initially identified because of their role in inflammation. The interleukin-1-beta converting enzyme, ICE, now referred to as Caspase 1, was identified as a protease that can cleave and mature the cytokine interleukin 1 beta. Only after <em>C. elegans</em> ced-3 had been cloned, however, was it discovered that ICE-like proteases in higher organisms also have a role in apoptosis.   </li>
<li>In contrast, Apaf-1-like adaptors and Bcl-2-like proteins were initially identified because of their role in apoptosis. In the case of Apaf-1-like adaptors, it was through genetic studies in <em>C. elegans</em> and through biochemical studies in mammals. In the case of Bcl-2-like proteins it was through genetic studies using follicular lymphoma and <em>C. elegans</em> as models.   </li>
<li>Do Apaf-1-like adaptors and Bcl-2-like proteins have non-apoptotic functions like cytochrome c for example? Do they also have a day job and a night job? At least to my knowledge, there is currently no confirmed report of non-apoptotic functions of Apaf-1-like adaptors. However, there are confirmed reports of non-apoptotic functions for members of the Bcl-2 superfamily and I would like to spend the next few minutes telling you about some of those.   </li>
<li>Many Bcl-2 family members localize, at least, in part to mitochondria. Those are mammalian Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, BCl-W, Mcl-1 and <em>C. elegans</em> ced-9, and therefore all of the major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins, the guardians. But also mammalian Bak and a fraction of Bax localize to mitochondria and so do many of the mammalian BH3-only proteins.   </li>
<li>Most BH3-only proteins in mammals have a transmembrane domain, and therefore can directly associate with mitochondria, such as Bim. Since many of these Bcl-2 proteins that I just listed do not only associate with mitochondria in apoptotic cells but also in healthy cells, it might not be surprising that some of them have been implicated in various aspects of mitochondrial function.   </li>
<li>However, because Bcl-2 family members of course have an apoptotic function, their manipulation always affects the apoptotic fate of cells. For this reason, studies on their non-apoptotic functions have been difficult and, in general, conclusive evidence for their non-apoptotic functions are still missing.   </li>
<li>This is a general problem with bi-functional proteins. It is often difficult or impossible to separate their functions and therefore to determine whether these functions are dependent on each other or independent of each other.   </li>
<li>More than 10 years ago, Jean Claude Martinou, Richard Youle and their co-workers, who had done very important work on Bax, noticed that the expression of Bax causes a change in the morphology of mitochondria in mammalian tissue culture cells. I briefly mentioned in one of the previous sections that mitochondria are highly dynamic and often divide and fuse. And a change in the rate of fusion and/or fission can affect the overall, steady-state morphology of mitochondria within a cell.  </li>
<li>What Martinou, Youle and co-workers found is that apart from inducing caspase activation and apoptosis, the expression of Bax in mammalian tissue culture cells causes mitochondrial fragmentation. The mitochondrial network basically fragments. This fragmentation is an early event since it occurs even in presence of caspase inhibitors.  </li>
<li>Furthermore, the fragmentation is mediated by the dynamin-related GTPase Drp-1, which had previously been shown to be required for mitochondrial fission. What was surprising is that blocking mitochondrial fragmentation in Bax-expressing cells by expressing a dominant-negative Drp-1 construct slowed down the apoptotic process and delayed apoptosis. This suggested that Bax-induced mitochondrial fragmentation contributes or promotes the apoptotic process.   </li>
<li>How does mitochondrial fragmentation contribute to or promote apoptosis? A number of reports have since suggested that what mitochondrial fragmentation does is to promote the release of cytochrome c. However, how it does so is unclear and that is in part because, remember, we still don't really understand how cytochrome c is released.   </li>
<li>That mitochondrial fragmentation in apoptotic cells is conserved in <em>C. elegans</em> was then shown a couple of years later by us. We found that during <em>C. elegans</em> embryogenesis, mitochondria fragment within about 20 min after the expression of <em>egl-1</em> becomes detectable with an <em>egl-1</em> reporter.   </li>
<li>Furthermore, we could show that the expression of a dominant-negative construct of Drp-1 can block some of the 131 apoptotic cell death that occur during <em>C. elegans</em> development and conversely we could show that the overexpression of wild-type Drp-1 could induce ectopic apoptosis. How drp-1 can induce apoptosis in <em>C. elegans</em> is something that we have not elucidated yet.   </li>
<li>What we also found and that brings me to the non-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2 like proteins is that not only <em>egl-1</em> but also <em>ced-9</em> was required for mitochondrial fragmentation in apoptotic cells. Remember when we talked about the fact that <em>C. elegans</em> does not have a Bax homolog and about the data from the Horvitz lab that <em>ced-9</em> might adopt a pro-apoptotic function in cells that are programmed to die? I think this is CED-9's pro-apoptotic function, the ability to, when bound to EGL-1, induce mitochondrial fragmentation, which then through an unknown mechanism promotes apoptosis. But back to non-apoptotic functions.   </li>
<li>Based on this finding we wanted to know whether the expression of <em>ced-9</em> in healthy cells has an effect on mitochondrial morphology. We found that the expression of <em>ced-9</em> in <em>C. elegans</em>, either in embryonic cells or in muscle cells in larvae, induces mitochondrial fusion and the formation of highly fused, large mitochondria.</li>
<li>And the ability of ced-9 to cause mitochondrial fusion is dependent on two dynamin-related GTPases, which are required for mitochondrial fusion, FZO-1, the <em>C. elegans</em> homolog of the mammalian mitofusins and EAT-3, the <em>C. elegans</em> homolog of mammalian Opa1. Furthermore, we found that <em>ced-9</em> directly interacts with FZO-1, which like <em>ced-9</em> localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane.   </li>
<li>Is the ability of Bcl-2-like proteins to induce mitochondrial fusion conserved? Interestingly, Richard Youle and co-workers had already shown that Bax and Bak are also required for mitochondrial fusion. They found that in Bax/Bak double knock-out mice, mitochondria were somewhat fragmented. Based on this finding they concluded that in healthy cells in mammals, Bax and Bak are required for mitochondrial fusion.   </li>
<li>They also found that Bax and Bak promote mitochondrial fusion by activating the assembly of mitofusins, the dynamin-related GTPases that are required for mitochondrial fusion and that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Various reports have since confirmed that additional Bcl-2-like proteins such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 can affect mitochondrial dynamics in healthy cells. What's still unclear is what the physiological role of their ability to affect mitochondrial dynamics is.   </li>
<li>What is the physiological role of mitochondrial dynamics in the first place? Even that is only now being systematically investigated. Mitochondrial morphology and architecture affect - to a certain degree - many if not most aspects of mitochondrial function. For example, changes in mitochondrial morphology due to changes in mitochondrial fusion or fission often go along with changes in the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and hence, changes in the ability of mitochondria to generate ATP.</li>
<li>Conversely, changes in the activity of the electron transport chain affect mitochondrial dynamics and hence mitochondrial morphology. Based on this it is to be expected that changes in mitochondrial morphology caused by Bcl-2-like proteins indirectly also affect the ability of mitochondria to generate ATP.   </li>
<li>Is this the physiological, non-apoptotic function of Bcl-2-like proteins? To change mitochondrial morphology and therefore the ability of mitochondria to generate ATP? Changes in mitochondrial morphology probably affect other aspects of mitochondrial function as well for example the role of mitochondria in the storage of Ca ions.</li>
<li>They most likely indirectly also affect cellular metabolism, something that is intimately connected to mitochondrial function. I think to unravel all this is one of the major challenges in the future. I also think that it's one of the most exciting challenges of the future.   </li>
<li>Before I move on to caspases, one more thing about Bcl-2-like proteins and mitochondria. There is increasing evidence that Bcl-2-like proteins do not only localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane but to the inner mitochondrial membrane and even, as soluble proteins, to the matrix.   </li>
<li>A publication by Marie Hardwick, Elizabeth Jonas, and co-workers a couple of years ago reported that Bcl-XL is also found in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it appears to interact with the ATP synthase and where it promotes a stable membrane potential across the inner membrane potentially by decreasing membrane leakiness.   </li>
<li>Furthermore, Josef Opferman and co-workers reported that two forms exist of Mcl-1. One form of Mcl-1 that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it fulfils Mcl-1's anti-apoptotic function. However, a second, shorter form of Mcl-1 can be imported into the mitochondrial matrix through a Tom- and Tim-dependent process. This matrix form of Mcl-1 affects various mitochondrial processes and functions: it affects mitochondrial dynamics and cristae structure on the one hand and respiration, membrane potential, the oligomerization of the ATP synthase and ATP production on the other.   </li>
<li>As I mentioned earlier, these processes may all be functionally connected. So, yes, maybe the ability to affect mitochondrial ATP production may indeed be a physiological role of Bcl-2-like proteins.  </li>
</ul>
