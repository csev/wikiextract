<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_4.2C_Lecture_2_-_Apaf-1_Apaf-2_and_Apaf-3">Week 4, Lecture 2 - Apaf-1 Apaf-2 and Apaf-3</span></h1>
<p>Using a biochemical approach, Xiaodong Wang and co-workers had purified - from HeLa cell lysates three proteins, Apaf-1, Apaf-2, and Apaf-3, which could cause pro-caspase-3 cleavage and activation in the test tube. The next question of course was what these three proteins were? What were their identities and what did they do?  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first one to be identified was Apaf-2. Apaf2 turned out to be a small protein with a molecular weight of 15 kDa. In addition, the pellet of the pure protein was pink. This suggested that the protein might be a heme protein, a protein that has as a co-factor or prosthetic group a heme. Heme is a large heterocyclic organic ring, called a porphyrin, with an iron ion in its center. And this iron ion causes the pink coloration. The molecular weight or size of Apaf-2 and the fact that it may be a heme protein suggested that it could be cytochrome c. And indeed amino acid sequencing confirmed that Apaf-2 is identical to cytochrome c.  </p></li>
<li><p>What is cytochrome c?  Remember, a few sections ago we talked about mitochondria and that their main function was to convert energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Mitochondria convert energy that we take up through our nutrition into ATP and the enzymatic machinery that does this is the electron transport chain, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.  </p></li>
<li><p>This electron transport chain is composed of five complexes, complex I, II, III, and IV and the ATP synthase, which uses the electrochemical proton gradient generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane by complexes I, II, III, and IV to synthesize ATP.  </p></li>
<li><p>Cytochrome c is also a component of the electron transport chain. Its heme group can accept one electron from complex III, which it then transfers to complex IV. Cytochrome c is an electron carrier and without it, the electron transport chain wouldn’t be able to function and the ATP synthase wouldn’t be able to make ATP. Cytochrome c is essential for our cells’ ability to generate mitochondrial ATP and this is critical for cellular and organismal viability. Without cytochrome c, multicellular animals are unable to live.  </p></li>
<li><p>Where in mitochondria is cytochrome c located? In contrast to complexes I through IV and the ATP synthase, cytochrome c is not integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane but is in the inter-membrane space loosely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane.  </p></li>
<li><p>How does cytochrome c get into mitochondria? In higher eukaryotes, mitochondria have more than one thousand different proteins associated with them that localize to the different mitochondrial membranes and compartments. Only a handful of these mitochondrial proteins are still encoded in the mitochondrial genome. Most of them are encoded by the nuclear genome, are translated in the cytoplasm and are imported into mitochondria post-translationally through transporters in the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane called TOM and TIM. And that’s also true for cytochrome c.  </p></li>
<li><p>Cytochrome c is encoded by the nuclear genome and is synthesized as a pro-form referred to as “apocytochrome c” in the cytoplasm, which is then imported into the inter-membrane space in a TOM-dependent manner. During this import, the heme group is attached and the protein matures to “holocytochrome c”.  </p></li>
<li><p>The finding that Apaf-2, a factor required for pro-caspase-3 activation, a crucial step in the commitment to the apoptotic fate, is cytochrome c, an essential protein with a dedicated function in the electron transport chain, was a bit of a shock, at least for me! And I have to admit that I didn’t believe it initially. But soon, the data supporting this new concept became so strong that it was clear that this is really true.  </p></li>
<li><p>Why was it a bit of a shock? Cytochrome c was the first factor with a role in apoptosis identified that – in parallel- had a very important role in a cellular process other than apoptosis. Cytochrome c basically has two fundamentally different jobs, ATP production on one hand AND commitment to the apoptotic fate, on the other; like a day job and a night job. As we will see later, that has turned out to be the case for a number of other components of the apoptosis pathway.  </p></li>
<li><p>Now back to the role of cytochrome c in the activation of pro-caspase-3. Pro-caspase-3 is located in the cytoplasm but cytochrome c is located in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria. How should that work? How should cytochrome c be able to promote pro-caspase-3 cleavage?  </p></li>
<li><p>Xiaodong Wang and co-workers found that in response to apoptotic stimuli, cells release cytochrome c from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria into the cytoplasm. And this was shown for various apoptotic stimuli, for example, the exposure to agents that cause cells to die, such as protein kinase inhibitors, or UV irradiation, or the removal of growth factors. The release of cytochrome c turns out to be a common feature of apoptosis, at least in vertebrates.  </p></li>
<li><p>We now know that in response to apoptotic signals, HeLa cells, for example, release most of their cytochrome c from most of their mitochondria and the release occurs within about 5 min. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the injection of holocytochrome c but not apocytochrome c into the cytoplasm of cells can trigger apoptosis even in the absence of apoptotic stimuli. Why do you think apocytochrome c might not be active?  </p></li>
<li><p>The fact that holocytochrome c but not apocytochrome c can trigger apoptosis when injected demonstrates that only cytochrome c that has been matured inside mitochondria has pro-apoptotic activity. That’s a safe guard mechanism to make sure that apocytochrome c newly synthesized in the cytoplasm does not trigger apoptosis before its import into mitochondria. I mentioned a few minutes ago that cytochrome c is imported into the inter-membrane-space post-translationally in a manner that is dependent on the transporter complex in the outer mitochondria membrane, the TOM complex. Now that we know that cytochrome c is released in response to apoptotic signals, how is it released? How does it get across that outer membrane again?  </p></li>
<li><p>Shortly after the identification of cytochrome c was published in the journal Cell in 1996, a number of investigators showed that cytochrome c release in response to apoptotic signals can be blocked by Bcl-2. Based on this observation it was proposed that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein might prevent apoptosis by blocking cytochrome c release. Together with the fact that cytochrome c is required for pro-caspase-3 activation, this finding placed cytochrome c downstream of the Bcl-2 superfamily and upstream of caspase-3 in the mammalian apoptosis pathway.  </p></li>
<li><p>A year after the publication of Apaf2, Xiaodong Wang’s group published the identification of Apaf-1. Apaf-1 turns out to be a large protein of 1194 amino acids and a molecular weight of about 130 kDa. And its amino acid sequence turned out to reveal motifs and similarities to known proteins in the data bases.  </p></li>
<li><p>At its C-terminal end, the Apaf-1 protein contains twelve WD40 repeats. WD40 repeats are short structural motifs of about 40 amino acids in length that are thought to mediate interactions between proteins. Four to 16 of such WD repeats together can form a WD40 domain and are thought to form a circularized beta-propeller structure.  At its other end, its N-terminus, the Apaf-1 protein showed sequence similarity with two proteins of known functions. Guess which ones?  </p></li>
<li><p>At its N-terminus, the Apaf-1 protein shows sequence similarity with <i>C. elegans</i> CED-3 and CED-4! And that was great! The sequence similarity between Apaf-1 and CED-3 is restricted to the first 85 amino acids of the Apaf-1 sequence and the similarity between Apaf-1 and CED-4 is found between amino acids 92 and 412 of the Apaf-1 sequence. In Apaf-1, the twelve WD40 repeats then follow however those are not found in the CED-4 protein. This finding meant even more conservation at the molecular level between the apoptotic pathways in worms and mammals!  </p></li>
<li><p>What does Apaf-1 do? Remember, together with Apaf-2, which turns out to be cytochrome c, and Apaf-3, a factor whose identity was still unknown, Apaf-1 causes cleavage and activation of pro-caspase-3 in vitro. What was known about <i>C. elegans</i> CED-4? It was known that CED-4 acts upstream of CED-3 to activate pro-CED-3. Therefore, Apaf-1 and CED-4 both are required for the activation of caspases. But how do they do this?  </p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that Apaf-1 binds to cytochrome c once cytochrome c is released from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria and that the binding is mediated through the WD40 domain that is found at the C-terminal end of the Apaf-1 protein but that is missing in <i>C. elegans</i> CED-4.  </p></li>
<li><p>A few months after Apaf-1 was published also in the journal Cell, another publication from the Wang lab was published in Cell as well and that was the identification of Apaf-3, the last one of the three factors that they had identified as being required for pro-caspase-3 activation in vitro. Apaf-3 was found to be another caspase, caspase-9. This caspase looks a bit different than caspase-3.  </p></li>
<li><p>It is different in its N-terminal pro-domain. In caspase-3, this domain is pretty short and it doesn’t share any sequence similarity with the pro-domain of CED-3. In addition, the caspase-3 pro-domain gets cut off during pro-caspase-3 cleavage and activation. However, the caspase-9 pro-domain shares sequence similarity with the prodomain of ced-3. Furthermore, during the activation of pro-caspase-9, this domain seems not to be cleaved.  </p></li>
<li><p>What is this pro-domain in pro-caspase-9 and also in pro-CED-3 good for? This domain is now referred to as CARD domain, which stands for caspase recruitment domain, and this domain is thought to interact with other CARD domains therefore mediating interactions between CARD-domain-containing proteins.  </p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly, mammalian Apaf-1 and <i>C. elegans</i> CED-4 also have such a CARD domain on their N-terminal ends. And indeed, it could be shown that pro-caspase-9 and Apaf-1 as well as pro-CED-3 and CED-4 interact through their CARD domains. Could it be that the interaction between pro-caspases and these Apaf-1 and CED-4 like proteins is important for caspase activation?  </p></li>
<li><p>I just told you a lot of things. Let’s try to bring all of this together in the mammalian apoptosis pathway. In mammals, cytochrome c is released from the inter-membrane space in response to apoptotic stimuli. Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c binds to the WD40 domain at the C-terminal end of Apaf-1. Apaf-1 can also bind to pro-caspase-9 and this binding is mediated through the CARD domain, which is located at the N-terminus both proteins. This all together in vitro is then leading to pro-caspase-3 activation.  </p></li>
<li><p>But how is pro-caspase-9 activated and how does it activate pro-caspase-3? Through various biochemical and structural studies we now know that the release of cytochrome c and its binding to Apaf-1 allows the formation of the apoptosome, a wheel composed of seven spokes, which was determined by cryoelectron microscopy of single apoptosome particles at a resolution of 12.8 angstrom. This apoptosome is composed of seven Apaf-1 molecules each bound to one cytochrome c molecule. Once the apoptosome has assembled, potentially up to seven molecules of pro-caspase-9 can be recruited to the apoptosome through CARD-CARD interactions with Apaf-1.   </p></li>
<li><p>This then is thought to lead to forced dimerization of pro-caspase-9 molecules. While pro-caspases are much less active than cleaved, fully active caspases, they do have some low level of proteolytic activity. This low level of activity is sufficient to cleave and therefore activate other pro-caspase-9 molecules, if in close vicinity, as is the case when two pro-caspase-9 molecules bind to the same apoptosome and are forced to dimerize. The function of the apoptosome therefore is to bring together pro-caspase-9 molecules so that activation in “trans” can occur, activation between molecules. This is also referred to as induced-proximity model. Once activated, caspase-9 appears to stay associated with the apoptosome and function to activate pro-caspase-3.  </p></li>
<li><p>The identification of caspase-9 also revealed that there are caspase cascades in mammals, with upstream or initiator caspases such as caspase-9 and downstream or effector caspases such as caspase-3. Using inhibitors specific to either caspase-9 or caspase-3, it could also be shown that the activation of caspase-3 was dependent on caspase-9 but that the activation of caspase-9 was independent of caspase-3.  </p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, using specific substrates for caspase-9 or caspase-3, it could be shown that the kinetics or timing of their activation was somewhat different during the apoptotic process. Caspase-9 activation occurs before caspase-3 activation. Both of these types of studies, the inhibitor as well as the activity studies, took advantage of the fact that different caspases have different, preferred cleavage sites and that peptides covering these preferred cleavage sites can either be used as specific inhibitors or specific substrates for individual caspases.</p></li>
