<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_6:_6.6_-_Human_disease_and_novel_therapeutics">Week 6:  6.6 - Human disease and novel therapeutics</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>In the last couple of sections, I focused on non-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2 family members and of caspases. In the case of Bcl-2 family members, I talked about their non-apoptotic functions in mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial physiology. In the case of caspases, I talked about their non-apoptotic functions in development and differentiation and, specifically, the terminal differentiation of spermatids in <em>Drosophila</em>. In this section, I would like to focus on the role of Bcl-2 family members and of caspases in human disease and in cancer, in particular.     </li>
<li>Deregulation of apoptosis, which means that cells that should undergo apoptosis fail to do so or, conversely, that cells that should live inappropriately undergo apoptosis, can be detrimental to development and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In the first week of this course, we already talked about the consequences of too little or too much programmed cell death. The consequences are very similar in the case of too little or too much apoptosis, which, as you know, is also referred to as programmed cell death type I.   </li>
<li>Too little apoptosis can contribute to disorders such as cancer or autoimmune diseases. Too much apoptosis can contribute to disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases.   </li>
<li>What kind of genetic alterations or mutations could lead to either too little or too much apoptosis? Having an understanding of the central apoptosis pathway, now you should be able to answer this question. We actually started to unravel the central apoptosis pathway in this course with the Bcl-2 story. The Bcl-2 gene was discovered because its overexpression in patients with a t(14; 18) translocation causes B cell lymphoma.   </li>
<li>Subsequently, the overexpression of Bcl-2 was also found to play a dominant role in various other lymphoid malignancies, malignancies of the lymphatic system. Almost 30 years after the discovery of the Bcl-2 gene, we now know that the overexpression of not only Bcl-2, but also Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This overexpression can occur through chromosomal translocations like in patients with the t(14;18) translocation, through amplification of chromosomal regions or through epigenetic modifications, modifications to the chromatin, which then lead to inappropriate transcriptional upregulation.   </li>
<li>Furthermore, the overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 not only contributes to malignancies of the lymphatic system and of the blood, but also to solid tumors such as lung cancer and colon cancer. And the general consensus is that it is the overexpression of these anti-apoptotic factors that keeps the cancerous cells alive.   </li>
<li>This is based on the observation that - for instance - blocking Bcl-XL activity in cancer cells that overexpress Bcl-xL kills these cells. Based on these findings, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, basically the guardians, became a prime target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics and a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies started to develop such inhibitors.   </li>
<li>If it were your job to develop such an inhibitor, what would you use as a strategy or what do you think such an inhibitor should do? Maybe consider how the guardians act in apoptosis for a moment. How do they fulfill their anti-apoptotic functions and how are their anti-apoptotic functions inactivated or inhibited once a cell has been instructed to die? BH3-only proteins, the sensors, are key!   </li>
<li>In cells that have been instructed to die, they are activated through various molecular mechanisms, which we discussed last week, and their binding to the receptor domain of the guardians leads to the inactivation of the guardians. Therefore, the goal was to identify BH3 mimetics, small peptides or small molecules that do what BH3-only proteins do and that is to bind to the receptor-domain of the guardians thereby causing the inactivation of the guardians.   </li>
<li>Approaches used to identify such compounds were wet screening of libraries using real compounds and also in silicio screening' using virtual libraries of compounds. The wet screening of libraries involved, for example, the use of cancer cell lines, whose survival is dependent on the overexpression of the guardians. Thousands of compounds were then tested, one by one, for their ability to inhibit guardian-dependent survival of these cells. For the in silico approach it was critical to have the 3D structure of the guardians available. With the help of these 3D structures, virtual libraries of compounds could be tested in silico for their ability to bind to the guardians and to cause their inactivation.   </li>
<li>About 5-10 years ago, the first BH3 mimetics were identified and published and several ones have since been developed. For example the compounds ABT-737 and ABT-263, which are structurally similar and which like BH3-only proteins - induce Bax- and Bak-dependent killing of cancer cells. Their discovery really has opened up the possibility to treat those types of cancers for which the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins has been shown to be critical for cell survival.   </li>
<li>ABT-737 is a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, which means that it inhibits at least to a certain degree - all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and others. ABT-263, which is also called navitoclax, is not a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor. It inhibits predominantly Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. In the case of ABT-263, phase 2 clinical trials are already well under way and the results so far are very promising.   </li>
<li>However, during these clinical trials it has become apparent that ABT-263 might not be the perfect Bcl-2 inhibitor or the perfect cancer drug. What has been observed is that in patients that obtain ABT-263, the number of platelets in the blood decreases dramatically. Platelets, or thrombocytes as they are also called, are small disc shaped fragments of cells, without a nucleus, that are circulating in the blood and that have an important function in blood clotting.   </li>
<li>What does the observation that ABT-263 causes a drop in the number of platelets suggest? It suggests that Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL function is required for the formation or survival of platelets. It turns out that it is actually Bcl-XL and not Bcl-2 that is required for the survival of platelets. So what can you do? You could take ABT-263 and try to modify it so that it no longer binds to and blocks Bcl-XL. This sounds easy but it might actually not be so easy because, remember, the determination of the 3D structure of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL etc revealed that Bcl-2 proteins are highly similar at the level of their 3D structures.   </li>
<li>Furthermore, even if you manage to develop such an inhibitor specific for Bcl-2, such an inhibitor might no longer kill cancer cells as well as the original compound did. In January this year a group of scientists from AbbVie, Genentech and a number of academic research institutions reported in the journal <em>Nature Medicine</em> a new BH3-mimetic, ABT-199. And what they had done to develop ABT- 199 is exactly what I just talked about. They used ABT-263 and the structure of a unique Bcl-2-small molecule co-crystal to rationally design ABT-199. ABT-199 turns out to specifically bind to and block Bcl-2 and not Bcl-XL and in preclinical trials, ABT-199 causes substantially less platelet killing compared to ABT-263.   </li>
<li>Fortunately, ABT-199 appears not to have lost its potency with respect to its ability to kill cancer cells. Clinical trials are underway now for ABT-199 as well and it will be very interesting to see what becomes of it. We talked about non-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2 family members earlier this week and the fact that Bcl-2-like proteins have such non-apoptotic functions of course will make the use of Bcl-2 inhibitors - at least the long-term use potentially very challenging.   </li>
<li>However, I am very excited about the recent developments with BH3 mimetics and I am confident that they will lead to novel cancer therapeutics. BH3 mimetics are a great example of how scientific insight gained through basic research can contribute to our ability to develop and design very powerful drugs. This is why I think it is crucial that we continue to do basic discovery driven science rather than focus primarily on very goal-oriented applied research.   </li>
<li>And here is the reference for the publication of ABT-199 earlier this year. Coming back now to the Bcl-2 superfamily, the anti-apoptotic guardians are proto-oncogenes, their overexpression can cause and/or contribute to tumorigenesis.   </li>
<li>What about the pro-apoptotic family members, the sensors or BH3-only proteins and the effectors, Bax and Bak? Are they, conversely, tumor-suppressors? Can their inactivation cause or contribute to tumorigenesis? There is evidence that the loss of specific BH3-only genes causes and/or contributes to various types of cancers. For example, loss-of-function mutations in the BH3-only gene Bad have been implicated in colon adenocarcinomas.   </li>
<li>Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in Bim have been implicated in Burkitt lymphoma and Mantle lymphoma. Furthermore, loss of expression of the BH3-only gene Puma has been implicated in various types of cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer, gastric carcinomas, gliomas and melanomas.   </li>
<li>Finally, there is also evidence for loss-of-function mutations in the Bax gene in a small percentage of colon cancers and gastric cancers. So yes, BH3-only proteins and at least Bax are tumor-suppressor genes and their loss can contribute to tumorigenesis.   </li>
<li>What else is altered in cancer cells? I just told you that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are often overexpressed and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins are often reduced in their expression. Are, for example, caspases altered? It turns out that when you look at the protein level of caspases in various types of tumors, you find that the level of specific caspases is often significantly reduced. For example, in about two thirds of biopsies from gastric cancers, the levels of caspase 2, 6 and 7 are significantly reduced.   </li>
<li>In the case of caspase-8, mutations have been detected in about 5-10% of invasive colorectal cancers and also advanced gastric cancers. And a reduction of caspase-8 expression has also been detected in about 25% of cases of childhood neuroblastomas. Therefore, the downregulation of caspase activity, through loss-of-function mutations or other alterations on expression levels, is also a feature that is commonly found in cancer cells.   </li>
<li>If you are interested in exploring this more and in exploring the contribution of genes of the central apoptotic pathway to human diseases other than cancer, I recommend that you go to NCBI and search for appropriate review articles. More and more data is becoming available concerning these questions in part through whole genome sequencing and exome sequencing. Furthermore, I only discussed with you the development of Bcl-2 inhibitors, the BH3-mimetics but there are of course other drugs being developed that target other proteins implicated in cancer such as signal transduction proteins and even caspase substrates. Again, if you are interested in exploring this more, search for appropriate literature.   </li>
<li>This is the end of week 6 and therefore the end of the course. I would like to thank the cell death community for doing such great work and for being a wonderful community to be part of. I also want to apologize actually to those colleagues, whose work I was not able to discuss or mention due to time constrains.  </li>
<li>I would also like to thank the three TAs of the course Sebastian, Saroj and Ryan. They did an outstanding job and without them, this course could not have happened. So, many thanks again to the three of you! And finally, I would like to thank all of you who hung out with us until the end. I hope you found this course useful for whatever purpose it may be. I hope that I could give you an overview of the field and the research which now allows you to continue to explore yourself. I also hope that you enjoyed it and that I was able to get across to you my fascination for this process. Good luck with the finals!   </li>
