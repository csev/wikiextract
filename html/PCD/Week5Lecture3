<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_5.2C_Lecture_3_-_Regulation_of_mammalian_Bad">Week 5, Lecture 3 - Regulation of mammalian Bad</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><p>In a couple of previous sections we talked about growth factors, these small secreted proteins that are important for cell-cell communication and that are important for processes such as cell survival.  Remember, when we discussed the experiment by Vaux, Cory and Adams that led to the realization that Bcl-2 overexpression can block apoptosis, we talked about the role of growth factors in the medium. The cells used by Vaux, Cory and Adams required the growth factor IL-3, which stand for interleukin 3. When grown in the presence of IL-3, the cells are happy and proliferate normally. However, after growth factor deprivation, the cells become very unhappy and undergo apoptosis so that after a couple of days almost all cells have died.  </p></li>
<li><p>Now that we have heard a lot about the apoptotic pathway in mammals, what could the molecular mechanism be for the observation that cells survive in the presence of IL-3 and that cells undergo apoptosis in the absence of IL-3? At least part of the answer is the sensors, the BH3-only proteins, and Bad in particular.  Korsmeyer and colleagues, who had identified Bax and Bad by searching for proteins that interact with Bcl-2, continued to look for factors that could interact with members of the Bcl-2 superfamily. So they also looked for proteins that could interact with Bad. What they identified is a protein called 14-3-3. And they could show that Bad and 14-3-3 indeed interact <i>in vivo</i>. </p></li>
<li><p>What are 14-3-3 proteins? 14-3-3 proteins are a family of regulatory proteins found in all eukaryotes that bind to many different signaling proteins. Currently, 200 diverse signaling proteins have been shown to bind to 14-3-3 proteins. </p></li>
<li><p>Signaling proteins refers to proteins that are involved in various signal transduction pathways. And signal transduction pathways are pathways that transfer signals from the outside of the cell through the plasma membrane into the cell, where they coordinate the response of that cell to a particular signal.  </p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly, it had also been shown that 14-3-3 proteins preferably bind to signaling proteins that are phosphorylated on either a serine residue or a threonine residue. For this reason, the question came up whether the interaction between 14-3-3 and Bad was dependent on Bad being phosphorylated?  </p></li>
<li><p>To address this question, a simpler one had to be answered first and that is whether Bad is phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i> in the first place? To answer that question, Korsmeyer and co-workers added some radio-actively labeled phosphate to the medium in which they grew their cells. Within the cells, this radioactively labeled phosphate (P32) is then incorporated into all kinds of molecules that are produced. Kinases are enzymes that can covalently attach a phosphate group (PO43-) to a protein. This reaction is also referred to as phosphorylation. The radio-actively labeled phosphate can, for example, be used by kinases to phosphorylate proteins. And through this phosphorylation, these proteins then become radioactively labeled.  </p></li>
<li><p>Using an antibody specific to Bad, Korsmeyer and colleagues then immuno-precipitated Bad protein from lysates generated from the radio-actively labeled cells ran the precipitate on a polyacrylamide gel and exposed the gel to a film to determine whether the Bad protein that was precipitated was radioactively labeled. And what they found is that yes, a fraction of the pool of Bad, maybe 10-20%, is phosphorylated.  </p></li>
<li><p>Using phosphoamino acid analysis they found that phosphorylation had occurred on serine residues of the Bad protein and sequencing of peptides of the Bad protein determined that phosphorylation had specifically occurred on serine residues 112 and 136 of the Bad protein.  In 1996, when this finding was reported in the journal Cell, this was the way that the phosphorylation status of a protein and the sites of phosphorylation in a protein were determined. Nowadays, this can all be done by mass spectrometery.  </p></li>
<li><p>What is the phosphorylation of Bad good for? Could it be that the phosphorylation status of Bad has something to do with how happy cells are? And with happy I refer to them not wanting to undergo apoptosis. So Korsmeyer and co-workers tested whether the presence or absence of growth factors had an effect on the phosphorylation status of Bad.  The cell line that they were working with was the same cell line that they had used for many of their studies on Bax and Bad. And this cell line is dependent on IL-3.  </p></li>
<li><p>What they found is that indeed IL-3 has an effect on Bad phosphorylation. In the presence of IL-3, much more phosphorylated Bad can be detected. This observation indicated that the presence of IL-3 somehow causes Bad to become phosphorylated. Apart from 14-3-3, Bad of course also can interact with the guardians of the Bcl-2 superfamily and with Bcl-XL, in particular.  </p></li>
<li><p>The next question now was whether the phosphorylation status of Bad - whether phosphorylated or not - affected the ability of Bad to interact with Bcl-XL and/or 14-3-3. The way they did this is by co-immunoprecipitations. They grew cells with or without IL-3 in the presence of radioactive phosphate, generated lysates from these cells and then used a Bcl-XL antibody to precipitate Bcl-XL.  And what precipitated with Bcl-XL was predominantly unlabeled Bad protein.  This observation indicated that Bcl-XL predominantly interacts with nonphosphorylated Bad. Furthermore, this interaction seemed to occur at membranes, most likely mitochondrial membranes.  </p></li>
<li><p>What about 14-3-3?  A similar experiment indicated that, in contrast to Bcl-XL, 14-3-3 predominantly interacted with phosphorylated Bad. Furthermore, rather than at membranes, this interaction seemed to occur in the cytoplasm.  These results together suggested that the phosphorylation status of Bad determines its interaction partner: that phosphorylated Bad interacts with 14-3-3 and that nonphosphorylated Bad interacts with Bcl-XL.  </p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, remember, the presence of the growth factor IL-3, which prevents the cells from undergoing apoptosis, causes Bad phosphorylation. Could it be that IL-3 prevents apoptosis in these cells by causing Bad phosphorylation, which then causes Bad to bind to 14-3-3 proteins rather than Bcl-XL?  </p></li>
<li><p>Is Bad phosphorylation basically "inactivating” Bad by sequestering it away to 14-3-3 proteins and thereby not allowing it to bind to Bcl-XL?  To obtain evidence for such a model, Korsmeyer and co-workers mutated serine residues 112 and 136 of Bad to residues that cannot be phosphorylated, in this case alanines.  If the model is correct,  nonphosphorylatable Bad protein should have more pro-apoptotic activity because it no longer can be phosphorylated and therefore no longer can be sequestered by 14-3-3 proteins.  </p></li>
<li><p>They first tested this mutant Bad protein for its ability to bind to Bcl-XL and to bind to 14-3-3 and as expected; the mutant protein still interacted with Bcl-XL. However, its binding to 14-3-3 proteins was much reduced.  They then expressed the wild-type or mutant, nonphosphorylatable Bad protein along with Bcl-XL in their IL-3-dependent cells and analyzed viability after IL-3 deprivation. And what they found supports the notion that the phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 and 136 is critical for the pro-apoptotic activity of Bad.  </p></li>
<li><p>What they found is that mutant Bad protein that cannot be phosphorylated killed faster than wild-type Bad.  In the case of wild-type Bad, 50% of the cells were still viable 20 hours after IL-3 deprivation.  In the case of mutant Bad, 50% of the cells were viable 8-9 hours after IL-3 deprivation.  And 20 hours after IL-3 deprivation only 2-3% of the cells were still alive.  These results demonstrated that the activity of the mammalian BH3-only protein Bad was controlled at the post-translational level through phosphorylation.  </p></li>
<li><p>The next question now was what kinase caused Bad phosphorylation in response to the presence of IL-3?  A few months after the paper on the interaction between Bad and 14-3-3 proteins and on Bad phosphorylation was published, a paper by Michael Greenberg and co-workers was published that reported the identification of a kinase that can phosphorylate Bad at serine 136. Michael Greenberg’s lab had been studying the kinase Akt. Akt is a component of the signal transduction pathway that transfers the signal from a number of different growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor, also called IGF, or platelet-derived growth factor, also called PDGF, into the cell to cause cell survival.  </p></li>
<li><p>It was just found that Akt likes to phosphorylate substrates that conform to a specific amino acid sequence, RXRXXS, (Arg-any-Arg-any-any-Ser) in particular.  Interestingly, the two phosphorylation sites in Bad, serine 112, and serine 136, conformed to this sequence. For this reason, Greenberg and co-workers put forward the hypothesis that Akt can phosphorylate Bad. And what they could show is that yes, indeed the Akt kinase can phosphorylate Bad at serine 136 <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, they could demonstrate that the entire signal transduction pathway, from the growth factor to the receptor and signaling components, were required for Akt-dependent Bad phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, they could show that the presence of IGF-1, the growth factor, and the activation of Akt, the kinase, can suppress Bad-mediated apoptosis <i>in vivo</i>.  And this suppression was dependent on Bad phosphorylation at serine 136.  With this work, which was published in the journal Cell in 1997, a pathway had been delineated for how growth factors block apoptosis thereby causing cell survival.  </p></li>
<li><p>Akt phosphorylates bad at serine 136. What about serine 112? About 15 years after these discoveries, we now know that Bad is a substrate not only of Akt but of a number of other kinases such as PKA (protein kinase A), S6K (ribosomal protein S6 kinase), and PAKs (p21 activated kinases). In addition, apart from serine 112 and 136, additional residues appear to be phosphorylated.  </p></li>
<li><p>Just earlier this year a paper came out in the journal Cell on the finding that IKK, the I kappaB kinase complex, which is mainly known for its role in a cell’s immune response and in inflammation, but which also affects cell survival, can phosphorylate Bad on serine 26. Just like phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 and 136, phosphorylation of Bad at serine 26 also results in Bad inactivation, and the loss of Bad’s pro-apoptotic activity.  Just like <i>C. elegans</i> <i>egl-1</i>, mammalian Bad therefore turns out to be an integrator of diverse apoptotic stimuli and survival stimuli, an integrator of stimuli that determine which cells will live and which cells will die.  However, in the case of <i>egl-1</i> the integration occurred at the level of transcription.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the case of Bad, the integration occurs at the level of post-translational modifications, and phosphorylation, in particular. Interestingly, the EGL-1 protein also has two sites that represent potential phosphorylation sites.  It is therefore feasible that EGL-1 activity is not only regulated at the transcriptional level but also at the post-translational level. However, we have so far not tested the role of these potential phosphorylation sites nor have we determined whether phosphorylation at these sites indeed occurs <i>in vivo</i>, in the worm.  </p></li>
