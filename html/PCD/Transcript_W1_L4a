<li>In the 1972 publication, Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie described the process of apoptosis at the morphological level. And discovered that this phenomenon was conserved. This represented a major step forward. Soon after, it was discovered that endonucleases and flippases are involved in apoptotic cell death. However, how do you go from these observations to the actual proteins and enzymes that function in apoptosis? How can you find them? What approaches can you take? </li>
<li>One powerful classical approach that one can take is a genetic approach. This approach involves the identification of individuals within a population that look or behave differently than the rest of the population. Most of the time, such differences in traits or phenotype as the geneticist refers to, are caused  by a single or a few changes to the DNA of that individual. These changes are often called mutations. Next week, for example, we will talk about genetic screens performed with the goal of finding mutant nematode worms with a defect in apoptosis. </li>
<li>The first protein identified with the role in apoptosis was discovered through cancer genetics. Normally, cells proliferate in a controlled manner, but not so with cancer. Cancer is a genetic disease, a disease that is caused by changes in the DNA of a single cell or a small population of cells which then proliferate in an uncontrolled manner and initiate tumorigenesis, the formation of a tumor. </li>
<li>Changes in the DNA that only occur in a small number of cells within the body and that are not also found in germ cells, are often referred to as somatic mutations. Changes to the DNA that cause various types of cancers often fall into this class of mutations. In contrast to somatic mutations, germ line mutations are found in the DNA of all cells of an organism, including the germ cells. </li>
<li>In the 1980s, it became possible to take tumor tissue removed from patients and to search for such cancer promoting or initiating changes in the DNA. One type of cancer for which this was done is Follicular lymphoma. What is Follicular lymphoma? Before I tell you what Follicular lymphoma is, I need to tell you something about the lymphatic System. </li>
<li>The lymphatic System is an important component of our immune system. It is composed of lymph nodes that are connected through lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are small oval shaped organs that are found throughout your body and that are connected throughout lymphatic vessels. The function of lymph nodes is to filter out foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses. For this reason, they are packed with immune cells such as B-cells and T-cells. Also part of the lymphatic System are organs such the tonsils, the thymus, the bone marrow and the spleen. </li>
<li>Lymphoma is a type of cancer that is referred to as blood cancer. It affects cells of the blood, and white blood cells in particular. White blood cells are cells of the immune system, such as B-cells and T-cells. In patients with lymphomas, the numbers of B-cells or T-cells found in the blood or the lymphatic System are dramatically increased. </li>
<li>Follicular lymphoma is a specific type of lymphoma that affects B-cells, which then invades specific organs of the lymphatic System such as lymph  nodes or the spleen. Affected lymph nodes and an affected spleen are shown in these images. </li>
<li>By the mid-1980s a number of investigators had succeeded in identifying a specific change in the DNA isolated from Follicular lymphomas. Interestingly, they found that this specific change had occurred not only in the tumor tissue isolated from one patient with Follicular lymphoma, but in the tumor tissues isolated from different patients with this type of lymphoma. </li>
<li>We now know that this specific change in the DNA is found in the tumor tissue of almost 80% of patients with Follicular lymphoma. This was an indication that this change in DNA is a functionally important one. And that it might be causal in the formation of Follicular lymphoma. </li>
<li>What is this change in the DNA? In turns out that in those B-cells that make up the tumor tissue, a translocation exists between two of the 23 different types of chromosomes found in the nucleus of every human cell. This translocation is between chromosomes 14 and 18. The lower arms of chromosomes 14 and 18 are basically switched. The switch most likely happened during the development or differentiation of a particular B-cell, which then give rise to the cancer. </li>
<li>Chromosomes are large pieces of DNA that contain the information for the synthesis of many proteins and molecules that basically make up the cells of our bodies and that make our body run. This information is packaged into genes. In the case of humans, about 25,000 different genes. </li>
<li>Each gene harbors the information to make one, sometimes more than one particular protein or molecule at the right time and at the right place. The next few slides summarize the basic components of such a gene or locus as it is sometimes also referred to, for a protein coding gene from a eukaryote, such as human. </li>
<li>First of all, there is the transcription unit, the part of the gene which is actually read, and transcribed from DNA into RNA. The RNA molecule generated contains the sequence information of the DNA from which it was transcribed from. </li>
<li>The transcription unit includes exons which are parts of the transcription unit that will later be included in the mature messenger RNA or mRNA. The exons may be coding, which means that their sequences will eventually be translated into amino acid sequence, and therefore, protein sequence. However, exons, or parts of exons, may also be non-coding, which means that their sequences will not be translated into protein sequence. </li>
<li>Also part of the transcription unit are introns. Introns are transcribed, however they will be removed, cutout basically, once the pre-mRNA gets processed. </li>
<li>Finally, untranslated regions, UTRs, are found at both ends of the  transcription unit. The five prime and the three prime end. UTRs are part of the five prime and three prime most exons and they are not coding, but they are important for the stability and localization of the mRNA. The initially formed RNA, called pre-mRNA, is then processed into mature mRNA which then is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where ribosomes then use the mRNA to synthesize a protein of a specific sequence. </li>
<li>Apart from the transcription unit, a gene also includes a promoter and cis-acting regulatory elements. </li>
<li>The promoter is important because it represents the site where the enzymatic machinery that makes pre-mRNA can dock to initiate transcription of the transcription unit. It is often located just before the start of the transcription unit. </li>
<li>Cis-regulatory elements are important to cause transcription of the transcription unit, at the right time and at the right place. </li>
<li>Enhancers are sites to which proteins can bind that activate the enzymatic machinery that causes transcription. This results then in the  initiation of pre-mRNA synthesis. </li>
<li>Conversely, silencers are sites to which proteins can bind that block enzymatic machinery that causes transcription. They are binding there for results in a block in pre-mRNA synthesis. </li>
<li>Enhancers and silencers, therefore determine at what time and in what cells transcription of a transcription unit takes place. They basically determine what we call the expression pattern of a gene. Whereas promoters are in general located just before the transcription enhancers and silencers can be located far away. Sometimes hundreds of thousands of bases away. In addition, they can be found before and after transcription units, as well as inside transcription units. Rather than before and after the transcription unit, one often refers to also as upstream and downstream of the transcription unit. </li>
<li>Altogether the transcription unit, the promoter and the cis-acting regulatory elements are a gene or a locus that contains the information necessary in our example for the generation of one mature mRNA and therefore, the synthesis of one particular protein.  </li>
