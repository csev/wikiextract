<li>The Bcl-2 protein has anti-apoptotic function. However, as I mentioned earlier, at the time Bcl-2 was discovered, its protein sequence did not reveal any enzymatic activities and did not provide any mechanistic insight. It was a small, novel protein of unknown function. It did however have a hydrophobic tail, which means that it potentially could associate with lipid bilayers through this tail. Knowing where Bcl-2 localizes within the cell might help elucidate how it can block apoptosis. </li>
<li>Not only cells are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, in this case the plasma embrane, but all major organelles that are found within eukaryotic cells. The nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi, the lysosomes, the mitochondria, all these organelles are surrounded by a lipid bilayer or membrane. </li>
<li>Which of these membranes does the Bcl-2 protein associate with through its hydrophobic tail? Bcl-2 associates with mitochondria and with the endoplasmic reticulum. As you will learn later, for its apoptotic function, the association with mitochondria appears to be very important. </li>
<li>What are mitochondria? Mitochondria are very interesting and important organelles. They originated from a bacterium, which at some point must have been phagocytosed by a eukaryotic cell. For this reason, mitochondria are actually surrounded by two membranes, an outer mitochondrial membrane and an inner mitochondrial membrane. The space inside the inner mitochondrial membrane is referred to as matrix and the space between the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane is referred to as inter-membrane space. Mitochondria also still have their own, small genome, another remnant of that bacterial cell that was at some point phagocytosed. </li>
<li>Mitochondria are very important because they are the power plant of the cell. They convert energy and generate ATP. However, mitochondria have additional functions and new functions are still being discovered. For example, mitochondria are important storage organelles for calcium ions and they are important for the synthesis of iron-sulfur-clusters, which are critical for the function of a number of proteins. They also appear to be a hub for cellular signaling pathways and they are important regulators of various aspects of metabolism. </li>
<li>Bcl-2 is found associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane through its hydrophobic tail and the rest of the Bcl-2 protein faces the cytoplasm. At the time, the localization of Bcl-2 to the outer mitochondrial membrane did not really help to answer the question how Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis. </li>
<li>Another approach to answer this question is to identify proteins that can physically interact with the protein of interest, in our case Bcl-2, in the hope that the sequences of the interacting proteins may provide clues about the mechanism or mechanisms through which Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis. And this is the approach that several investigators took in the late 1980's and early 1990's. </li>
<li>One way to identify interacting proteins is through co-immunoprecipitations from cell lysates.  What is necessary for this approach is an antibody that specifically binds to the protein of interest, in our case Bcl-2. An antibody is a protein complex generated by B cells that is either exhibited on the cell surface of the B cells or secreted by B cells and that recognizes and binds to one specific antigen, for example Bcl-2. By the way, the Ig heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 that is affected by the t(14; 18) translocation encodes for one of the proteins in the antibody protein complex. The antibodies are then coupled to tiny beads. </li>
<li>The other thing one needs is a cell lysate. A cell lysate is generated by gently opening up cells and organelles of, for example, cells grown in culture, and solubilizing them, basically making them into a liquid. This way most of the proteins and molecules within a particular type of cell become accessible. The actual experiment then is to add the Bcl-2 antibody coupled to beads to the cell lysate, to incubate the mixture for a while, and then to isolate the beads. The beads can be isolated or precipitated from the lysate simply by sedimentation or centrifugation. With the beads, two things should be isolated or precipitated along: First, the Bcl-2 protein, of course. However, only if there was Bcl-2 protein present in the cell lysate to start with. Second, any protein or proteins that directly or indirectly interact with the Bcl-2 protein. </li>
<li>This type of experiment is called co-immunoprecipitation because an antibody, a protein complex normally made by immune cells, the B cells, is used to isolate or precipitate the protein of interest and along with it, anything that binds. The Bcl-2 protein and any interacting protein can then be removed from the beads and separated by size using polyacrymalide gel-electrophoresis. The Bcl-2 protein can then be identified using a specific antibody, for example the Bcl-2 antibody. </li>
<li>Any protein co-precipitating with Bcl-2 can be identified by sequencing or mass spectrometry, methods that allow the determination of the amino acid or protein sequence of a protein of interest. Such a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was used by Korsmeyer and coworkers then at Washington University in St. Louis, to identify interactors of Bcl-2. They were successful, and in 1993, they published the first Bcl-2 interactor, Bax. And Bax stands for Bcl-2-associated X protein. For their co-immunoprecipitation, Korsmeyer and coworkers had in particular used lysate generated from the cell line RL-7, which is a cell line harboring the t(14;18) translocation. Maybe you can think of a reason, why they used this particular cell line for their experiment. </li>
<li>What is Bax? Does the sequence of the Bax protein reveal any specific functions or homologies? The sequence of Bax did not reveal any specific functions. However, it revealed weak homology to another protein. Of the thousands and thousands of proteins within mammalian cells, guess which one it shared some homology with? Bcl-2! The amino acid sequences of Bax and Bcl-2 are about 20% identical. 20% identical means that one out of five amino acids in the sequence of Bax is identical to the corresponding amino acid in Bcl-2. This is actually not very much. </li>
<li>What does Bax do? Does it also block apoptosis just like Bcl-2? To find out, Korsmeyer and colleagues generated cell lines in which they could express Bax using a viral promoter. They then tested the viability of the cells after the removal of growth factors. Remember, normal control cells die by apoptosis when the growth factors are removed from the medium in which they are cultured. In contrast, cells overexpressing Bcl-2 survive even in the absence of growth factors. </li>
<li>What Korsmeyer and colleagues found is that after growth factor removal, cells expressing Bax died even faster than control cells. What did this mean? It suggested that rather than blocking apoptosis, the Bax protein promotes or accelerates apoptosis. </li>
<li>Bax is a killer protein, a protein with pro-apoptotic function. Bax and Bcl-2 physically interact. What happens, if you express both proteins in cells? Who wins? They found that if they expressed less Bax than Bcl-2, about half of the cells still survived after growth factor deprivation. </li>
<li>However, if they expressed equal amounts of Bcl-2 and Bax, the cells died just like in the control cells. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax affects the rate of apoptosis. More Bcl-2 than Bax, cells survive. More Bax than Bcl-2, cells die. Furthermore, the fact that the Bcl-2 and Bax protein can interact with each other, form “heterodimers” as biochemists say, suggested that by binding to each other, Bcl-2 might block the pro-apoptotic activity of Bax or, alternatively, that Bax might block the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2.  </li>
<li>It turns out that Bcl-2 blocks the pro-apoptotic activity of Bax.  But more about this later. The identification of Bax was an important step, because it represented the first protein with pro-apoptotic activity. However, just like in the case of Bcl-2, the amino acid sequence of Bax did not reveal any molecular mechanism or mechanisms that these proteins might use to affect apoptosis.  </li>
<li>Korsmeyer and colleagues continued to search for interactors of Bcl-2. This time they used a different approach to identify such proteins. They used what is called the yeast two-hybrid system. Before I tell you what the yeast two-hybrid system is, I need to tell you something about transcription factors and transcriptional activators, in particular. </li>
<li>Remember when we talked about what a gene or a locus is and what it is composed of? We talked about proteins that bind to cis-acting elements and determine whether RNA is made from the transcription unit or not. These proteins are called transcription factors. And the transcription factors that bind to enhancers, the cis-acting elements that activate the general transcription machinery to synthesize RNA, are called transcriptional activators. Transcriptional activators often have two parts to them: a part that binds to the enhancer and therefore the DNA. This part is called the DNA-binding domain. </li>
<li>They also have a part which is called the activation domain. This domain is the domain that “speaks” to the general enzymatic machinery and activates it so that it makes RNA from the locus. What's interesting is that these two domains can be separated and can be fused to other proteins and confer either DNA-binding capability or activation capability to the protein they are fused to. </li>
<li>Now back to the yeast two-hybrid system. The Gal4 protein of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is such a transcriptional activator with a DNA binding domain and an activation domain. What is done for the two-hybrid system is that yeast cells are genetically engineered so that they synthesize a fusion protein composed of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the protein of interest, in our case, Bcl-2. This fusion protein is called the “bait.” In the yeast cells that express this bait, in a second step, one unique second fusion protein is now made at a time. This second fusion protein is composed of the Gal-4 activation domain and any one of the tens of thousands of proteins that, for example, the human genome codes for. This second fusion protein is called the “prey.” </li>
<li>Now, if the unique protein that is part of the prey is a protein that normally interacts with Bcl-2, this particular prey will interact with the bait, the Gal-4 DNA-binding domain-Bcl-2 fusion protein. This interaction brings into close vicinity the Gal-4 DNA binding domain and the Gal-4 activation domain and it results in the assembly of an active Gal-4 transcriptional activator. This activator can then bind to a specific enhancer in the DNA of these yeast cells and activate the expression of what is referred to as a “reporter gene,” a transcription unit that encodes a protein, whose presence within the yeast cells can easily be detected. </li>
<li>The yeast two hybrid system is called “two-hybrid system” because it depends on the use of two fusion proteins, the bait and the prey fusion, which are also referred to as hybrid proteins, also because they are  made of parts of different proteins that often come from different species, yeast and human, for example. </li>
<li>Using this yeast two-hybrid system and Bcl-2 as a bait, Korsmeyer and colleagues reported in 1995 the identification of another Bcl-2 interactor, Bad. What Bad stands for, I actually couldn't find in the original paper. Bad can interact with Bcl-2 but not with Bax, the killer protein. </li>
<li>What does Bad look like and what is its activity? At this point maybe not too surprising, Bad turns out to have some sequence similarity to Bcl-2 and also to Bax. However, this sequence similarity is mainly restricted to a part of the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins and this part is referred to as the BH3 domain. BH3 stands for Bcl-2 homology region 3. We will come back to this domain in a little while. </li>
<li>What does Bad do? Remember I told you that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein binds to the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and thereby antagonizes or blocks the ability of Bax to cause apoptosis. What Bad turns out to do is to bind to Bcl-2 thereby antagonizing Bcl-2's ability to bind to Bax. So when Bcl-2 binds to Bad, it no longer can interact with Bax and Bax becomes “free” to induce apoptosis. Bad is therefore also a pro-apoptotic protein since it can antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and therefore “activate” the pro-apoptotic Bax.  </li>
