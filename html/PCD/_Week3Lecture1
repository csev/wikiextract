<ul>
<li><p>The <i>C. elegans</i> genes <i>ced-3</i>, <i>ced-4</i> and <i>ced-9</i> can mutate to cause a general block in apoptosis. For this reason, they are components of the commitment step, during which cells irreversibly commit to the apoptotic fate. <i>ces-1</i> and <i>ces-2</i>, which can mutate to specifically block the deaths of the NSM sister cells, act in cell-death specification, the step before the commitment step, and <i>ced-1</i> and <i>ced-2</i>, which can mutate to block the engulfment of apoptotic corpses, act in the last step, the step during which cells are dismantled, phagocytosed and degraded.  </p></li>
<li><p>There is at least one more gene that can mutate to cause a general block in apoptosis and that, for this reason, is a component of this central commitment step. This gene is <i>egl-1</i>, the gene that we have heard of already in the last two sections. Dominant mutations in the <i>egl-1</i> gene were identified in screens for egg-laying defective mutants. A total of seven such dominant mutations came out of these screens. All these mutations cause the HSN neurons, which in hermaphrodites are required for egg laying, to inappropriately undergo programmed cell death.  </p></li>
<li><p>What could be the normal function of the <i>egl-1</i> gene? Since all seven mutations were dominant, this wasn’t clear. Could it be that the <i>egl-1</i> gene plays a role in sex determination and that the dominant <i>egl-1</i> mutations switch the sexual fate of the HSNs in hermaphrodites to that of males? Remember, the HSNs normally die in males. Or could it be that the <i>egl-1</i> gene is another cell-death specification gene, specifying the death of the HSNs?  </p></li>
<li><p>What was needed was a loss-of-function mutation of <i>egl-1</i>. And when I started my postdoc in Bob Horvitz’s lab, that’s what I wanted to search for. The approach I took was a reversion screen but the <i>egl-1</i> reversion screen was done a bit differently than the <i>ced-9(n1950)</i> reversion screen.  </p></li>
<li><p>When I started to work on <i>egl-1</i>, seven dominant <i>egl-1</i> mutations had been isolated and they all caused an Egl phenotype. However, some of these mutations were fully dominant whereas others were what is referred to as “semi-dominant”.  </p></li>
<li><p>A mutation is called fully dominant, if 100% of animals heterozygous for the mutation exhibit the mutant phenotype. And a mutation is called semi-dominant, if less than 100% of animals heterozygous for the mutation exhibit the mutant phenotype. In the case of the <i>egl-1</i> mutation <i>n1084</i>, for example, 100% of animals that are homozygous for <i>n1084</i> are Egl but only 71% of animals that are heterozygous for <i> n1084</i> are Egl.  </p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly, around 70% of animals heterozygous for <i>n1084</i> and a deficiency that deletes the <i>egl-1</i> locus on chromosome V are Egl as well. What this means is that, if one of the <i>n1084</i> alleles in a homozygous <i>n1084</i> strain is hit by a second mutation and if this second mutation converts the allele into a loss-of-function mutation, the animal should have about a 30% chance of being non-egg-laying defective.  </p></li>
<li><p>So the screen I did was the following. I mutagenized homozygous n1084 hermaphrodites with EMS and screened their F1 progeny for rare, nonEgl animals. I screened about 30,000 F1 animals and identified seven animals that were nonEgl, which was more than I had expected. Later I found out that all seven animals actually carried the same mutation, a 5 Base pair (bp) deletion. This deletion was most likely not induced by EMS but had arisen spontaneously in the <i>egl-1(n1084)</i> population that I had used for the screen.  </p></li>
<li><p>As we will see later, the <i>egl-1 </i> transcription unit is very small, significantly smaller in size than the average <i>C. elegans</i> transcription unit. And for this reason, it provides not a good target for EMS because there are just not many G:C base pairs that can mutate to have a significant, detectable effect on the function of the <i>egl-1</i> gene product. In retrospect, I probably would never have found what I was looking for, using EMS as a mutagen. So I was lucky that this spontaneous mutation had occurred.  </p></li>
<li><p>As I just mentioned, I found seven F1 animals that were no longer egg-laying defective. These animals were heterozygous for the <i>n1084</i> allele and the new, modified <i>n1084</i> allele that carries the second mutation. I homozygozed the allele referred to as <i>“n1084 n3082”</i> and analyzed the animals. Homozygous <i>n1084 n3082</i> animals looked like wild-type and they produced viable progeny. I furthermore found that the HSNs were present again in <i>n1084 n3082</i> hermaphrodites.  </p></li>
<li><p>So, what does <i>n3082</i>, the second mutation do? There were at least three possible explanations. First,<i> n3082</i> might revert the <i>n1084</i> allele back to the wild-type allele. In that case, <i>n1084 n3082</i> animals should be completely wild-type. Second, <i>n3082</i> might specifically block the death of the HSNs. In that case, the death of the HSNs but not other cells should be blocked in both hermaphrodites and males. And third,<i> n3082</i> might cause a general block in apoptosis. In that case the death of the HSNs as well as the deaths of many of the 131 cells that normally die should be blocked.  </p></li>
<li><p>To find out, I analyzed the pharynx of <i>n1084 n3082</i> animals using DIC microscopy and what I found was that there were on average 12 extra cells in the anterior pharynx. <i>n3082</i> therefore causes a general block in apoptosis. <i>n3082</i> also turns out to be recessive and therefore a loss-of-function mutation of the <i>egl-1</i> gene. These results demonstrate that <i>egl-1</i> gene is required for apoptosis.  </p></li>
<li><p>These results also demonstrated that, like the genes<i> ced-3, ced-4</i> and <i>ced-9</i>, the <i>egl-1</i> gene acts in the commitment step. There are four genes now acting in this step, three of them required for the apoptotic death of many of the 131 cells that normally die and that are therefore also referred to as “pro-apoptotic”, <i>ced-3</i>, <i>ced-4</i> and <i>egl-1</i>, and one gene whose normal function is to prevent apoptosis and that is therefore referred to as “anti-apoptotic” gene,<i> ced-9</i>. The loss of the pro-apoptotic genes causes a general block in apoptosis whereas the loss of the anti-apoptotic gene causes ectopic apoptosis, the opposite phenotype.  </p></li>
<li><p>What’s the order in which these 4 genes function? Is there an order? These genes are clearly involved in the same process, the commitment to the apoptotic fate, and some of them have opposite functions, pro- or anti-apoptotic functions. In addition, loss-of-function mutations are available and cause opposite phenotypes. What one can do to order gene function in this case is “double mutant” or “epistasis” analysis.  </p></li>
<li><p>What is epistasis? Epistasis is a form of gene interaction in which a mutation in <i>gene A</i> masks the phenotype caused by a mutation in <i>gene B</i>. In this case, <i>gene A</i> is said to be epistatic to <i>gene B</i>. And the implication of "epistasis" is a negative or antagonistic interaction of genes, in this case <i>gene A</i> and<i> gene B</i>, in some biochemical or developmental sequence.  </p></li>
<li><p>Double mutants were made between the genes that cause opposite phenotypes when inactivated. Double mutants were made basically carrying a <i>ced-9</i> loss-of-function mutation and either a loss-of-function mutation of <i>ced-3</i>, <i>ced-4</i> or <i>egl-1</i>. In the double mutants, cell death was then analyzed. Remember, the loss of <i>ced-9</i> function results in ectopic apoptosis and therefore embryonic lethality. The <i>ced-9; ced-3</i> double mutants were viable and they had a general block in apoptosis, a Ced phenotype. For this reason, the loss of  <i>ced-3</i> function “suppresses” or “masks” the loss of <i>ced-9</i> function and <i>ced-3</i> is therefore epistatic to <i>ced-9</i>. The same was found with <i>ced-4</i>. The <i>ced-9</i>; <i>ced-4</i> double mutants are viable and they have a Ced phenotype. The <i>ced-4</i> gene is therefore epistatic to <i>ced-9</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the case of <i>egl-1</i> however, the opposite was found. A <i>ced-9; egl-1</i> double is not viable and it still exhibits an ectopic apoptosis phenotype. For this reason, <i>ced-9</i> is epistatic to <i>egl-1</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>How does the knowledge of who is epistatic to whom help us to order gene function? The commitment step can be considered a regulatory pathway or cascade with two alternative states, ‘apoptosis’ or ‘no apoptosis’, like an ‘ON/OFF’ switch. In that case, "EPISTATIC" indicates "DOWNSTREAM".  </p></li>
<li><p><i>ced-4</i> and <i>ced-3</i> are epistatic to <i>ced-9</i>. The ectopic apoptosis induced by the loss of <i>ced-9</i> is dependent on a functional <i>ced-3</i> gene and on a functional<i> ced-4</i> gene. <i>ced-3</i> and <i>ced-4</i> therefore are required (or act downstream) of <i>ced-9</i> to cause apoptosis. Furthermore, <i>ced-9</i> normally acts to block the activity of<i> ced-3</i> and <i>ced-4</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, <i>ced-9</i> is epistatic to <i>egl-1</i>. The ectopic apoptosis induced by the loss of<i> ced-9</i> is not dependent on a functional <i>egl-1</i> gene. <i>egl-1</i> is therefore not required downstream of <i>ced-9</i> to cause apoptosis. Instead, it acts upstream of<i> ced-9</i> to block its anti-apoptotic function.  </p></li>
<li><p>Based on these genetic considerations, the functions of <i>ced-3</i>, <i>ced-4</i>, <i>ced-9</i> and <i>egl-1</i> can be ordered in the following genetic pathway. This is a genetic pathway and the interactions shown are between the genes’ functions. These interactions do not necessarily reflect physical interactions between the products of these genes.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt;Defining epistasis</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>One more note on epistasis and epistatic interactions. Remember that the first mutation in the <i>ced-3</i> gene, <i>n717</i>, was identified as a suppressor of the <i>ced-1</i> mutation <i>e1735</i>? The loss of <i>ced-3</i> masks the loss of <i>ced-1</i>, which means that <i>ced-3</i> is epistatic to <i>ced-1</i>. Based on what I just told you, that would mean that, in a genetic pathway, <i>ced-3</i> acts downstream of <i>ced-1</i>. However, I also told you that while <i>ced-3</i> acts in the central step of the apoptotic process )the step during which cells irreversibly commit to the apoptotic fate) <i>ced-1 </i>acts in the last step, the step during which cells are dismantled, engulfed and degraded.  How can it be that <i>ced-3</i> is epistatic to <i>ced-1</i>?  </p></li>
<li><p>The specification of which cells should live and die, the commitment of these cells to the apoptotic fate and their subsequent dismantling, engulfment and degradation are a sequence of cell biological and biochemical events, with one event being dependent on the successful completion of the previous one. A kind of “precursor/product” relationship exists between these different stages. For this reason, "EPISTATIC" indicates "UPSTREAM" in this case. The way I look at this is that if the commitment step is defective and no cells ever commit to the apoptotic fate, then it doesn’t matter whether engulfment works or not. In other words, when you are working with genes that are components of what can be considered a regulatory cascade with an ON/OFF switch, such as the commitment step, then in a double mutant, you will see the phenotype caused by the genes that acts closest to the actual switch. Epistatic therefore means downstream. </p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, when you are working with genes that are components of different steps that act sequentially and that each are dependent on the completion of the previous step, in a double mutant, you will see the phenotype caused by the gene that acts most upstream since once blocked, the cascade is interrupted and cannot proceed to the next step. When you are performing epistasis analyses, you therefore should make sure that you know what kind of a cascade or processes you are looking at.  </p></li>
<li><p>One note, the term epistasis is nowadays used by quantitative geneticists in a somewhat different way. It can be used to describe any non-additive phenotypic effects seen in individuals with a specific genotype.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slide&gt;&gt;The commitment step of apoptosis</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Now coming back to the genetic pathway of the commitment step.  The loss of <i>ced-3</i> or <i>ced-4</i> causes a general block in apoptosis, and they both act downstream of <i>ced-9</i>. For this reason, the order of these two genes could not be resolved )at least not using loss-of-function mutations). Once the two genes were cloned and identified, they were individually overexpressed in cells in <i>C. elegans</i> that normally survive. And what was found is that both could induce ectopic cell death.  </p></li>
<li><p>This provided an assay to determine whether <i>ced-4</i>-induced ectopic cell death was dependent on a functional <i>ced-3</i> gene and, vice versa, whether <i>ced-3</i>-induced ectopic cell death was dependent on a functional <i>ced-4</i> gene. The result of these studies was that the overexpression of <i>ced-3</i> can induce apoptosis in the absence of <i>ced-4</i> whereas <i>ced-4</i> is unable to induce apoptosis in the absence of <i>ced-3</i>. The conclusion from this result is that<i> ced-4</i> acts upstream of <i>ced-3</i> to activate <i>ced-3</i> and that <i>ced-3</i> activation can be sufficient to commit cells to the apoptotic fate, to trigger the switch, basically.  </p></li>
<li><p>Here now is the genetic pathway of the commitment step. It is a simple linear pathway with four components.  The interactions between these four components are either negative or antagonistic as between<i> egl-1</i> and <i>ced-9</i> or <i>ced-9</i> and <i>ced-4</i> or positive or activating as between <i>ced-4</i> and <i>ced-3</i>. Based on this pathway, one can predict the activities of the genes.  </p></li>
<li><p>For example, when the most upstream component of the pathway, <i>egl-1</i>, is active, then <i>ced-9</i> should be inactive, <i>ced-4</i> active, and <i>ced-3</i> active. This should lead to a commitment to the apoptotic fate and therefore death. Conversely, when <i>egl-1</i> is inactive, then <i>ced-9</i> should be active, <i>ced-4</i> inactive and also <i>ced-3</i> inactive. This should not lead to a commitment to the apoptotic fate.</p></li>
