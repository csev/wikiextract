<ul>
<li>Bcl-2, Bax and Bad were the first members of the Bcl-2 superfamily identified in mammals. Now in 2013, many more have been identified and they are shown here. The Bcl-2 superfamily is divided into three subgroups, represented by the three different colors. </li>
<li>First there are the sensors. These have pro-apoptotic activities and Bad was the first member of this subgroup that was identified. In mammals, there are now at least eight sensors. Most sensors have a hydrophobic tail and all have a BH3 domain. The BH3 domain is the domain of the protein that is necessary for the ability of the sensors to bind to the anti-apoptotic guardians, such as Bcl-2. This domain is therefore also called the ligand domain. Apart from the BH3-domain, the sensors show no significant homology to members of the other subgroups or to themselves. </li>
<li>The second subgroup is the guardians. These have anti-apoptotic activities and Bcl-2 was the first member of this subgroup that was identified. There are six of these anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins in mammals. All guardians have a hydrophobic tail and all share four regions of homology, the BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 domain. The region of Bcl-2 including the BH3, BH1, and BH2 domain is also referred to as the “receptor” domain because it is required for the interaction between the guardians and the sensors. </li>
<li>By the way, viruses invade cells in order to exploit the cellular machinery within those cells for their own reproduction. Some viruses make proteins that look and act like the mammalian guardians. Why do you think they are making such proteins?  </li>
<li>Finally, there are the effectors, Bax and Bak. Bax and Bak also have a hydrophobic tail and a BH1, BH2, and BH3 domain. However, they are missing the BH4 domain. Why are the subgroups called sensors, guardians, and effectors? </li>
<li>In the previous section, we talked about the identification of Bax and Bad. Members of the Bcl-2 superfamily can interact with each other and form heterodimers. Through their interactions, they can antagonize their functions. And the model that was put forward early on and that is referred to as the indirect activation model is that Bax and Bak are the effectors, they are the ones that can induce apoptosis. However, if they are bound to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins such as Bcl-2 proteins, “guardians” basically, then they are blocked in their ability to induce apoptosis. </li>
<li>The role of the pro-apoptotic sensors is to bind to the anti-apoptotic guardians and to prevent them from blocking the effectors. The sensors are called sensors because, as we will see later, they indeed act as sensors and also integrators of the pro- and anti-death signals that cells are constantly exposed to. The regulatory pathways that specifies whether a cell should die or not merge at the sensors and control their activities. The sensors therefore represent a very important level of regulation in apoptosis. However, what happens in vivo, in cells, might not be as simple as sensors binding to guardians and guardians binding to effectors, as shown here (indirect activation model). </li>
<li>Some sensors might not only be able to bind to guardians and therefore activate effectors indirectly but they might form heterodimers with effectors and therefore activate them directly as well. This is referred to as the direct activation model. Finally, there is evidence that sensors actually do two things. There is evidence that, first, they get the effectors ready or primed. In the case of Bax, this involves a change in the structure of Bax, which exposes its hydrophobic tail and causes Bax to re-localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Remember, that's where Bcl-2 and actually most of the Bcl-2-like proteins are located. </li>
<li>Once at the outer mitochondrial membrane, the effectors are bound and blocked by the guardians, for example Bcl-2. In a second step then, the sensor Bad, in particular, binds to the guardian thereby displacing the effector from the guardian. The effector then can induce apoptosis. Which model is correct? They might all be correct depending on the organism, the cell type and the specific context one is looking at. What they all have in common is that members of the different subgroups interact and form heterodimers and that their interaction causes changes in their apoptotic functions. </li>
<li>Coming back to the different subgroups of the Bcl-2 superfamily in mammals, why is there not only one sensor, one guardian and one effector? Why do you think there are several of each type? Based on the models we just discussed, some of the sensors might actually have slightly different functions and that might be the reason why there are at least eight of them in mammals. In addition, it turns out that not all sensors, guardians and effectors are always expressed in all of our cells, tissues and organs. They might also not all be expressed throughout development and adult life. </li>
<li>However, the fact is that some do have overlapping functions and overlapping expression patterns. So why is that? Is there an advantage? Yes there is. And that is called redundancy. Having more than one sensor, more than one guardian, and more than one effector expressed in a cell at a certain time makes the system more safe and robust. </li>
<li>Imagine that, for whatever reason, one of the sensors doesn't get made or doesn't work. Then you have the second one there, the replacement sensor, to do the job. If the replacement sensor was not there, the effectors would not be activated and a cell that should die, would fail to die. This would not be good for the organism, especially, if the cell that should have died is injured or toxic and therefore potentially harmful. To have proteins with redundant functions is good for the organism, but it makes the analysis of these proteins and the genes that code for them harder. </li>
<li>The two effectors, Bax and Bak, are a good example for that. Bax and Bak both were identified as interactors of guardians, both are expressed pretty much in all tissues and during all developmental stages, and both were shown to, when overexpressed in cell lines, induce apoptosis. The overexpression of a protein in a system, such as cell lines, represents the protein's gain-of-function phenotype and it is somewhat of an artificial experimental set-up. What is the more rigorous test of a protein's normal in vivo function is to determine its loss-of-function phenotype. </li>
<li>What happens to the organism when you destroy or delete the gene that codes for the protein of interest? Mice were generated that lack the gene that codes for Bax. These mice are referred to as Bax knock-out mice. The expectation was that in those mice, apoptosis should be blocked, because the Bax protein can no longer be made. However, that was not the case. The bax knock-out mice showed a very mild phenotype, some mild phenotype in the lymphatic system and some mild phenotype in male germ cells. Much of apoptosis that occurs during development and throughout adult life, still happened just fine. This rather disappointing phenotype was published in 1995, two years after Bax had been identified. What had not been identified when the Bax knock-out was made was Bak, the second effector. Bak was published in 1995 and knocked-out in 2000. The Bak knock-out mice also had almost no phenotype. </li>
<li>Could Bax and Bak have redundant functions? The double knock-out was generated, a mouse line lacking both genes, and the result confirmed that yes, Bax and Bak have redundant functions. The double knock-out mice have a severe phenotype and most of the embryos die due to multiple developmental defects. For example, these mice have persistent webs of skins between their digits and show an excess of cells in the nervous system and the immune system. Apoptosis is largely blocked in these mice. </li>
<li>This finding demonstrated two important things: First, Bax and Bak have redundant functions and second, Bax and Bak are required for apoptosis in vivo. Not only the functions of Bax and Bak turn out to be redundant, but also the functions of some of the sensors and some of the guardians. This has made it challenging to dissect the function of the proteins genetically in vivo. Organisms simpler than mammals often show less redundancy. Often, rather than several genes with the same or similar functions, they only have one gene with that function. </li>
<li>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans  is such a simpler organism. In the next section, we will see how genetic studies in C. elegans helped to set a genetic frame work for apoptosis.  </li>
