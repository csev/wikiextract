<ul>
<li><p>With the identification of <i>ced-3 </i> and <i>ced-4 </i> in 1986 and of <i>ced-9 </i> in 1992, the “worm” <i>C. elegans </i> had been established as a model for apoptosis studies. David Vaux, who had demonstrated in 1988 that human Bcl-2 can block apoptosis, became interested in determining whether the expression of human Bcl-2 in <i>C. elegans</i> similarly could block apoptosis. Why did he want to do that?  </p></li>
<li><p>While <i>C. elegans</i> genes had been identified, whose functions are required either for blocking apoptosis or for inducing apoptosis, the genes had not been cloned yet and their gene products were therefore unknown. For this reason, it was unclear at the time whether the apoptotic process that investigators like David Vaux were studying in mammalian cells and that  investigators like Bob Horvitz were studying in <i>C. elegans</i> were really the same processes and conserved at the molecular level.  </p></li>
<li><p>The question basically was whether similar proteins and molecules were involved in the apoptotic process in mammals and worms. To test whether the expression of human bcl-2 in <i>C. elegans</i> could block the death of the 131 cells that normally die during <i> C. elegans</i> development, David Vaux and colleagues at Stanford University generated a <i>C. elegans</i> line transgenic for a reporter construct that allowed the expression of the bcl-2 transcription unit under the control of a heat-inducible promoter. Using a shift in temperature, he could then induce broad expression of bcl-2 in <i>C. elegans</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>How do you generate transgenic lines in <i>C. elegans</i>? The traditional way is the following: You take your plasmid of interest and a co-injection marker, a plasmid that expresses something that you can easily detect or assay for, and you inject these plasmids into the gonads of hermaphrodites.  Inside the gonads, the plasmids will be taken up by some of the oocytes that are generated. In these oocytes, the plasmids are made into what is referred to as “extra-chomosomal arrays”. Extra-chromosomal arrays are like mini chromosomes that can contain anywhere from 30-300 copies of the injected plasmids. In general, one therefore looks at the overexpression of the plasmid and therefore transcription unit of interest.  </p></li>
<li><p>Since the extra-chromosomal arrays do not have what normal chromosomes have, such as centromeres, they do not always get segregated properly into the daughter cells during cell division. They often get lost. That’s why only a few of the progeny generated from the injected animals will actually carry the extra-chromosomal arrays and not all cells in these animals will actually carry it. The animals are therefore “mosaic”. Furthermore, only a few transgenic F1 animals will carry the extra-chromosomal array in their germ line and will therefore pass on the extra-chromosomal array to some of their progeny. Those clones that do are referred to as “transgenic line”.  </p></li>
<li><p>I should mention that nowadays, there are other ways to make transgenic <i>C. elegans</i> Low-copy arrays for example can be generated by bombarding <i>C. elegans</i> with a gene gun and targeted, single-copy integration into the genome can be done using a transposon-based method. </p></li>
<li><p>Now back to the expression of human bcl-2 in <i>C. elegans</i>.  David Vaux actually used<i> ced-1</i> mutant animals to generate the transgenic lines. Why did he use <i> ced-1</i> mutant animals and not just wild-type animals? He used<i> ced-1</i> mutant animals for the same reason that Hillary Ellis and Bob Horvitz had used<i> ced-1</i> mutant animals for their first screen. In an engulfment defective background, apoptotic corpses persist for a long time and you can therefore analyze and quantify cell death that occurred over an entire developmental period, for example through embryogenesis, and not just at one particular time point.  </p></li>
<li><p>And what David Vaux observed in transgenic animals, which he had shifted to a higher temperature to induce <i>bcl-2</i> expression is a significant reduction in the number of persistent apoptotic corpses. In animals that carried a control plasmid or in animals that were not shifted to the higher temperature, he found on average around 40 apoptotic corpses. However, in the animals that carried the bcl-2 plasmid and that were shifted to the higher temperature, he found on average only 16 apoptotic corpses, less than half the number. What could explain the lower number of apoptotic corpses?  </p></li>
<li><p>It could be the result of fewer cells dying or it could reflect a decrease in apoptosis. However, it could also reflect the suppression of the <i>ced-1</i> engulfment defect.  To rule out this possibility, David Vaux analyzed how long the corpses that he detected in the <i>bcl-2 </i> expressing animals persisted. He found that they persisted as long as in <i>ced-1</i> control animals. This suggested that the lower number of corpses seen in the <i>bcl-2</i> corpses seen in the <i>bcl-2</i> expressing animals was a result of a decrease in the number of cells that had died. Basically, many of the 131 cells that normally die during <i>C. elegans</i> development no longer died.  </p></li>
<li><p>This finding, which was published by Vaux and colleagues in the journal Science in 1992, shortly after the identification of <i>ced-9</i> was published in the journal Nature was very significant. It was significant because it demonstrated that the human bcl-2 protein can block apoptosis in <i>C. elegans</i>. Since proteins don’t act alone but in networks and pathways, it furthermore suggested that a pathway exists in <i>C. elegans</i> in which the <i>bcl-2</i> protein can act to block apoptosis.  </p></li>
<li><p>This finding was therefore the first hint that an apoptosis pathway exists that is conserved from worms to humans. bcl-2 can block apoptosis in mammals.  Similarly,<i>ced-9</i> can block apoptosis in <i>C. elegans</i> <i>bcl-2</i> can also block apoptosis in <i>C. elegans</i>. In their discussion, Vaux and colleagues state: ”the genetic behavior of <i>ced-9</i> is the most similar to that of bcl-2” They do not go as far as proposing that <i>ced-9</i> might be the ortholog of bcl-2. However, they do speculate that: “As <i>ced-9</i> appears to act by inhibiting <i>ced-3</i> and <i>ced-4</i> activity, bcl-2 most likely works in humans by antagonizing the activity of homologs” (Vaux et al., 1992, Science, 258:1955-1957).  </p></li>
<li><p>Do the bcl-2 and <i>ced-9</i> genes encode similar proteins? The<i> ced-9</i> gene needed to be cloned! And this was done by Michael Hengartner in Bob Horvitz’s lab, who had identified and characterized the <i>ced-9</i> mutants.</p></li>
