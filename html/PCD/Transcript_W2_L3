<ul>
<li>In the 1980's Bob Horvitz and co-workers at MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts started to do forward genetic screens for <em>C. elegans</em> mutants with defects in the invariant pattern of cell death. What were they looking for and what did they use as an assay? </li>
<li>First, what where they looking for? They thought that, if there are genes that are required for the 131 cells to die, then it should be possible to find animals homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in these genes by looking for mutants in which at least some of these 131 cells no longer died. And that's what they were looking for. </li>
<li>What did they use as an assay? Of the 131 cells that die during <em>C. elegans</em> development, 113 die during embryogenesis. However, when you look at an embryo by DIC microscopy, you only see a handful of these apoptotic corpses, even if you scan the entire embryo. That's because as I mentioned earlier, in <em>C. elegans</em>, cells die very quickly and the cell corpses are swiftly engulfed and degraded. They don't persist. And that's why at any given time during embryonic development, you only see a few corpses.  </li>
<li>The small number of corpses you see make it hard to look for mutants, in which some of these cells no longer die. To look for fewer corpses in embryos by DIC microscopy was therefore not a good assay.  </li>
<li>Fortunately, a few years earlier, in 1983, Hedgecock, Sulston and Thompson, at the MRC LMB in Cambridge, UK, had identified two recessive mutations that cause a block in the engulfment of the 131 cells that died. They called the phenotype that these two mutations cause cell-death abnormal or Ced phenotype. And they named the genes that these two mutations define ced-1 and ced-2 , the first and second gene identified in <em>C. elegans</em> that can mutate to cause a cell-death-abnormal phenotype.  </li>
<li>Just a note, at the time, the genes ced-1 and ced-2 were defined only by these mutations. Where in the <em>C. elegans</em> genome they were located and what their gene products were was unknown. It took years before - using genetic mapping and rescue experiments - these two genes were cloned and their identities determined. And this is true for the mutations and genes that we will talk about today and in the next couple of sections as well.  </li>
<li>In ced-1 and ced-2 mutants, apoptotic corpses are not engulfed. These two genes are therefore required for one aspect of the last step in apoptosis, the engulfment of the apoptotic corpses. What happens to these unengulfed corpses? They persist for a long time.  </li>
<li>And this can easily be seen in L1 larvae by DIC microscopy. In wild-type L1 larvae, there are no apoptotic corpses visible in the anterior region or head region of the animal.  </li>
<li>In contrast, in ced-1 or ced-2 mutant L1 larvae, there are 20-30 apoptotic corpses in this region. It is really easy to see and there are lots of those corpses! This is a great assay! It allows you to screen for mutants in which there are fewer of these corpses. For this reason, rather than mutagenizing wild-type hermaphrodites, Horvitz and co-workers mutagenized ced-1 mutant hermaphrodites, and they used hermaphrodites homozygous for the ced-1 allele e1735, in particular.  </li>
<li>They allowed the P0s to reproduce, as well as their F1 generation. The resulting F2 generation, they then screened as L1 larvae and they screened for L1 larvae that had fewer apoptotic corpses in the head region. They screened the F2 generation of a total of 4,000 F1 animals. If there is a gene, which when mutated, can block the death of the 131 cells, then the progeny of 4,000 F1 animals should be enough to identify at least a couple of loss-of-function mutations of this gene.  </li>
<li>Hillary Ellis, who performed the screen, identified two independent F2 animals, basically two F2 animals from different clones, that had no apoptotic corpses in their head regions in the L1 stage. The two mutations that she had identified were named n717 and n718 because they were the 717th and 718th mutations identified in the Horvitz lab at MIT.  </li>
<li>Both mutations turned out to be recessive, which means that the disappearance of the apoptotic corpses in the head of ced-1 mutant L1 larvae was only observed in animals that were homozygous for either n717 or n718. n717 and n718, therefore most likely represented loss-of-function mutations of some unknown genes.  </li>
<li>Because both mutations behaved the same in all the analyses that Hillary Ellis subsequently did, I will therefore, for now, just focus on n717. What could cause the phenotype observed in the ced-1(e1735); n717 double mutants? Again, ced-1(e1735) causes persistent apoptotic corpses in the L1 stage. In the double mutants, persistent corpses are no longer present.  </li>
<li>There are at least three different scenarios that could explain this phenotype. Think about it for a couple of minutes.<br />
<ul><li><ul><li> First, in the mutants identified, engulfment might take place again, which means that the apoptotic corpses are engulfed during embryogenesis and no longer persist in L1 larvae.<br />
</li><li> Second, in the mutants identified, the 131 cells that normally die might not be generated.<br />
</li><li> And third, in the mutants identified, the 131 cells that normally die might be generated however, they might fail to die and instead, inappropriately survive.  </li>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<li>To determine whether cells are engulfed again, Hillary Ellis looked at ced-1(e1735); n717 embryos by DIC microscopy. And what she didn't find were apoptotic corpses. For this reason she concluded that n717 does not reactivate the engulfment process. Otherwise, she would have seen apoptotic corpses in the embryos. The first possibility was therefore ruled out.  </li>
<li>To distinguish between the second and third possibilities, Hillary Ellis performed lineage analyses. She basically followed parts of the development of n717 animals to determine whether the 131 cells that normally die were generated in the mutants and if so, what their fates were. For this experiment she had crossed the ced-1 mutation e1735 out of the n717 mutant background. She therefore analyzed n717 in an otherwise wild-type background.  </li>
<li>What she found was striking. The 131 cells were generated; however, they did not undergo any of the morphological changes typical for apoptotic cells. They looked like other cells that are not programmed to die.  </li>
<li>Furthermore, the 131 undead cells persisted and survived throughout the animals' lives. We now know that many of these undead cells adopt a neuronal fate, which is the fate of their sisters. And not only do they adopt the neuronal fate, they often develop into fully functional neurons.  </li>
<li>These findings were significant for a number of reasons:<br />
<ul><li><ul><li> First, the lineaging data revealed that what is defective in the n717 mutant animals is cell death, apoptosis. As I mentioned earlier, n717 is recessive and therefore most likely a loss-of-function mutation. The loss of the gene that is defined by n717 therefore causes a block in apoptosis. From this observation one can conclude that this gene is normally required for apoptosis. Hillary Ellis had done the screen under the assumption that there might be genes required for apoptosis. At the time, in 1986, when this seminal work was published in the journal <em>Cell</em>, no such gene had been identified yet in any system. Their work proved that such genes exist, at least in <em>C. elegans</em>.<br />
</li><li> Second, n717 mutant animals are alive, at least in the laboratory setting. This meant that a block in apoptosis in <em>C. elegans</em> is NOT detrimental to <em>C. elegans</em>' development or to its viability. As we know now, this is not the case for most other multicellular animals. A block in apoptosis leads to a block in development in the case of all other animal models, the fruit fly, the zebrafish, the mouse and, of course, also in the case of humans. The fact that <em>C. elegans</em> mutants with a block in apoptosis are alive has made the genetic dissection of this process in this model organism easier. 
</li><li> Finally, the fact that Ellis and Horvitz could demonstrate that genes required for apoptosis exist and that animals mutant for these genes have a defect that is quite specific, a block in apoptosis, rather than very broad and pleiotropic, suggested that there is a genetic pathway that is specifically involved in and required for apoptosis in <em>C. elegans</em> and potentially also in higher animals. </li>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<li>Now, coming back to the second mutation that Hillary Ellis had identified, n718. Are n717 and n718 mutations in the same gene and therefore allelic or are they mutations in two different genes? Basically, do they define one or two genes? How can you figure this out? You do something referred to as a complementation test.  </li>
<li>This test can be done with recessive mutations, which n717 and n718 are. You take hermaphrodites homozygous for one of the mutations, let's say n717, and males homozygous for the other mutation, n718. You mate them and analyze the cross progeny.  </li>
<li>If n717 and n718 are mutations in the same gene, the F1 progeny will still be homozygous mutant for that locus and therefore exhibit the mutant phenotype in our case a Ced phenotype. However, if n717 and n718 are mutations in two different genes, then, the F1 progeny will be heterozygous for both loci because the parents were homozygous mutant for only one of the two loci and therefore contributed the wild-type allele for the second locus. The F1 progeny will therefore not exhibit a mutant phenotype.  </li>
<li>It turns out that n717 and n718 are different mutations in the same gene, which was named ced-3, the third gene in <em>C. elegans</em> that can mutate to cause a defect in cell death, this time a general block in apoptotic cell death. Is the ced-3 gene the only gene in <em>C. elegans</em> that can mutate to cause a block in apoptosis? Ellis and Horvitz continued to screen however this time, with an even better assay. </li>
<li>To explain this assay, I need to tell you something about dominant mutations of the gene egl-1 and egl stands for egg-laying defective. As the name implies, hermaphrodites carrying these mutations are unable to lay eggs.  </li>
<li>How do hermaphrodites lay eggs in the first place? On their ventral side, in the midbody region, hermaphrodites have a vulva, which is an opening through which the eggs are laid. The vulva opens periodically to release about 3-4 eggs or embryos an hour. The opening of the vulva is caused by the vulval muscles and those are under the control of neurons, most importantly the HSNs or hermaphrodite-specific neurons, two serotonergic neurons.  </li>
<li>If the HSN neurons are not functional or are not present, the vulval muscles are not activated and the vulva cannot open to release eggs. The eggs therefore accumulate inside the animal. The HSNs are very interesting neurons because they are sexually dimorphic. They are sexually dimorphic because of apoptosis. The HSNs are generated in both hermaphrodites and males; while they survive in hermaphrodites, they are eliminated again by apoptosis during embryogenesis in males.  </li>
<li>Dominant mutations in the gene egl-1 cause the HSN neurons in hermaphrodites to inappropriately undergo apoptosis, resulting in adult hermaphrodites with no HSNs. These hermaphrodites therefore cannot properly lay eggs. Wild-type, non-Egl animals have about 10-15 eggs inside their body. </li>
<li>However, egl-1 animals accumulate 50-60 eggs inside their body and this can easily be detected with a dissecting or stereo-microscope. What this means is that to look at the Egl phenotype, animals don't have to be mounted on glass slides and viewed at a 1000-fold magnification using a compound microscope equipped with DIC, as is the case for looking at apoptotic corpses in embryos or larvae. The Egl phenotype is therefore a very convenient assay for forward genetic screens. </li>
<li>During their analysis of the ced-3 mutations n717 and n718, Hillary Ellis had made a double mutant with one of the dominant egl-1 mutations. And what she found is that these double mutant animals, ced-3(n717); egl-1(n1084dm) for example, were no longer egg-laying defective. They were no longer egg-laying defective because the HSN neurons survived again.  </li>
<li>This meant that a general block in apoptosis, as conferred by the loss of ced-3 function, suppressed the Egl phenotype caused by egl-1(n1084dm). That was great because what it meant is that the Egl phenotype of egl-1(n1084dm) animals could be used as an easy read-out for apoptosis. Apoptosis functional Egl phenotype apoptosis defective - No Egl phenotype - and this is what they used for their second screen for mutants with a general defect in apoptosis. egl-1(n1084) animals were mutagenized and their F2 progeny screened for non-egg-laying defective animals, basically animals that could lay eggs again. One non-Egl F2 animal was identified that was homozygous for a recessive mutation, which was named n1162.  </li>
<li>In egl-1(n1084); n1162 homozygous animals, the HSNs as well as most of the 131 cells that normally die survive. Is n1162 allelic to n717 and n718 and therefore another allele of the ced-3 gene? Through complementation analysis, it was determined that n1162 is not a new allele of ced-3. For this reason, n1162 defined a new gene, which was named ced-4. ced-4 represented a second <em>C. elegans</em> gene, which when mutated can cause a general block in apoptosis.  </li>
<li>Since ced-3 and ced-4 are required for many of the 131 cell deaths that occur during <em>C. elegans</em> development, they are components of the commitment step during which specific cells, the 131 cells, are irreversibly committed to the apoptotic fate.   </li>
