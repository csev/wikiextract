<ul>
<li>I mentioned earlier that the cell death field distinguishes programmed cell death and necrosis. Programmed cell death is subdivided even further into programmed cell death type I, also referred to as apoptosis, and programmed cell death type II, also referred to as autophagic cell death. Autophagic cell death was only discovered a few years ago and most of the work done so far has focused on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Since we don't know as much about autophagic cell death yet, we will focus on apoptosis. </li>
<li>What does apoptosis mean? The word apoptosis comes from the Greek and describes the falling off of petals from flowers or the falling off of leaves from trees. The term was coined in 1972 in a seminal paper published by Kerr, Wyllie and Currie, three investigators at the University of Aberdeen, who were studying cell death. I recommend that you look at this paper not only because the term apoptosis is used for the first time in this publication but because Kerr, Wyllie and Currie recognized the importance of this process and proposed that it plays a complementary but opposite role to mitosis. </li>
<li>Here is an excerpt from their publication: “and we suspect that further work will confirm it as a general mechanism of controlled cell deletion, which is complementary to mitosis in the regulation of animal's cell populations. Because of its important kinetic significance we suggest that it be called Apoptosis” The abstract and the conclusions of the paper summarize the state of the field in 1972 and are an excellent read. On a side note, what I like about the paper is that in a footnote on page 3, it also provides instructions on how to pronounce apoptosis. They recommend that the second p is a silent p and that you say apotosis rather than apoPtosis. Have a look. Kerr, Wyllie and Currie were not the first investigators to observe apoptosis. </li>
<li>In the 19th century, two German scientists, Vogt and Flemming, observed what most likely was apoptosis. However, their initial observations and descriptions of the process were not followed up until in 1965, Kerr rediscovered apoptosis and together with his colleagues Wyllie and Currie initiated studies that eventually led to their 1972 publication. In this 1972 paper, Kerr, Wyllie and Currie also report the first comprehensive characterization of the apoptotic cell death process at the electron-microscopic level, which allows the detailed analysis of sub-cellular organelles and structures. Figure 5 of their paper summarizes their findings. </li>
<li>The first morphological change that can be observed is that the cell that will eventually undergo apoptosis, separates from the tissue and loses contacts with its neighboring cells. The doomed cell then shrinks and the cytoplasm and chromatin condense. Due to the condensed chromatin, the nucleus changes its appearance to what is sometimes referred to as pyknotic nucleus. </li>
<li>In a next step, apoptotic cells often fragment into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. Along with the remaining corpse, these apoptotic bodies are subsequently phagocytosed or engulfed by professional phagocytes such as macrophages. Once engulfed, the corpse and apoptotic bodies are degraded within the lysosomal system of the phagocyte and completely recycled. Lysosomes are one of the major sites of cellular degradation. </li>
<li>These morphological steps, separation of individual cells, cell shrinkage, condensation, fragmentation, phagocytosis and degradation are characteristic for apoptotic cells. And they are characteristic for apoptotic cells in pretty much all multicellular animals. As we will see later, one reason for this conservation of morphological changes is that the molecular mechanisms that underlie apoptotic cell death in multicellular animals are conserved at least from nematode worms to mammals. </li>
<li>The following movies show mammalian cells grown in culture as they undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Coming back to Kerr, Wyllie and Currie's 1972 paper and their observation of the morphological changes that cells that die by apoptosis undergo, once you can see these morphological changes happening, apoptosis has actually advanced quite a bit already. </li>
<li>All these stages here can be considered part of the final stage that results in the actual killing and dismantling of the cell, its engulfment and subsequent degradation. What happens before? There has to be a commitment step during which a particular cell is committed to the apoptotic fate. Before that there has to be a specification step during which it is decided, which cell dies in the first place. Therefore, our thinking is that there is an early specification stage during which it is decided which cells within a tissue, for example, should live and which cells should die. Once that decision has been taken, a cell needs to commit itself to the apoptotic fate in an irreversible manner. Once that commitment has been made, the cell is killed, dismantled, engulfed and degraded. </li>
<li>Before I tell you about the first clues about the molecular mechanisms involved in bringing about these morphological changes that are typical for apoptosis, I want to spend a couple of minutes summarizing the morphological changes that are typical for cells that undergo . </li>
<li>These here are again the characteristic morphological changes that a cell that dies by apoptosis is undergoing. Shrinkage, condensation, fragmentation into apoptotic bodies and eventually phagocytosis and degradation. </li>
<li>The same cell dying by necrosis would undergo the following characteristic morphological changes. Rather than shrinking, the cell would swell, organelles would rupture and eventually the plasma-membrane would rupture. Furthermore, because  necrosis is often a consequence of massive damage to tissues or organs, rather than individual cells being affected, many cells within a tissue or entire tissues are affected. </li>
<li>Finally, and maybe most importantly, while during apoptotic cell death, cellular content is never released into the cellular environment, in the case of necrosis, cytoplasm is spilled out because the plasma membrane ruptures. The release of cellular content elicits an immune response, which then leads to inflammation. In contrast, no immune response is elicited in the case of apoptosis, because cellular content is never spilled out. Apoptosis is therefore a very clean way of getting rid off unwanted cells whereas  is not a clean way of getting rid of unwanted cells. </li>
<li>As I mentioned earlier, the morphological changes described by Kerr, Wyllie and Currie were very helpful and suggested that there might be common molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptotic process in different multicellular animals. But, what are those molecular mechanisms? It took another 15 years or so, before the first protein with a role in apoptosis was identified. However, in the meantime, a couple of important molecular changes in apoptotic cells were discovered and these molecular changes allowed the cell death community to make some predictions about the types of enzymes that are involved in apoptosis. </li>
<li>In 1978, Zakharyan and Pogosyan published that the chromatin in apoptotic lymphocytes, cells of the immune system, is cleaved. Furthermore, they found that it is cleaved into inter-nucleosomal fragments of about 180 bp and multiples thereof. This cleavage is shown in the figure on the right, which is a picture of an agarose gel, in which DNA isolated from healthy cells was loaded in the right lane, a size marker was loaded in the center lane and DNA isolated from apoptotic cells was loaded in the left lane. The DNA was then separated by size in this agarose gel by applying an electrical field. </li>
<li>As you can see in the right lane, DNA isolated from healthy cells barely runs into the gel, which indicates that the DNA occurs in very long fragments, basically entire chromosomes, which are too large to be separated using such a gel. The left lane demonstrates that the DNA isolated from apoptotic cells is cleaved into small fragments that run into the gel and can be separated by size and that the cleaved DNA is of these characteristic sizes, 180 bp and multimeres thereof and this is often referred to as DNA ladder or nucleosomal ladder. </li>
<li>It turned out that the DNA gets cleaved during apoptosis not only in lymphocytes, which Zakharyan and Pogosyan used for this experiment, but in all cell types tested. Furthermore, DNA cleavage turns out to be an aspect of apoptosis that is conserved at least throughout the animal kingdom. The fact that DNA is cleaved in apoptotic cells is now used as an assay for apoptotic cells. DNA is isolated from the experimental cells and separated by size on an agarose gel just like the one shown on the slide to determine whether the DNA in the experimental cells occurs in fragments, as DNA ladder. If it does, it can be used as an indicator that the experimental cells died by apoptosis. </li>
<li>The TUNEL assay is also assaying for DNA fragmentation. However, the TUNEL assay can be done with individual cells in situ rather than a large population of cells as is necessary for the DNA ladder assay. Finally, the fact that DNA is cleaved into this specific DNA ladder implied that endonucleases, enzymes that can cleave DNA, must be activated during the apoptotic process to cause this DNA fragmentation. This was the first molecular clue. A second molecular clue came from studies on macrophages. Macrophages are phagocytes that recognize apoptotic cells and specifically bind to them. This results in the engulfment of the apoptotic cell and its subsequent degradation by the phagocyte. </li>
<li>How do phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells? Something must be different about the cell surface of apoptotic cells compared to the cell surface of healthy non-apoptotic cells. What is the nature of this “eat me signal”as it is often referred to? The cell surface is composed of the plasma-membrane, which encloses the cell and all the proteins that are associated with the plasma-membrane and that are exposed to the exterior of the cell. The plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer composed of different phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidyl serine, also referred to as simply PS. </li>
<li>The phospholipids in this bilayer, which is composed of an inner and outer leaflet, exhibit phospholipid asymmetry. What does this mean? It means that some of the phospholidpids are found predominantly in the outer leaflet of the plasma-membrane whereas other phospholipids are found predominantly in the inner leaflet. </li>
<li>Phosphatidyl choline, for example, is predominantly found in the outer leaflet and PS, which is negatively charged, is found exclusively in the inner leaflet. Work done by a number of investigator in the 1980s led to the discovery that macrophages preferentially bind to and engulf small lipid vesicles or droplets that contain negatively charged phospholipids such as PS. </li>
<li>These findings led to the hypothesis that macrophages may specifically recognize PS and that PS asymmetry may be lost in apoptotic cells. In a seminal paper published in 1992, Henson and coworkers at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center reported that PS asymmetry indeed is lost during apoptosis and that apoptotic cells exhibit PS on the outer leaflet. This event is often called PS externalization. With the discovery of PS externalization, the eat-me signal had been discovered. </li>
<li>The externalization of PS is now also used as an assay to detect apoptotic cells. One assay that takes advantage of this is Annexin V labeling. Annexin V is a protein that binds to negatively charged phospholipids such as PS. Annexin V-coupled to a fluorophore when added, for example, to cells grown in culture, will bind to cells that exhibit PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma-membrane and therefore on their cell surface. Due to the fluorophore that is coupled to Annexin V, these cells can then be visualized and quantitated using fluorescence microscopy. </li>
<li>The implication of this second molecular clue was that flippases must somehow be involved in the apoptotic process and cause PS externalization. Flippases are enzymes that are located in the plasma membrane and that can transfer phospholipids from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane for example. Like DNA fragmentation, PS externalization turned out to be a general phenomenon of apoptotic cells that is conserved throughout the animal kingdom.  </li>
