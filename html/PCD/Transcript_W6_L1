<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Week_6:_6.1_-_Summary_so_far....">Week 6:  6.1 - Summary so far....</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><p>At the beginning of this week, I would just like to take a few minutes to summarize what I have covered in the past five weeks and also use the opportunity to tell you about the things that I will cover in the coming week, the last week.  </p></li>
<li><p>I started out with a very general introduction to cell death, programmed cell death and specifically apoptosis. I told you about the morphological changes that cells that die by apoptosis undergo. I then focused on what I refer to as the Bcl-2 story, the discovery of the human <i>bcl-2</i> gene, the first protein identified with a role in apoptosis and this was through cancer genetics. Following that, I told you about the identification and functional characterization of additional members of what we now refer to as the Bcl-2 superfamily, the sensors, the guardians, and the effectors and how they might act in apoptosis.  </p></li>
<li><p>From cancer genetics and molecular biology, we then went to <i>C. elegans</i> and forward genetic screens that led to the identification of additional proteins with an important function in apoptosis, for example, the caspase <i>ced-3</i>.  </p></li>
<li><p>After this caspase story, I told you about the Apaf story, which led to the identification of initiator caspases, cytochrome c and Apaf-1, which is homologous to <i>C. elegans</i> CED-4. The identification of these additional components allowed the delineation of a central pathway for apoptosis in mammals and this pathway turned out to be conserved in worms. However, there appear to be some important differences at the mechanistic level between these pathways, one being the role of cytochrome c.  </p></li>
<li><p>I then delved into the regulation of the most upstream components of this central, conserved apoptosis pathway, the sensors or BH3-only proteins. And, I told you about the work that led to the identification of the mechanisms through which the activities of <i>C. elegans</i> <i>egl-1</i> and mammalian Bad and Bid are controlled.  The regulation of Bid also led me into the death receptor pathway, and this pathway mainly acts in the immune system.  </p></li>
<li><p>Taking a historical perspective, I have therefore given you information of the major components of this central apoptotic pathway. And I have done this by going through important experiments that led to seminal discovers and significant findings. I hope that with this, you have obtained a comprehensive understanding of the central apoptosis pathway as well as the methods and approaches that were used to derive the knowledge that we currently have of this important and fascinating process.  </p></li>
<li><p>What will we cover in this coming week? I will go over the areas of apoptosis that are currently still areas of active research.  I will tell you about non-apoptotic functions of components of the central pathway. Another topic I would like to cover is the role of these components in human disease and how we can use our knowledge of the central apoptosis pathway to develop novel therapeutics. And finally, if we still have time I will briefly cover the areas that my group is currently working on.  </p></li>
