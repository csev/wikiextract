After the First World War, a group of mathematicians, scientists and philosophers
formed the *Wiener Kreis*, in English called the *Vienna circle*. They were unhappy
with the metaphysics of the German idealists, who focused on first principles of knowledge and the fundamental nature of being.

The Vienna circle, with members like Moritz *Schlick*, Otto *Neurath* and Rudolf *Carnap*, felt idealist questions about the self and existence were meaningless because they were unanswerable.
They proposed a new philosophy of science called **logical positivism**.

The logical positivists redefined science as the study of **meaningful statements**
about the world.
For a statement to be meaningful it has to be verifiable, which is known as
the **verification criterion**.
It means that it should be possible to determine the truth of a statement.

There are two types of meaningful statements. Analytical statements and syntactical
statements. **Analytical statements** are tautological, necessarily true.
Examples are “bachelors are unmarried” and “all squares have four sides”.
They are ***a priori statements***, like definitions and purely logical statements.

They don't depend on the state of the world and therefore don't require observation
to be verified. They can be used in mathematics and logic. New combinations of
analytical statements can be verified with formal logic.

**Syntactical statements** depend on the state of the world. Examples of syntactical
statements are: “All bachelors are happy” and: “All cats are born with tails”. These
statements are ***a posteriori***; they can only be verified through observation. The
logical positivists thought these statements should be always **publicly accessible**.

Also, statements are not allowed to refer to **unobservable entities** like “electron” or “gravity”, because they can't be observed directly. 

If a statement makes reference to an unobservable entity, is not tautological or not logically or empirically verifiable, then that statement is meaningless.
Subjects like metaphysics, theology and ethics were thereby nicely excluded from science. 

Of course the
criterion
of verification through
observation
couldn’t deal with
the
problem of
*induction*. No amount of confirmatory evidence is ever enough to
definitively prove
or
verify
a statement. It’s always possible a contradictory observation
will be found in the future. So the
strong criterion
of verification
was weakened
by requiring
only **confirmation**
instead of verification.

Another very strict rule
also
had to be changed. Not allowing
reference to
unobservable
entities
created
big
problems.
Entities
like “electron”, ”gravity” and
“depression”
cannot be observed directly,
but
they are
indispensable
in
scientific
explanations. This, together with the problem of induction,
led to a more moderate
version of logical positivism
called **logical empiricism**. 

**Karl
Popper**,
who was
nicknamed "the official opposition" by the Vienna circle,
was
one of their main critics. He argued that
the distinction between
meaningful and
meaningless statements should be based on
the criterion of
***falsification***, not
verification.

Karl Popper argued that we can never conclusively verify
or prove
a statement
with
observations,
but we can
conclusively disprove
it with contradictory evidence.
According to Popper a
statement
is
meaningful
only
if
it’s
**falsifiable**. 

Popper
proposes that
scientists should actively engage in "risky experiments".
These are
experiments
that maximize the chance
of finding
evidence
that contradicts
our
hypothesis.
If we find such contradictory evidence, we inspect it for clues how to
improve our hypothesis. The hypothesis is provisionally supported, only if
contradictory
evidence is absent. 

Now,
**Willard van Orman Quine**
showed that this criterion
is
also
problematic.
In
the
Duhem-Quine thesis,
he
states
that no hypothesis can be tested in
isolation;
there are
always background assumptions
and
supporting
hypotheses.

Now i
f
contradictory
evidence
is found
then according to Popper, our scientific
expla
nation is wrong and should
be
rejected
it (sic).
But according to Quine we can always
reject one of the
background assumptions or
supporting
hypotheses
instead. This way
we
can salvage the original hypothesis.

**Thomas Kuhn**
pointed
out that science doesn't develop
out of strict application of either
the verification or
the
falsification principle. Hypotheses
aren't immediately rejected or
revised if the data don't agree with them.

Science takes place within a certain framework or
paradigm. Hypotheses are generated
that fit within this paradigm. Unexpected results
lead to revision of hypotheses
but only
as long as they fit the framework. If this is impossible,
the results are just ignored.
But when
more contradictory evidence accumulates, a crisis occurs,
which leads to a
paradigm shift.
A new paradigm is adopted and the cycle begins again.

Even in it's weaker form
of logical empiricism, logical positivism couldn’t
stand up to
the critique of Popper, Quine and others.
Since then, we’ve progressed to a more
pragmatic philosophy of science. 

Today
scientists follow the
**hypothetico-deductive
method**, combining induction and
deduction, requiring falsifiability and accepting repeated
confirmation only as
provisional support for a hypothesis. 

Philosophically,
many scientists
would probably be comfortable with
**Bas van Fraassen**'s
***constructive
empiricism***, which
states that science aims to produce
empirically adequate theories. 

Knowledge requires
observation, but unobservable entities
are
allowed. Accepting a
scientific theory doesn’t mean accepting it as
definitive,
a
true
representation of the
world.
According to a constructive empiricist, a
scientific statement is
accepted as
true
*as far as our
observations go*;
whether
the statement
truthfully represents the
unobservable
entities
simply
cannot be determined.
We just have a
current best
explanation for our observations.
That’s it.
