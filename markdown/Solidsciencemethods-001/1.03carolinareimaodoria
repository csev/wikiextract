**Observation**
-------------------- 
  >+ Most basic claim, can be an accurate or inaccurate representation of the world 
   + Don't have explanatory power on their own, but are the building blocks
   + They are useful to confirm or contradict


**Hypothesis**
-------------------- 
  >+ Describes pattern or general relation between properties
   + Can be strongly supported if supported by various observations
  
**Laws**
-------------------- 
  >+ Special type of hypothesis 
   + Well substantiated by many empirical studies 
   + Very accurate predictions (but don't always provide explanations for the relationships they describe) 
    + *e.g.* mathematical explanations, rarely formulated in social sciences because of limited understanding of human behaviour

**Theory**
-------------------- 
  >+ The best established explanations
    + Hypotheses that have survived refutation, closest thing to certainty
   + *"In science there is no certainty only a provisional best explanation"* <sup>([1][1])</sup>
