# Glossary
Please help your fellow students by giving definitions of words and concepts that you encounter during your interaction with the video lectures, readings or forum discussions.

- **Communicable disease**:

- **Demographic transition**: the transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition)).

- **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**: One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The sum of these DALYs across the population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability ([source](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/index.html)). 

- **Double burden of disease**: A defined area (region, territory or country) having to deal with both centuries old communicable diseases, like infectious diarrhea, as well as modern noncommunicable diseases, like heart disease or tobacco related diseases. ([source](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_definition_of_double_burden_of_disease)).

- **Epidemiological transition**: 

- **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)**: The WHO global burden of disease (GBD) measures burden of disease using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY). This time-based measure combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of life lost due to time lived in states of less than full health. The DALY metric was developed in the original GBD 1990 study to assess the burden of disease consistently across diseases, risk factors and regions. ([source](http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/)).

- **Global Health**: The health of populations in a global context and transcends the perspectives and concerns of individual nations. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health))

- **Incubation time**:

- **Infection**:

- **Infectious disease**:

- **International Health**: A field of health care and research, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Health))

- **Microbes**:

- **Multilateral organizations**: Organizations formed between three or more nations to work on issues that relate to all of the countries in the organization. ([source](http://geni.org/globalenergy/library/organizations/))

- **Onchocerciasis**:

- **Pathogenes**:

- **Prevention and treatment**:

- **Primary Health Care**: The ultimate goal of primary health care is better health for all. WHO has identified five key elements to achieving that goal: (a) reducing exclusion and social disparities in health (universal coverage reforms); (b) organizing health services around people's needs and expectations (service delivery reforms); (c) integrating health into all sectors (public policy reforms); (d) pursuing collaborative models of policy dialogue (leadership reforms); and (e) increasing stakeholder participation. ([source](http://http://www.who.int/topics/primary_health_care/en/)).

- **Vaccination**:

- **Vectors of disease**:


# Abbreviations

- **DALY**: Disability-Adjusted Life Years

- **GBD**: Global Burden of Disease

- **MDG**: Millennium Development Goals

- **YLL**: Years of life lost due to early death

- **NCDs**: Non-communicable diseases

- **TB**: Tuberculosis

# Lecture notes
- (1) Diabetes was associated with increased risk of TB regardless of study design and population.
- (2) Poverty has relation with Epidemics.
- (3) The silencing of insulin genes may be the factor of Type two Diabetes.
- (4) Fatal genes programming can be revised from generation to generation.
- (5) Western lifestyle and exposed to in early life are both the fuel for NCDs.
- (6) Diabetes was associated with an increased risk for tuberculosis, no matter which study design or no matter which population.
- (7) Compared 1999 with2011, in YLL aspect, NCDs has remarkably growth!
- (8) Diet and smoking are both the important factors for urban resident to have NCDs!
