This is a quick copy from forum discussion to start creating a list of cross references from course units to textbook sections:

https://class.coursera.org/introbiology-001/forum/thread?thread_id=49

My guess for Unit 1 is:

OpenStax Biology [OS]: all and only whole of Chapter 2, "The Chemical Foundation of Life", pp41-70

Campbell and Reece, Biology 8edn [CR8] all and only whole of Chapter 2, "The Chemical Context of Life", pp30-45

Scott Freeman Biological Science, 3edn, [SF3] all and only whole of Chapter 2. "Water and Carbon: The Chemical Basis of Life", pp18-42.

Note: I have not yet read ANY of the above, nor finished watching videos for unit 1 or doing quizes etc. Just guessing from table of contents.

Above is purely to suggest format for [abbreviated reference] and in hope that others with more knowledge can recommend more limited subsections of these chapters (and/or sections from additional chapters) for this and subsequent units.

Could somebody more familiar with wiki editing please make this a sub-page with suitable sub-heads (per unit/sub-unit and per textbook and perhaps for Basic and Scholar tracks) from a main page that also has headings for other course related notes.

Meanwhile, simply edit this to add or vary recommendations.
