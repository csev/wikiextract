#Interactive
* [Ecological Footprint Calculator](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/calculators/) How much land area does it take to support your lifestyle? N.b. On 25 November 2013 New Scientist ran a piece by Fred Pearce entitled ["Admit it: we can't measure our ecological footprint"](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029445.000-admit-it-we-cant-measure-our-ecological-footprint.html#.UpR04GRDuFc). Pearce says "The Ecological Footprint has gained widespread currency, cited by governments, news media and in reports from United Nations agencies. But a recent analysis suggests that it is nonsense." "It's a nice publicity stunt," he goes on, but "unfortunately it's piffle." The New Scientist article is based on a scientific assessment by Blomqvist et al. in PLOS Biology, entitled ["Does the Shoe Fit? Real versus Imagined Ecological Footprints"](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001700). In that paper they say, "Given the broad influence and popular appeal of the EF, its measurement and underpinning assumptions warrant close scrutiny... this [paper] intends to demonstrate, however, that EF measurements, as currently constructed and presented, are so misleading as to preclude their use in any serious science or policy context." This Corsera course had quite a bit of [information on the Ecological Footprint.](https://class.coursera.org/climateliteracy-002/forum/thread?thread_id=848#post-4937)

#Books

* [Six Degrees](http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Future-Hotter-Planet/dp/1426203853/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1385810531&sr=8-1&keywords=mark+lynas+six+degrees) From Amazon.com: Possibly the most graphic treatment of global warming that has yet been published, Six Degrees is what readers of Al Gore's best-selling An Inconvenient Truth or Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point will turn to next. Written by the acclaimed author of High Tide, this highly relevant and compelling book uses accessible journalistic prose to distill what environmental scientists portend about the consequences of human pollution for the next hundred years.

* [The Geography of Hope](http://www.randomhouse.ca/authors/58704/chris-turner) Point of no return: The chilling phrase has become the ubiquitous mantra of ecological doomsayers, a troubling headline above stories of melting permafrost and receding ice caps, visions of catastrophe and fears of a problem with no solution. Daring to step beyond the rhetoric of panic and despair, The Geography of Hope points to the bright light at the end of this very dark tunnel.
