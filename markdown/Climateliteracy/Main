[[Category:Climate Literacy]]
**Welcome to the wiki for Climate Literacy: Navigating Climate Change Conversations!**

This is a space you can use to collect and share resources that you think will be useful after the course is over.  

**Feel free to contribute! (Use the "Edit" tab in the upper right.)** Wikis are works in progress, so don't be too worried about making "mistakes" with it. If you've never edited a wiki and have trouble with formatting, you may ask for help in the course forums or simply wait for a kind stranger to resolve the issue. For specific help with editing, see the [Help page](https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/Help:Editing) or the [syntax documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

It would be good to also find time to understand the very important public relations battle between climate change scientists and those who deny climate change. The former group is often timid, and the latter frequently very convincing and aggressive.

#Open Access Resources

###[[Climateliteracy:OpenAccess | Open Access Literature on Climate Science or Policy]]  
Increasingly, some academic literature is being published in the "open access" model, meaning available to all without a subscription.  Some journals are completely open access; others have just a few free articles, or make their older material available for free after some time period.  If you know of good open-access scholarly articles about the topics in this course, please click this link and add those resources.  Please be sure to include enough information about your addition that others can quickly see what it's about, and also include a link to the article or journal.

http://www.scirp.org/Journal/CategoryOfJournal.aspx?categoryID=5 is the page of Earth & Environmental Science section of the Scientific Research Open Access.

PLOS One has two sections dedicated to Earth Sciences http://www.plosone.org/browse/earth_sciences and Ecology and Environmental Sciences http://www.plosone.org/browse/ecology_and_environmental_sciences

World Resources Institute http://d7.wri.atendesigngroup.com/ provides access to data, policy development and tools for change for climate change and other environmental issues.


###[[Climateliteracy:DataPortals | Open Access Climate Data]]  
Interested in analyzing climate data yourself?  Here's a place to collect links to climate science data, much of which you'll see in the course.  Feel free to add links to data sources here.

###[[Climateliteracy:OtherMedia | Beyond the Literature]]  
A repository of interesting articles, videos and other media beyond the peer-reviewed literature.

###Modelling Software
* [Online Models from the University of Chicago](http://forecast.uchicago.edu/models.html) A companion resource to David Archer's book, "Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast".

#Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) -- Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
Many of us are waiting with great anticipation for the release of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) -- the first comprehensive update to our understanding of climate change since [AR4](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/contents.html) was finalized in 2007.

[Climate Change 2013](http://www.climatechange2013.org/): The new homepage of Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis.

The [Summary for Policymakers](http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/WGIAR5-SPM_Approved27Sep2013.pdf) of "Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis" was finalized and released on 27 Sept 2013. The full text of the report will be available on 30 Sept 2013. The other two working group reports (WGII: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and WGIII: Mitigation of Climate Change) will not be released until next year. Therefore, AR4 remains the most relevant to the full range of topics covered in this course.

###[[Climateliteracy:IPCC-AR5 | Reactions and Analyses]]
Post links to articles related to the recent publication of the first part of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) here.

#Climate Change in the Media
Post links to articles related to the challenges inherent in media coverage of such a contentious issue.

* [STUDY: Media Sowed Doubt In Coverage Of UN Climate Report](http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/10/10/study-media-sowed-doubt-in-coverage-of-un-clima/196387) - Media Matters weighs in on reporting about IPCC's AR5 in the U.S.

* [A Carbon Tax America Could Live With](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/business/a-carbon-tax-that-america-could-live-with.html?_r=0) - Economics Prof Mankiw in New York Times


#Climate in Your Own Backyard
Post links to activities, projects, policies and events in your region!

#Course Schedule: Timezones
The [Course Schedule](https://class.coursera.org/climateliteracy-002/wiki/view?page=schedule), including access dates and deadlines, uses the "UTC -7" timezone. This is currently Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) in Vancouver, where UBC is located. Vancouver's UTC offset will change when we come off daylight savings on the morning of November 3rd, and the subsequent deadlines use "UTC -8".

The instructors will issue a notice at that time, reminding people that the end of daylight savings may affect the local time of the deadlines for anyone in regions that do not observe daylight savings.

###Managing Your Timezone
Under your name in the upper right corner of your screen (when logged on) is a drop-down menu. If you select 'Settings' then select your own Timezone then click 'Change Timezone' all course time notices etc will be shown in your local time.

You may also find some useful timezone tools at [www.timeanddate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com), or you may export the course calendar into the program of your choice.
