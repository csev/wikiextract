# 3.1 DCSI: Dino Crime Scene Investigators
I'm Bruce Fouke from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. If we think about the idea of crimes and our ability to reconstruct a crime scene, we immediately think of crimes that might have happened days or hours or weeks ago, and we think immediately of crime scene investigation units that are housed in police departments all over planet Earth, and this ability to use a combination of observation and very clever intuition and also apply the most cutting-edge tools that we have available, both in terms of the physical analysis of objects, the photography of objects, or the DNA and RNA extraction from blood and bones and other body parts that are found at crime scenes. This is something that almost everyone now is quite familiar with because of the popularity of TV shows, but one way to look at evolutionary biologists who study evolutionary history and the history of life itself through geological time, it's required that those scientists are truly forensic scientists who do a very similar type of work as CSI, except the time frames are different. We're talking about going back and finding the beheaded carcass of a hadrosaur that went crossways with a tyrannosaurus rex during the Cretaceous time period at 110 million years before present, but fundamentally, the approach is the same. 

So I think it's really important to evaluate what are the lines of evidence, because eventually we have to stand in a court of law. Now, of course it doesn't have to do with modern-day crimes, but the court of law for an evolutionary scientist is the ability to publish, and then from those publications then be able to write grants and gain new research funding to do the next line of investigation. So there is a court of justice when it comes to doing science, and it's very, very intense and it's very competitive to do this. 

So what are those lines of evidence for doing dinosaur crime scene investigation? Well one of them is that dinosaurs, part of the diapsid reptile lineage, they had very thick and leathery skin. So the skin itself is very preservable, or can become fossilized relatively easily, and that's really the question for us, is what are the pieces and parts of the history of the body or the life of a dinosaur that could actually get fossilized? So preservation potential is what we want to think about. So in this picture you see is a good example of a large piece of dinosaur skin that was beautifully preserved from the Cretaceous time period, and this one was found in some of the classic fossil sites that are up in Canada in Alberta. And in this piece of dinosaur skin that was fossilized, we have beautiful preservation of the individual cells. 

There are many plants that undergo these kind of preservations, things like the petrified forest where you have groundwater move in in an ion-by-ion basis, dissolve out and remove the original plant cells, and then precipitate a mineral like silicon dioxide in its place, so we call that replacement fossilization. Well, the same thing happens with dinosaurs, but even more remarkably we have examples of the replacement of dinosaur skin into another type of mineral, but even other deposits we've been finding that the dinosaur skin itself is still partially mummified and preserved. So we have a lot of information about dinosaur skin from these slabs and pieces of dinosaur skin that have been found in the geological record. 

One thing that we don't have such good control on yet is what everyone wants to see when they see these kind of beautiful reconstructions and 3D pictures of dinosaurs, is what was their color. Now, color reconstruction is something that many of the pigments that were in the original skin of the dinosaur, if you do have this remarkable skin preservation, those pigments fade and-and disappear with time. So most artists who work with scientists, the color red, if blood is fluxed through vesicles and veins that are near the surface of a dinosaur, then that skin would have turned red from the blood, but the other pigments, which we know that there would have been many, blue and green and orange and all kinds of beautiful pigmentation, we don't have a lot of good control on that. So oftentimes, the morphologies and the skeletal structure and the reconstructions we see that-are so striking for us, especially in Hollywood for the movies, most of those are fanciful and they're linked to reality, but we don't necessarily always have good evidence for the coloration. 

Now, another piece of evidence is one that might be a little uncomfortable to think about, but it's basically, it's dinosaur doo-doo; it's dinosaur defecation. You know, the dinosaurs were large and there were a lot of them, and you know, there's just a fact of life; there was a lot of dinosaur poop that was created throughout the entire process of having dinosaurs both in the marine environment and in the terrestrial environment. So fossilized dinosaur poop, fossilized dinosaur defecation, is a really important piece of information about the dinosaurs, and not only is it the composition of the fossilized defecation important to us, but also the distribution of it, and then linking it to what it was eating and what it was doing, and going forward, again, we do this in the modern. Looking at stool samples is an important way for doctors to be able to understand human health, so these aren't foreign things to us. We have a unique name for these fossilized dinosaur defecation deposits, and they're called coprolites. And the coprolites are very abundant throughout the world wherever you get these dinosaur remains. 

Another important part of-of dinosaur forensics, if you will, is the dinosaur egg. So dinosaurs, some of them had a leathery outer membrane, but others actually had true eggs that were very similar to some of the hard-shelled eggs that modern-day chickens have. So dinosaur eggs are very well-preserved in some places. Now, of course a chicken egg, making the analogy to that, it's a pretty sturdy object, right? I mean, you can crush it, but it's actually quite strong, and if you were to have a grouping of chicken eggs put into some kind of a depression or pocket that was protected from too much force that would crush them, you can actually get full eggs nicely preserved in your shopping bag, right, because you make it from the grocery store home and the eggs are still in one good piece. So fundamentally, the dinosaurs did this for us by laying many of their eggs in nests. 

So as an example, the hadrosaurs in the Cretaceous would build nests where there'd be an elevated platform of mud perhaps as high as half a meter to a meter. It had a depression in the middle; it looked kind of like a little volcano, and in the middle of that depression they would lay their eggs. And sometimes they would partially cover those eggs, and if the eggs in a mud nest were to be inundated, say, by a flooding event from a stream or perhaps the dinosaurs would place sediment into the nest, some kind of an event that would take place to add a covering of sediment over the top, you have a ready-made egg container that's going to preserve those eggs through geological time and prevent them from being destroyed. So as we can see in this image, the eggs not only are preserved in the outer shell, but remarkably inside we have the embryonic stages that are well fossilized, and we can see there the internal vertebrate skeleton of the dinosaurs as well. 

Well, recently too, analyses of the inner portions of the dinosaur eggs have shown that, remarkably, there are bacterial cells that are preserved inside of the eggs as well, and we see those in modern-day chicken eggs, in addition. So the idea that dinosaur eggs are very well-fossilized, and some of the most famous sites of these come from Mongolia, but they are in other places as well. It's another piece of forensic evidence that we put together to have such a robust history. 

Now, in the modern day, if there's a crime, one of the first things that they do on TV, of course, is they look outside the window in the dirt and look for the track of the culprit who'd done the murder, climbed out the window, and they have this beautiful print of their boot, which of course they make a plaster cast of, and then they go off trying to find where that boot was manufactured and who sold it to the bad guy. Well we do the same thing with the dinosaurs. There are many examples of what we call dinosaur tracks and dinosaur traces, and so one of the most well-developed ones of these actually comes from Connecticut, as we see in this picture, and, there was a sauropod, one of the long-necked saurischian, herbivorous dinosaurs that was walking as part of a herd across a shallow part of the margin of the ocean where you had muds and sands, and their body weight would have create a very deep depression of their footprint, and they kept marching forward. As we can see in this image those dinosaur footprints are extremely well-preserved. And from the footprints, by measuring the diameter and the size of the footprints, how deep the footprint went into the sediments, and then the distance between footprints, we can reconstruct body size, age, and the speed at which the dinosaurs were walking or running, and in fact there are many examples, as we see in this image, where we have the predator-prey relationship fossilized in the footprints. And so you can see the large footprints, in this case, of a saurischian T-Rex dinosaur that was chasing some kind of smaller, probably herbivorous dinosaur. You can see there the example of the large footprints and the small footprints. 

Now, of course I've saved toward the end one of the most remarkable lines of evidence, and that's the fossilized dinosaur bones. And so, hopefully everyone, if you haven't seen them in person, at least you've seen them through these kind of images, these remarkable entire full skeletons that have been recovered from the fossil record, and these continue to be found. You know, many students make the assumption that all dinosaurs have been found, and therefore the field is now working on dinosaur bones that are collected and hiding in drawers in some kind of museum; that couldn't be farther from the truth. On a daily basis, new dinosaur finds are occurring all the time, and the remarkable preservation of these bones, it's not just the mineral replacement that is found, but actually the full bone itself, and there are scientists, that have found actual pieces of connective tissue, which are still exhibiting the pigment of the red blood cells within those connective tissues. Remarkable, right? And these things are on the order of 90 to 100 million years old. So crime scene investigation of the demise of the dinosaurs, and the life history and the habits of the dinosaurs, it's a very exciting, very robust, very integrative and cutting-edge type of field, and as science and technology moves forward, and our ability to have advancements in human medicine go forward, those same tools that are derived from those areas of scientific advancement can be used directly to the fossil record.

# 3.2 Ancient Forensic Science: Fossilization
My name is Carly Miller, and I'm at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, and I'd like to start out with discussing fossils today and the process of fossilization and why that's important. And one of the main things that we want to consider when we're thinking about evolution and how organisms have changed over geologic time is what is our evidence for that and what is our evidence for the qualitative observations of how those organisms have changed over time. And one of the major pieces of evidence is physical fossils that you actually find in your backyard or in the field, and we want to start to get pretty specific about what are the types of fossils, what are the modes of preservation, which means how are those organisms actually preserved in the rock record, how that happens, what are the biases in the rock record, meaning are all the organisms actually represented equally throughout geologic time or in a specific sediment or something. 

And so to start out, the definition of a fossil is evidence of past life. So that could mean a skeleton, a footprint, coal, some sort of chemical trace, something like that, and all of those are evidence of life, and they are preserved generally in sedimentary rocks. And if you can find a fossil and start to think about it critically, we can actually deduce a lot of information about those organisms: how they lived, how they are represented over time, how they grew, how they died, all sorts of great information from a simple fossil specimen.

So what I'd like to start with is just identifying the three types of fossils. So the first one is called a body fossil. A body fossil is just something that you can find that actually has the original material of that organism. So for example, we have a skeleton. So if you find a piece of a skeleton, a tiny little metacarpal or the bridge of a nose or something like that, or a tooth, those are all examples of body fossils, and so that's the first type of fossil that you could identify. 

Secondly, there's a chemical fossil, which again, you don't find any actual original piece of the organism, but you find a chemical trace, and on Earth, that's carbon. So in this case, for example, coal is a great piece of evidence that there was a lot of biomass, there was a lot of organic material present at that time that that coal was made, basically. So that's an example of a chemical fossil is coal. And so we're just looking for some sort of a chemical signature, which again, a carbon signature that you find that is unusual and indicates the presence of a living organism. 

Lastly we have a trace fossil; and I mentioned earlier that a footprint is a fossil. So you don't have an actual toe, you don't have the foot, but you have evidence that life was there, and you have a footprint. And so maybe a really exciting type of footprint is Sasquatch. No, should I say that? You know, evidence of bigfoot, you know, if we find an actual footprint of that, that would possibly be some good evidence! But more seriously, evidence of a dinosaur. If we can find a dinosaur track, that is evidence that a dinosaur lived, and so you can start piecing together what size was that animal, how did it run; did it run? But we can start to figure out even its speed, and how it ate. So even just from footprints, and again, that's called a trace fossil. So if you find a little slimy track in some sort of a basin or something and you see just a scrape or something that looks unusual to you, you might say, "Something might have been dragging its body around here or dragging its tail," and that is a fossil, if it's been pre-preserved. So that, again, is evidence of life. 

So those are the three types of fossils, and as you go through the course and you're looking, we present you with different specimens to look at, you're going to want to start to identify these things as, "What category does this actually fall in? A body, a trace, or a chemical fossil?" So here we have an example of a trace fossil. And so what you can start to observe about this particular specimen is that there's no real changes in color, there's no real obvious representation yet of an actual part of the body, and so what you might start to deduce is that this could be a track; this is a type of track or a trace, so this is a good example of a trace fossil. 

So thinking about that, thinking about how an organism is buried, what you might start to process in your mind is, "Well, what types of organisms are fossilized better than others? And what types of material are fossilized better than others?" And so what we call this biases in the fossil record. And so what we want to consider here is, for example, you can think about comparing how a worm is fossilized versus maybe how a shell is fossilized or how some big bulky structure is fossilized, or perhaps how a delicate little skeleton, you know, if a hummingbird's little skeleton is going to be fossilized well compared to a more simple organism. And so all these differences in organism structure and chemical composition and lifestyle, all those things affect how it is represented over geologic time in the fossil record. So, for example, one of the things you would consider is how the structure of the organism affects that. So does it have hard parts or does it have soft parts? So which do you think would be fossilized better? I would say hard parts, right? So soft parts can decompose quickly. If they're exposed to oxygen, that's going to decompose fairly quickly and be carried away by groundwater. But perhaps the bones or the shell or the exoskeleton, perhaps that is left behind more readily, and it is. So we have a better representation of those hard parts, and most of the time you have to infer those soft parts, unless you're really lucky. 

So another factor that affects a bias in the fossil record is the chemical composition of that organism. So for example, some organic materials are very resistant to decay. When we compare perhaps an inorganic material such as calcium carbonate, which is the composition of a skeleton, the calcium carbonate there is fairly easily dissolved versus maybe a more organic composition of a skeleton such as our bones. So that is something to consider, is what was that original chemical composition of that organism and how is that either more easily dissolved, or does it resist decay and dissolution. So that's something that's going to be affecting how that organism is represented in the rock record. 

Okay, another one to consider when thinking about the modes of preservation, is how robust is that organism is. So does it have big bones? If you think of an elephant, for a very obvious example, it probably has a very robust skeleton. It has to carry a lot of weight, it's very dense, you know, it has to move those big muscles, and so you have a lot of calcification going on there; you have a robust skeleton. And if you think of maybe a bat, to compare two mammals. If you think of a bat, that is a very delicate structure. Think of that wing. I mean, we have a very delicate structure there, tiny bones, probably very porous, and so if just for those two examples of mammal, how are those different types of skeletons going to be differently represented in the rock record? And so the answer to that is the more robust skeleton is generally preserved better, which makes logical sense. 

So the last thing to consider when thinking about how an organism is represented in the rock record is the number of parts that it's made of. So again, this should make logical sense to you. This should be common sense, is that if you have a large number of pieces in your body, one might be scattered. Your arm might fly off and be preserved elsewhere, and so that would be harder to reconstruct your entire body if those many parts were scattered, so versus maybe a shell or a bivalve that has two pieces. Those two pieces, you have a better chance of finding those two pieces than, you know, 108 bones. No, is it 208 bones in your body. So what we want to think about here is the number of bones or number of parts that compose an organism. And so what you want to think about is that a larger number of pieces of an organism are harder to represent accurately in the rock record than an organism with maybe one or two or fewer pieces. So that's another introduction of bias into the fossil record. 

Another important usage of fossils and fossil assemblages, which is a collection of different fossils, often a different number of organisms, is the power of correlation. So you can look at fossils from a certain part of the world or a certain stratum, so a layer of rock or sedimentary rock, and you can travel to another area, if it's in your backyard or if it's across the ocean in Africa or wherever, and you can look at those fossil assemblages and you can start to think about either the difference or the similarity in the organisms that you're finding in those regions. Where they actually juxtaposed right next to each other at one point, which perhaps with Pangaea, we actually did have South America and Africa right next to each other, and so that could be a really logical geographical correlation you can make, is "Wow, these structures were actually right next to each other way back in geological time." And secondarily, you can start to think about how they relate to each other in time, and so if you see certain fossils living in maybe North America during a certain time over geological time, and then you find them start to emerge, maybe, across an ocean again, you'll be able to inform the progression and evolution of that organism and how it was able to survive in different regions.

So what we need to consider next is kind of the relevance of fossils. So if you find a specimen in your backyard, it's not just a pretty specimen, it actually has some very important uses when we're thinking about evolution and how the structure of the earth has changed over time and how the representation of those organisms is both represented in the rock record and how we can interpret that. And so the primary usage for fossils is actually dating. So the geological time scale was actually sort of broken up or constructed by lining up the number of fossils, the number of organisms that we find in a certain age or a certain assemblage, and how maybe that organism started to decline and maybe go extinct, and then we have an emergence of another fossil that you see in another layer of sedimentary rock, and if that maybe becomes a more robust representation in the rock record, and then how maybe that declined over time. And so a lot of the major time points in the geological time scale are marked by these either mass extinction events, which were discovered by the representation of those organisms in the rock record. And so that's something that is really important with the usage of fossils, and when you consider a fossil you want to think about how it lived, and we can track how organisms on Earth lived and changed and died and reemerged over geologic time.

# 3.3 Getting Old and Well-Preserved: Modes of Preservation 
I'm Carly Miller at the University of Illinois, and I'd like to discuss the modes of preservation, which is the process that acts upon an organism from death to present day, or when a scientist stumbles upon the fossil. So there are very specific terms that we'd like to introduce and be familiar with when we're looking at a hand specimen so that we can identify exactly what happened to that organism after death and how did it come to the state that it is in at the present. 

So the first mode of preservation is called original preservation, and what that means is that actual original material from that organism is still intact in that fossils specimen. So for example, we have an agnathan here, which is a jawless fish, which you'll learn, and you can tell that it's been well-preserved. You actually still have scales that seem to be the same chemical composition that it was when it was living, and so we would call this original preservation. It actually still has scales; a few little hard parts are still intact. So original preservation, you can have soft parts, if you're lucky. If it's frozen, if it's buried quickly, you might have a shoulder or a piece of meat, or one of those soft parts of the organism still preserved, but more than likely you're going to have the skeleton or a hard part that survived over geologic time. 

The second type of preservation is called carbonization, and that is basically when an organism has died, has been buried quickly and usually pressurized, and basically reduced to a carbon signature, which in general you can identify it by a black smudge. That's what we're reduced to when carbon is pressurized. It's basically just a carbon signature, and it's a black smudge. So you'll see that often with fern plants; that's a very readily-preserved carbonized, organism, is the fern plant. And so what you'll see is an imprint of that organism and a black smudge, and you can start to think, "Okay, I don't see any actual body parts of that organism, but I know that it was made of carbon and I see an imprint there." And that's the mode called carbonization. 

The third one is called recrystallization. And the tricky part about recrystallization is that you actually have to have a little bit of knowledge about what the original composition of that organism was. And so, for example, we have a coral, and so you might say, as a savvy scientist, "Well I know that corals are made of calcium carbonate, and that can form into two different minerals, aragonite and calcite, for example." And so if you know that, you can look at a specimen and you can say, "Well, I know what aragonite looks like," right? You do. "I know what aragonite looks like, and this just doesn't quite look right. It seems to have the same chemical composition, but the mineral has shifted, or the needle shape is different." And so you can start to kind of put those things together in your mind, and what's really neat about recrystallization is it can have very specific structure. If you look at a specimen you can see really specific septa, which is what they're called, but they look like kind of ribs radiating out from the mouth of a coral. And you can get really great resolution in that fossil specimen, but it's been altered over time. So what recrystallization is so in this case, you start with calcium carbonate, the organism dies, is buried, it's infiltrated with water, and that water dissolves that mineral or that chemical composition there, but it starts to recrystallize basically right after it's been dissolved, and so it starts recrystallizing right in place where those original little nucleation points were, where those needles were, and so you get the same chemical composition, but it's been altered slightly, so it is a different form. So we call that recrystallization. 

So the fourth type of preservation is called replacement, and this is very similar to recrystallization, so we want to make sure that we can differentiate between the two. And again, you have to have some knowledge of that original chemical composition or texture or the characteristics of that living specimen. And so what replacement is is when groundwater infiltrates a buried, dead organism and it dissolves and carries away those chemical components of either the shell or the skeleton or something like that, and it carries it away, and a completely new chemical composition infiltrates the system, carried by groundwater, and it recrystallizes or fills in that void space that that organism had died in or was buried in, and so it is replaced completely with a different chemical composition. So again, you have to have to have some knowledge of that original organism and what it looked like and what it felt like and what it was made of when it was living to identify that as replacement versus recrystallization versus original preservation. So we want to be careful with that, with replacement versus recrystallization. 

So another great example of a replacement fossil is this brachiopod here. And why it's so great is that most people know that shells in general have a certain texture and a certain color that you're familiar with, usually kind of a white color, maybe made of aragonite or something like that, and you would be familiar with that color, just with your own observations. And why this is such a great sample, and it's such a great example of a replacement fossil is if you look at the surface really closely, you can tell that it's covered in a shiny material, a shiny mineral, and what that actually is is pyrite, which is fool's gold, you might know it as fool's gold. And so you'd know, probably from your own experience or maybe your research or something that shells are not made of fool's gold, and so you can start to think, "Well what happened to this organism after it died and how did it get to this state where it's covered in fool's gold?" You'll start to realize that the shell wasn't originally made of that. And so you can make that connection where the organism died, meteoric water went through the system, carried away the original, maybe perhaps aragonite material, carried it away, and then brought in the components of fool's gold, and precipitated on that sort of matrix. And so there we have a great example of a replacement fossil. 

The next mode of preservation is called permineralization. And so usually you start with a porous part of the organism, so for example bone is very porous on the inside. Wood is very porous on the inside. And so what happens is after burial, groundwater, again, infiltrates the system and carries in a mineral and fills in those pore spaces with a mineral, and so what happens is that that fossil actually ends up quite heavy. Sometimes you can see little crystals growing in the pores. It maybe takes on a different texture; it's shiny, feels like a rock. And so you can start to get some information about what this mode of preservation was, and we call that permineralization, when a mineral has grown in the pore space of an original part of that organism. 

So the last thing we want to consider when thinking about modes of preservation is molds and casts. A mold and a cast is, basically, when you have no original chemical composition left over. So no actual piece of that organism is left in this area, and you basically just have a representative of it, again. And so a mold is basically a void space. So if you can think about it, if you push your foot into a big squishy piece of mud, you're going to get a void space there, and so that is a mold of your foot, and if that were preserved, that's a type of fossil. And so if I were to then pour plaster or pour, you know, other type of mud or clay into that void space where your foot was, and that was hardened, I could take out that three-dimensional structure, and that is a cast of your foot. The cast is kind of the positive part of that process there, and the mold is the indentation, if you will, of that organism when it keeled over and died, or that part of the body that was pushed into the mud. So we want to be able to differentiate between molds and casts. And again, how you identify that it's a mold or cast is that it doesn't necessarily have a lot of detail in that structure, because if you think about organisms, they have little veins, they have little scales, you know, they get very intricate in their structure, and a cast is sometimes just a squish in the mud. It's just kind of a print of that organism, and that's not always really detailed. So that's how you can start to clue in that's a mold or a cast. 

So one of the themes that you've probably noticed when considering a mode of preservation is that I've been referring to that that organism is buried, and so usually if an organism has a good chance of being fossilized for us to find later, it usually needs to be buried fairly quickly, and if not, that's going to affect the extent to which that organism is going to be fossilized. And so what you just want to remember is that burial is the first step in the process of preservation after an organism dies. So we just want to keep that in mind.
