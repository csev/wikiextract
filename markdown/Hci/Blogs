In Coursera program it says that the course Human-Computer Interaction has already started, but I didnÂ´t receive an email informing about the hour that the class will start. Also, despite that I have registered I personal can not link to the course, all the options are locked and is always asking me to sign up... Is anyone having the same problem?
