## Performance Measures of an Operation


###Demand

For services: $$\frac{\displaystyle{\mathbf{\text{1}}}}{\displaystyle{\mathbf{\text{a}}}}$$, where a = inter-arrival time

###Inventory 

The number of flow units in the process at a given moment in time [units]

###Processing time

How long a worker spends on a task [units of time]

###Capacity

How many units a worker can produce or how many customers a server can serve in a given time

Cap = $$\frac{\displaystyle{\mathbf{\text{1}}}}{\displaystyle{\mathbf{\text{Processing Time}}}}$$

If there are m workers/servers: Capacity = m / processing time

###Bottleneck

Process step with lowest capacity

###Process Capacity

Capacity of the bottleneck OR min{Capacity}

###Flow rate

= Minimum between demand and process capacity [units/time]

###Utilization

= $$\frac{\displaystyle{\mathbf{\text{Flow Rate}}}}{\displaystyle{\mathbf{\text{Capacity}}}}$$

_Implied Utilization_ = Demand / Capacity [%] (differently from simple utilization, _implied utilization_ can be more than 100%)

In a _service operation_ the flow rate is typically given by the demand. Since demand = 1/a (where a is the inter-arrival time) and capacity = m/p (where m is the number of workers and p is the processing time):

u = 1/a / m/p => u = 1/a × p/m => __u = p/a×m__

###Cycle Time

= 1/Flow Rate [units of time]

###Idle Time

= Cycle Time - Processing Time [units of time]

###Flow time

The amount of time it takes a flow unit to go through the process [units of time/units of product or # of customers being served]

### Per Unit Inventory Costs

= Anual Inventory Costs / Inventory Turns [%]

###Little's Law

Inventory = Flow Rate × Flow Time  [units of product]

###Inventory turn

= Cost of goods sold / Inventory [adimensional]

## Labour Measures

### Labour Content

Total amount of labour (in units of time) required by a process

### Average Labour Utilization

Total Labour Content / (Total Labour Content + Total Idle Time) 

###Direct labour cost 

= Wage rate per time unit / Flow rate per time unit

## Balancing the Line

### Takt Time

= available time / demand

### Target Manpower

= Labour Content / Takt Time [adimensional]

_Note: Make sure the same unit of time (s/m/h/etc) is used for both labour content and takt time_

##Queue Analysis

###Utilization

u = p/a×m, where p is the processing time, a is the inter-arrival time (the reciprocal of the flow rate) and m is the number of resources

_Note: u must be <= 1; any value of u > 1 is implied, not actual, utilization, as a resource cannot be utilized at more than 100%_

###Time in queue

Tq = p/m × u^{sqrt[2(m+1)]-1}/1-u × [(CVa^2+CVp^2)/2]

or $${T_q} = \frac{p}{m} \times \frac{{u\sqrt {2(m + 1)}  - 1}}{1 - u} \times \frac{{C{V_a}^2 \times C{V_p}^2}}{2}$$

where CVa = stdev(inter-arrival times)/average(arrival times)
CVp = stdev(processing times)/average(processing times)
