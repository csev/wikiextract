<h2>To add maths symbols into a discussion forum post:</h2>

For maths symbols such as the dreaded $$\dot{x}$$ have a look at http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols for the LaTeX codes then enter them in your post with <code>$$</code> on either side. For example, to enter $$\dot{x}$$ type <code>$$\dot{x}$$</code> and you can then check it in the Instant Preview by clicking the 'Render Math' button above the Instant Preview.

For a short general introduction to LaTeX math mode, see http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Math.

<h2>Useful resources on differential equations</h2>
The following links might be useful for learning more on differential equations, integrations and other heavy duty maths subjects. Thanks to all the the contributors in this thread http://class.coursera.org/conrob-001/forum/thread?thread_id=397 for their suggestions.
