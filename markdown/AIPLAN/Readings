## Course Text Books

The course can be augmented using readings from two text books, but these are not required for the course: 

* "[http://projects.laas.fr/planning/ Automated Planning: Theory and Practice]" by Malik Ghallab, Dana Nau and Paulo Traverso (Elsevier, ISBN 1-55860-856-7) 2004.
* "[http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/ Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-604259-7) 2nd Edition, 2010. Note that [http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/2nd-ed/newchap11.pdf Chapter 11: Planning] of this edition is available online.  Of course, a later edition may be used but note that chapter numbers and specific content may vary.

A number of other course readings are suggested as the course progresses, and links to freely acessible on-line PDF copies are provided where possible.
