### AIPLAN Course Meeting Locations

The <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> virtual world allows 
you to obtain a free avatar and meet with others and communicate via text chat,
instant messaging and voice.

You can try to go to one "primary" meeting area initially as show below.
If that is full try an alternative "backup" location from the list below in the
Virtual University of Edinburgh (Vue) regions in Second
Life. Communication is possible using group text and voice chat
wherever you are located in Second Life. So, you might also suggest
alternative "popup" areas to meet in smaller groups, or with others you
interact or study with.  Perhaps suggest an area for those who speak
your own language or who are in your own time zone as a regular
meeting place.

<em>This is an experimental facility and may or may not be
effective in terms of the number of participants in the course who may
wish to meet.  Please be courteous to others and help them with
technical issues.  Also don't all try to use voice at the same time of
course, that simply would not work. If you wish to speak, use a
headset and never leave an open mic and speakers as others (but
possibly not yourself) will get feedback and noise. Mute your
microphone when not speaking in any case.</em>

### Getting Started in Second Life

There are many helpful resources on the Internet to help you to get started in Second Life.

* Some guidance on Second Life setup and testing is at <a href="http://openvce.net/slchecks">http://openvce.net/slchecks</a>

* A document provided by Virtual University of Edinburgh (Vue) teachers in the School of Education's e-Learning MSc programme is: <a href="http://www.elearning.education.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/usingsecondlife_introguide.pdf">Using Second Life</a> (PDF Guide by of University of Edinburgh School of Education e-Learning MSc Programme), February 2013, 14 Pages. [<a href="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/plan/ooc/resources/Using-Second-Life-Intro-Guide-Feb-2013.pdf">Alternate Copy</a>]

* Try to get set up so that you can:

  * Login and get to a given location via an "SLurl" such as <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Vue/225/40/27/">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Vue/225/40/27/</a>
  * Move your avatar and sit down on provided seating
  * Move your camera separately to your avatar
  * See screens and media on those screens (will require QuickTime and the media/Flash plugin in the viewer
  * Use "nearby" text chat
  * Use "nearby" voice - at least to hear. Check you have a white dot over your avatar's head to confirm that voice is enabled. Go to <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Voice%20Echo%20Canyon/52/61/30">Voice Echo Canyon</a> to test if your microphone is working - and look for the green bars near the white dot.

### AIPLAN Second Life Group

Join the group to participate in group text chat and voice meetings
(which should work wherever you are located in Second Life).
Search in-world for group "AIPLAN", or paste the URL into text chat and click it:

<code>secondlife:///app/group/816a1ab5-ddc8-0c4a-f994-2983ebfbde44/about</code>

<em>Please do not misuse the group to advertise or send spam
messages to participants. We will have to remove you from the group
if you do that. Please report abuse to <a href="mailto:aiplan-abuse@openvce.net">aiplan-abuse@openvce.net</a>.</em>

### To Play Video and YouTube Videos Inside Second Life 

A common media play back mechanism in Second Life uses Apple QuickTime and it is recommended that any Second Life Viewer installation includes QuckTime.  Install it for your Operating System from <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/</a>.

Second Life video play back also often uses the "Media on a Prim" (MOAP) mechanism itself based on the <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit">QTWebKit</a> webkit library and requires a Flash plug-in to show web pages with Flash content such as for YouTube. You should install the generic Flash Player for your Operating system. See <a href="http://get2.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/">http://get2.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/</a>. You might want to untick the options to install additional software like Google Toolbar and McAfee Security Scan that are offered at the same time

Do not use Internet Explorer when using that link. If Internet Explorer is the only browser you use, please ensure that you select Flash Player for Other Browsers, because the Internet Explorer version of Flash Player is not compatible with any Second Life viewer.

One easy way to get the right plug in available is as follows:

1. Download and install the Mozilla Firefox viewer from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/</a> if you do not already have it available. It does not need to be selected as your default browser. 

2. Visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a> from within Firefox and if necessary install the Flashplayer and its associated plug in for Firefox (which is also the generic Flashplayer). Untick the box to also install Google Chrome and any optional tool bar installs if you do not want them.

3. Look at a sample YouTube video in Firefox to make sure its working and to accept any popup flash settings requests. E.g.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GfaG5-axtg">"AI Planning for Robots" on YouTube</a>.

4. Start Second Life and video play back requiring Flash such should now work on Media on a Prim screens in Second Life.

More information on this from the FireStorm third-party viewer community is relevant for any Second Life Viewer, including the Linden Lab's own viewer:

### Virtual Worlds Assets

For those interested, there are a number of open source virtual worlds assets available to let you build your own collaboration facilities and educational campuses. See

* <a href="http://openvce.net/vwassets">OpenVCE Collaboration Facilities for Second Life and OpenSim</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4PYUsWDskU">video tour</a>)
* <a href="http://universalcampus.igb.uci.edu/">"Universal Campus" - 4 mega-region OpenSim facility</a> (<a href="http://uc.onikenkon.com/">video tour</a>)
* Conversion of Universal Campus to 4 separate OpenSim regions - <a href="http://openvce.net/resources/downloads/universal-campus/">initial conversion by Ai Austin</a>

### Popup Meeting Space Virtual World Assets

You can obtain a free virtual world collaboration-orientated building to use to create a popup meeting space - for example on a sandbox region - in Second Life via <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/124830">Ai Austin's Store in the Second Life Marketplace</a>
