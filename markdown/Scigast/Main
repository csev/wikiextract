Welcome to The Science of Gastronomy course. 

Gastronomic science is a field that is ancient in practice, but modern in its details. This is indeed an area that has revolutionized the entire food service industry, and yet offers non-science students a good opportunity to appreciate all the scientific principles in action, as well as a novel form of online learning. 

Gastronomy is a subject that is emerging with more and more integration of culinary studies and science. We are sure that it will offer you a whole new experience next time to step into a restaurant learning how deception and psychology trick you to eat more and make you enjoy the entire process. The course materials will give you a taste of the key elements in food preparation and how to apply these rules to invent your own dishes. With sufficient practice, it may be the beginning of your new hobby, treating yourself and your friends with exploratory methods of cooking supported with sound scientific experimentation.
