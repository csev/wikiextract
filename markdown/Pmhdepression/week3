##Lecture 3A: What is Epidemiology?
Epidemiology 	→ Study of disease in populations
		→ Study of rates (Langmuir)
Prevalence (burden and demand)
Incidence (force of morbidity)
		→The study of disease occurrence by time place and person (Lilienfeld and Stolley)
Etiology	→ The study of causes of disease

Seven uses of epidemiology (Morris 1976):
1. The study of the history of health of populations, facilitating projections into the future
2. To diagnose the health of the community, which facilitates prioritizing health problems
3. To study the working of health services, with a view towards their improvement
4. To estimate individual risks, and how to avoid the, which can be communicated to individuals
5. To identify syndromes (collections of signs and symptoms)
6. To complete the clinical picture of chronic disease, especially as regards natural history
7. To search for causes of health and disease. 

Mostly first discover how to prevent a disease first and (much) later find exactly why that prevents a disease (ie. Epidemiology first, etiology catches up later).
Prevention has a very strong effect, a cure is great but better not to get something.

##Lecture 3B: Time, Space and Disease: The Ecological Approach 

Example of a Cholera epidemic in London late 1854. John Snow did lots of research to determine where Cholera came from. Found that it came from a specific pump. 
He looked at exceptions. For example, little deaths in the brewery or the workhouse (ie. probably not in the air).

Hard to do a similar study on depression. But Messias et al, PS, 2011 tried. Found, higher rates of social inequality give higher depression rates.  

##Cohort studies
Cohort studies look forward, case control studies look backward. 


Relative risk for Cohort studies
Relative odds for Case Control studies

Lung cancer research. First find a group/cohort then track them. 

Strength cohort studies:
* No recall bias
* Estimate incidence
* Estimates relative risks
Weaknesses:
* Expensive
* Many controls (ie. Few people with the disease lots of people without)
* Can take a long time
* Attrition bias (you may lose more or less people with the disease due to the disease) 

##Lecture 3C: Case Control Study
You find people with the disease (ex. Lung cancer) and a number of people without, but other as similar as possible. 
Can't calculate incidence. 

Brown and Harris (1987) Importance of live events on onset depression. Relative odds 8.72

Strength case control studies:
* Requires no hypothesis
* Cases can come from clinics
* Small number of controls
Weaknesses:
* Biased recall (strength) (effort after reason)
* Temporality → which came first?
* Controls may not match cases (consistency)

##Lecture 3D: The web of Causation
“The web of causation, has anybody seen the spider?” (Krieger, Social Science and Medicine, 1994)
Can we really know what causes what?
* Association, risk and cause

Why is causality important? → It can lead to prevention

How do we evaluate evidence on cause?
* Strength (of causation)
* Dose-response (more smoking leads to more lung cancer)
* Consistency (across studies, locations, era, race)
* Temporality (cause occurs before disease)
* Specificity (more convincing if one cause has one outcome. Doesn't need to be there, but helps)
* Plausibility (have a physical logical theory)

Confounding. More deaths in Florida. Does Florida cause more deaths? Or is there another reason. 
Death rate is confounded by age. 
Fix confounding by Age adjustment
There are a large number of way to adjust for confounding variables. 

Hence, the web of causation. Which of these causes is 'the' cause. And often there is no 1 cause. Epidemiology suggests clues to etiology.
