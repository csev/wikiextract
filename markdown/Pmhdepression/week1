##Lecture 1A: What is depression?
Focus on the burden of depressive disorder in the population. Framework → Public health

At least one of three abnormal moods present:
Abnormal depressed mood for at least two weeks (dysphoria) almost every day.
Abnormal loss of all interest and pleasure most of the day, for two weeks (anhedonia)
If 18 or younger abnormal irritable mood for at least two weeks

At least 5 of these symptoms:
* Depressed mood (see above)
* Loss of interest and pleasure (see above)
* Appetite or weight disturbance
* Sleep disturbance
* Agitation or slowing
* Fatigue or loss of energy
* Abnormal inappropriate guilt
* Poor concentration
* Thoughts of death or suicide

Depression the mood is NOT the same as Major Depression, the disorder.

Also: 
* The symptoms are not due to mood in congruent psychosis
* There has never been a manic episode, a mixed episode or a hypo-manic episode
* The symptoms are not due to physical illness, alcohol, medication, or street drugs
* The symptoms are not due to normal bereavement

Depression has been around for a long time. 

Sources for depressive disorder:
* Inheritance
* Stress/Loss

##Lecture 1B: Prevalence and incidence of Major Depressive Episode (MDE)
Prevalence: The proportion in the population with the illness e.g. a percentage (burden)
* Define and count the population denominator
* Count cases for the numerator from that defined population
Incidence: The rate at which new cases form in the population e.g. rate per time (for of morbidity)
* Define the population
* Define the cohort (risk set) who have never had the disorder
* Define the time period for follow up
* Count the number of person years for the denominator
* Count the number of new cases for the numerator
* Prevalence in Western cultures 10%
* Incidence in Western cultures 0.3%

Women are at higher risk and 'peak' earlier around 30 years men around 40 years. 

##Lecture 1C: The Natural history of Major Depressive Disorder (Symptomatic Course)
Once it starts, what happens?

Prodrome → Period after the disease has begun, before it is diagnosed
Onset → The beginning of the first episode
Remission → Is the end of the symptoms in an episode
Recovery → When a year has passed without another episode
Recurrence → The start of a later episode after recovery

Prodromal period can be years or decades. 
Dysphoria is experienced by 50% for 5 years or longer before the depressive disorder. 

First time depressive persons take longer to recover than with recurrence.
50% of the people recover and never have a recurrence. But the other 50% do.

Summary: 
* Prodrome can be decades long
* Episodes last several months
* About 50% of all lifetime cases have only one episode
* About 15% of all lifetime cases are unremitting (ie, have at least one episode in a year)
* About 35% of all lifetime cases have a relapsing and remitting course

Women have twice as many depressions as man. Bipolar disorder shows no sex difference in prevalence. After the first depressive episode prevalence is equal between men and women.

##Lecture 1D: Major Depressive Disorder and Medical Conditions
Depressive disorder increases risks of:
* Diabetes (due to eating problems)
* Heart attack
* Stroke
There is no relationship between cancer and depressive disorder (at least cancer in general)
Having a stroke does increase your chance of depressive disorder (a lot! And especially if the stroke is in the left part of the brain.)

##Lecture 1E: Estimating the burden of Major Depressive Disorder and Medical Conditions (Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs))
Methodology to compare the burden of a fatal disease with a non fatal disease.
Estimate the burden of disease-disability weights.

Disability weight of 0.0 = Healthy person
Disability weight of 1.0 = Death
Disability weight of 0.5 = 2 years of the this persons life compare to 1 year of a healthy person

Disability weights:
* Quadriplegia: 0.90
* Blindness: 0.62
* Deafness: 0.33
* Major Depressive Disorder (moderate): 0.35

In the world about 5% of the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are caused by unipolar depressive disorders. For the developed regions this is 6,8%. Depression is the second most prevalent DALY.
