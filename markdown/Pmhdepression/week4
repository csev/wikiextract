##Lecture 4A: Inheritance?
Slide with numbers on inheritance (1:30). There appears to be a (strong) link between inheritance and depression. There might be a link based on a cultural aspects, but belief it is genetics. (zandi et al, public mental health)
In 1-eiige tweelingen 53% both have a depression. 
About 43% of all depressions seems to be (partially) caused by inheritance.
Not been able yet to find the genes responsible for depression
'missing heritability' → we know it heritable but haven't been able to find it 
(manhattan plot, looks like manhattan)

##Lecture 4B: Stress & Diathesis

Difference between patients (people that receive some treatment) and cases (number of people who never receive treatments)

Gene environment interaction. When people do no have a significant life event they have little risk of a depression. Combined with inheritance this shows that eeneiige twins who have a twin with depression and suffering a life event have a much higher chance of depression than either the twin without a life event, and than a twin who's duplicate doesn't have a depression.

The combination of environment (stress) and genes brings on a depression. If you're more neurotic (easily stressed) you're more likely to get a depression. Combine this with high stress and it almost has to go wrong. 

##Lecture 4C: Social Supports

Confidant: Someone you can talk to no matter what the problem is. About 80% of the people have someone like that. 

The “stress-buffering” hypothesis (percent with onset of disorder)

Social support buffers the risk of stress. 
Low social support is riskier for women than for men. For men social support isn't very relevant. 
Gender argument → culturally 
Sex argument → Evolutionary reasons. 
There's no clear answer yet. 

_Summary:_
* Stress increases risk for depressive disorder
* Social supports are protective from depressive disorder
* Stress and social supports interact in affecting risk
* inherited traits interact with stress in raising risk
* Low social support is riskier for females

##Lecture 4D: Work, Family and life stage
Forest plot → Way to combine info of a lot of different researches. 

Life stage is hardly of influence on depression, except for people (women?) with children under 14, possibly due to job strain (low decision latitude, high psychological demand).

##Lecture 4E: Recency of Birth: Are we entering an “age of melancholy”

Births before 1935 have a lower chance of depression. 
Possible explanations:
* People with depression die sooner (might have some effect, but seems not a strong connection)
* Older cohorts are less introspective (may not be willing to talk about it, not be aware about it themselves)
* More treatment availability leads to better recall (diagnosis) 
* Older subjects forget more distant episodes

Shows there might really be an age of melancholy. 

Possibly:
Decline of informal social connections (eating together, entertaining, went to home of friends, etc)

It seems like not more new cases of depression, but cases with depression stay depressed for longer.
 
_Summary_
* Does not seem like we're entering an age of melancholy
* Appearance of large trends for higher prevalence in later cohorts is probably at least partly an artifact of recall
* Evidence on trends in rise in incidence is limited, but suggest there has not been a rise in incidence in the past half century
* There is evidence for a rise in prevalence for women in cohorts born about 1935-1954
* Women born in 1935-1945 entered work and married life in 1955-1974
* These cohorts of females may have greater chronicity of depression than earlier or later cohorts
* Trends in social supports and divorce may be connected to trends in chronicity of depression for women.
