A review works on the same math as humour: two half jokes are not a whole joke.

In reality, 1000 rushed half reviews might not be as useful as one thoughtful one.

In addition, when you evaluate well, you learn too.

Focusing on **quality** of reviews is much more useful (for everyone) than focusing on **quantity**.
