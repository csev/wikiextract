### Various "Hacks" for marking have popped up from within the community.  They include:
#### 1. Using the comments to report grades. (link to thread?)
#### 2. Using the comments to rewrite the essay in terms of grammar and meaning. (Additional examples anyone?)

__You can use the following syntax to correct grammar in context:__

>> \>\>this means delete text<< \[\[this means add text]] \{\{this is just a comment\}\}

__So, if this were the original text:__

>> Mary shelly using the monster to spoke her feelings about being rejected by her own father.

__Then the edited text would look like:__

>> Mary >>shelly using<< \[\[Shelley used]] the monster to >>spoke<< \[\[express]] her feelings about 
being rejected by her own father. \{\{great point!\}\}

#### 3. Using a thread as a "cybersquat" which is a place where the grading conversation can continue while respecting user anonymity. (further information?)
#### 4. The polemic "comment-o-matic" which gives comment templates for peer graders to use.

This tool is a collection of peer review comments left by someone called An Anonymous Benefactor.  [It is found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xND0XvIZZ-AXqWe3xj64jFOA2XqL_phRm8ejtLW5aWA/edit)

The controversy seems to center on two parallel arguments: 

1. Whether the peer reviewers are doing their own thinking, or just cutting and pasting reviews.  

2. Whether the comments are useful to establish a base to start from.

Whatever the original purpose may have been, the comments appear well thought out.
