Learning objectives for the week are:

#Comprehend learning theories relevant to the online environment#

##Constructivist Theory##

* Grounded in the learners being active
* Constructing and building their knowledge structures

* [Jerome Bruner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bruner), Wikipedia article
** One of the main proponents of construcitivism
** Believed that learning is the process of building or constructing concepts based on current knowledge
** Purpose of education is to build thinking and problem solving skills
** Knowledge can be taught at any level of development
** Led to the spiral curriculum - complex ideas are introduced in a simple manner at any stage
** Complex ideas can be revisited in a more complex matter later

* [Vygotsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vygotsky), Wikipedia article
** Believed (as did Bruner) that you help the child to learn by helping them develop skills (Social Constructivism)
** Scaffolding, as Bruner called it = child can achieve a specific goal through a structured environment. For Vygotsky this was called a Zone of Proximal Development
** Believed that social learning was the precursor to cognitive development


* [Robert M. Gagn√©](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Gagn%C3%A9), Wikipedia article
** 5 major categories of learning
*** verbal information
*** intellectual skills
*** cognitive strategies
*** motor skills
*** attitudes
** Each category - different conditions needed to achieve learning
** 9 events of instruction
*** gain attention
*** describe the goal
*** stimulus recall of prior knowledge
*** present material to be learned
*** provide guidance for learning
*** elicit performance
*** provide informative feedback
*** assess performance
*** enhance retention and transfer


* [John Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey), Wikipedia article
** not really a constructivist
** more of a major proponent of the Progressive movement
** fits in here because his educational beliefs revolved around active participation of the child
** curriculum has to be relevant
** learn by doing concept


##Cognitive learning Theories##
* [Gestalt Psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology), Wikipedia article
** Learning can be achieved by looking at patterns that a learner creates in reaction to the environment
** 2 assumptions:
*** memory is an organized system
*** prior knowledge is important to the learning process

* [Jean Piaget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget), Wikipedia article
** Theory had 3 components
*** Schemas - units of understanding or linked mental representations. stored and applied when needed
*** Adaptation - adjustment to the world - uses existing schema to deal with new knowledge (Assimilation) or changing existing schema because it does not work with new knowledge (Accomodation)
*** Equilibrium / disequilibrium = can accept / can't accept new information
** Disequilibrium + Accomodation = Restores the balance
** 4 stages of development
*** Sensorimotor (0-2 years)
**** Understands object permanence
*** Preoperational (2-7 years)
**** Egocentric stage
*** Concrete operational (7-11 years)
**** Understand conservation and able to classify)
*** Formal operational (11+)
**** Manipulate ideas
**** Think and reason abstractly
