# Video Lecture Notes

A wiki is a website that anyone can edit. Together, we'll use this wiki to compile notes about each of the lecture videos. When viewing the wiki page for a given lecture, click the **Edit** tab at the top right to begin editing. Be sure to click the **Save page** button at the bottom when you have finished so that others can also edit the page. While you can enter basic text into the editor, those who wish to add some formatting may wish to review this [Markdown guide](https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/Markdown_guide). Take advantage of these notes but also contribute to them!
