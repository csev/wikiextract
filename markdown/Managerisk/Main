World Bank CEO [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecnl3up-8JM Jim Kim] says that [https://www.google.com/search?site=&source=hp&q=kim+%232030now+risk&oq=kim+%232030now+risk&gs_l=hp.3...4444.10900.0.11194.18.18.0.0.0.0.347.1851.7j7j0j1.15.0....0...1c.1.48.hp..13.5.642.0.v7y5Omn2Mt0 #2030now] good news about the millennial generation's defining social movements is every type of practitioner is needed in massive collaboration. Help list some reasons why this applies particularly to managing risk

Back in 2000, [http://unseenwealth.net Unseen Wealth] Research published by [https://www.google.com/search?site=&source=hp&q=%22unseen+wealth%22+blair+georgetown&oq=%22unseen+wealth%22+blair+georgetown&gs_l=hp.12...2991.17522.0.20846.35.34.1.0.0.0.244.3927.11j19j3.33.0....0...1c.1.48.hp..13.22.2647.0.oELlRTmmlmk Brookings and chaired by Georgetown Law School] showed that all the professions that had got biggest in globalisation between 1984 and 2000 had omitted to value compound impacts of risk in "whole truth" ways. Until this was transparently sorted out, we were entering a decade of suddenly collapsing systems. From dotcoms, to virtual utilities like Enron and worldcom, to the demise of the big accountant andersen, to the collapse of wall street banking - all of these and more are exponential consequences of not integrating risk into auditing at the same cyclical frequency that big decision make judgments on other dynamics of economics of value exchanges, and extracting profits in particular. Only worldwide citizens having enough true understanding of exponential risks intergenerational consequences can change politicians - see this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzEajBQ9gmQ 2009 failed attempt to scale yes you can], 

Now in 2014 lets hope millennials' post-2015 goals attempts to demand ending inequality becomes job number 1 of public servant fares more successfully.

 Please help make a list of which experts young professionals are celebrating at world bank live and other events. Where there is a compound risk story to bring out into open education curriculum, please say what you think this is

You can choose any market whose purpose matters to human sustainability - banking, energy, healthcare, food security, education , mobile apps in development race to poverty museums. If you feel there may be a gap between that sector's purpose which can most sustain people's livelihoods and improve the human lot and the biggest global organisations currently dominating the sector - then that is a compound risk problem. Let's see which sectors the [https://class.coursera.org/managerisk-001 world bank coursera on managing risk ]helps enlighten - or if one is urgent to you ,please add it to this wiki- start decsribing the gap between whole truth purpose and biggest systems currently dominating the market- and lets start searching for transparent ways to expose what risk needs remodelling. Some examples of this approach are shown for world's biggest market at [http://trilliondollaraudit.ocm trilliondollaraudit.com] For example stunned that they could be wearing garments from factories that kill 1000 people (eg Bangladesh 2013) [http://vimeo.com/86955821 a network of the world's first ladies] are demanding risk transformation of fashion sector and co-opting superstars in viralising this call.

Another co-creative way of looking at whether value chains have lost touch with communal goodwill joyfully presents itself  if you are an alumni of [http://youthcreativelab.blogspot.com Dr Muhammad Yunus] - for example take a market sector where those networking social business purpose want to compound a different future than the biggest organisations currently spinning that space- that's a problem of mediating risk that can only be solved if millions or billions of youth are aware of the crisis, and only open education platforms can now scale that economically [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=moocyunus as far as we can see]

CHARTER FOR OPEN SYSTEM INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY OF MILLENNIALS 5 ECONOMIES
I find both big bankers' politicians and drayton's social entrepreneurs totally miss the point of how not to destroy the next generation by requiring it to bailout the folie grandeurs of past generations and their professional monopolies. I dont want to introduce new vocabulary for the sake of it. If you feel the systems issues raised below are already being valued/scaled in action learning by millennial alumni of a particular leader - who?

Our model (which out of The Economist and allied with peter drucker started all modern interpretations of [http://normanmacrae.ning.com/forum/topics/unacknowledged-giant-the-economist-obituary-of-the-net-generation entrepreneurship and knowledge economy in 1972]) suggest each have different sustainability dynamics -critical to giving both women and youth more than 5% say over the future which these two halves of the populace have due to the ever lower-trust (ie non-open society)  way global bankers/politicians/consultants etc have behaved and ruled


5 Agricultural (ie both human and machine energy) Economy


4 Thing (industrial) economy


3 Everyone's access to Next main commons/infrastrucure economy (from ports to rail/roads to info superhighways)


2 Service economy - this depends ultimately on investing in people's distincitve flows/competences - because a company cant own people the corporation either under invests or negatively invests in this leaving society to pick up the costs


1 Knowledge economy- this is even more inconvenient that the service economy. While it can lead to 10 times more health and wealth than the industrial economy- it depends forst on free swaps of life critical information - note these dont even show up in short-term records of monetisation. 

In other words, 90% of the growth impact of the millennial generation's borderless planet cant be tracked by adding up gross national products in zero-sum ways. As The Economist review of the next 40 years in 1972 opined; before the "death of distance" era of networking's open technology it needs to be time to recognise the macroeconomic mindset that has grown like topsy since world war 2 as "disgraceful political chicanery"

Secondly where valuation can be placed on a knowledge network it should be calculated as never being worth more than the value it frees it customers to co-create.
when place leaders rule over laws or numbers that do not seek to integrate all 5 economies inconvenient truths spiral of the sort that put next generations sustainability at exponential risk. Unless a country's professions (and ahead of that educators) ultimately connect round doing no evil - both to internal sustainability and external sustainability in trades with neighbours - they become high priests of extraction (loss of sustainability of our next generation out of more and more communities while 1% or an ever lesser number gain). For the first 145 years of its existence The Economist mediate this do no evil and this was indeed the primary job of the Keynsian economist as the last 3 pages of his general theory concluded. To the extent that place leaders have no keynsian economic advisers transparently mapping the futures of the place, is the extent to which that place will lose next generations. We need to hope that young professionals (eg 25 to 35 year olds) worldwide -potentially the most educated , moral and feeling and connected our human race has ever seen can turn the curve on all externalising/extracting professionals. This is one of the agendas urgently uniting world youth summits inspired by such different personalities (and life long learners) as Jim Kim, Muhammad Yunus,  Sir Fazle Abed, Nobel Peace Laureates and George Soros. What could be possible open education tools like khan academy and  Coursera could race to free students around missing curricula   - both systemic and by different market sectors lead practices - these peoples life work can be trusted to celebrate

Have a second look - what do world citizens first generation need to celebrate if they are to do no evil to agents of the agricultural economy. First those peoples need their own food and other securities; second if a nation decides there is a particular type of water, food, or energy that it will not be self-sufficient in then for the future of its next generation it better be sure that it has win-win partnership with other nations of an inter-generational nature- this is exactly the opposite of what national politicians rewards and their bureaucrats and bankers monetary games now specialise in. So-called sustainability investment reports are not whole truth (ie compounding hidden risks onto next generation) unless transparency towards agricultural economy -ending poverty of its actors- is integral to the national brand or whatever level of place leadership every community's sustainability is empowered around
