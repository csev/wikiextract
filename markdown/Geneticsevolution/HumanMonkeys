"Did humans evolve from monkeys?" is a common misconception that comes from a lack of understanding of how evolution works and how all living things are related to one another. Most people who believe that humans descended from monkeys look at evolution as if it is a straight line or a ladder with "lower" animals at the bottom slowly progressing to "intermediary" animals like monkeys and finally finishing with humans at the apex. 

In fact evolution looks more like a tree with branches. At the bottom is the common ancestor and all the branches are the different species. One of these branches are humans and another close by branch are monkeys and if you trace back to where they connect that is where the lineages diverged from a common ancestral species. This makes humans appear to be on equal footing with other animals because their branch is but one among many on the tree of life.

Humans, monkeys and modern apes are distant cousins to each other. Just like a person doesn't descend from their cousin neither does a human descend from a monkey. Monkeys, humans, modern apes and extinct hominids like the Neanderthal man are all related to one another. They belong to a common group called [hominids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) who all share a common ancestral species in the past. It is from those ancestors that monkeys, apes, humans and other extinct hominids descend from.
