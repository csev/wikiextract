[[Category:Introduction to Genetics and Evolution|Links]]
This section lists various link to websites that deal with evolution and biology:

 - [Fossil Hominids](http://talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/) is a website that "provides an overview of the study of human evolution, and of the currently accepted fossil evidence".
 - [Talk Origins](http://talkorigins.org/) is a Usenet newsgroup, as described on their site, that is "devoted to the discussion and debate of biological and physical origins".
 - [The Panda's Thumb](http://www.pandasthumb.org/) is a website that is "dedicated to explaining the theory of evolution, critiquing the claims of the anti-evolution movement, and defending the integrity of science and science education in America and around the world".
 - [The Tree of Life](http://tolweb.org/tree/) is "a collection of information about biodiversity compiled collaboratively by hundreds of expert and amateur contributors. Its goal is to contain a page with pictures, text, and other information for every species and for each group of organisms, living or extinct. Connections between Tree of Life web pages follow phylogenetic branching patterns between groups of organisms, so visitors can browse the hierarchy of life and learn about phylogeny and evolution as well as the characteristics of individual groups."
