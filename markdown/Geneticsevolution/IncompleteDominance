##Definition

Incomplete dominance is the situation wherein the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype (e.g., Bb) is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes (BB and bb). For example, if BB causes a plant to grow to 10mm, bb causes a plant to grow to 4mm, and Bb causes a plant to grow to 7mm, then there is "incomplete dominance" of the two alleles at the B locus. In contrast, if Bb also grew to 10mm, then the "B" allele is completely dominant. This is also sometimes called "semi-dominance."
