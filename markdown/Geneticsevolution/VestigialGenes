Another type of retrodiction that evolution makes is the vestigial genes. Here are some of the examples of vestigial genes in humans:

 - [Genes for making yolk proteins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitellogenin) still exist in humans even though all they produce is an empty sack that isn't useful. This points to an ancient ancestor that sometime in the past needed to produce this protein but as mammals (of which humans are part) evolved into what they are today this gene was no longer needed and became a remnant of the past.
 - [Genes for making vitamin C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-gulonolactone_oxidase) are broken within humans (and guinea pigs). Humans need to consume vitamin C in order not to get a disease called scurvy however other animals do not because their genes for making vitamin C are fully functional.
 - Olfactory receptor proteins
