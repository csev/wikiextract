##Definition

One definition of evolution is a change in allele frequencies over time.

##Fundamental Processes 

Under this definition, there are two fundamental processes at work within evolution:

1. Change within a lineage
2. Formations of new lineages (splitting of an existing lineage into a new lineage)

For an example of change within a lineage we can look at the [evolution of the modern horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse). Over many millions of years the ancestors of the horse (ex. [Mesohippus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesohippus)) who stood about half a meter tall evolved into the modern horse species ([Equus ferus caballus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse)) that are now measured to be almost two meters tall.

However the modern horse species is but one of many other existing species such as donkeys and zebras that share that same ancestor. Over a long time these new species formed by splitting from their common ancestor.

##Fundamental Principles

Two fundamental principles underpin the idea of evolution:

1. Much of the evolutionary change has been caused by [[Geneticsevolution:NaturalSelection| natural selection]]
2. All species share [[Geneticsevolution:CommonAncestor | common ancestry]]

Natural selection is an important driving force of evolution that exhibits the appearance of design but although it is very well known it is not the only cause of evolution.

All living things share a common ancestor. If we were to look again at horses, donkeys and zebras we can trace their lineages back to a single common ancestor species. However we can do the same thing with any other species like birds and horses and trace their common ancestor back in time. The same can be done for horses and humans or for horses and plants. One way to consider this is that all living things are cousins to each other. Some are close cousins others are far removed cousins. The important thing to remember is that we are all related to each other to a certain degree.
