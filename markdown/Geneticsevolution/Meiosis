##Definition

Meiosis is the process for forming gametes (sperm or egg). Unlike mitosis, the daughter cells in meiosis only receive half the genetic information of the parent cell. So, sperm cells, for example, only have one copy (allele) of each gene. In humans, meiosis occurs in the ovaries (for females) or testes (for males).
