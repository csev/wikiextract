There is extensive evidence for evolution and common ancestry in the [fossil record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_record). This page lists various examples of how the fossil record demonstrates that life arose from a simple single origin and diversified through the mechanics of evolution into the different species that we see on Earth today.

- The further back we go within the fossil record [the simpler the life forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#Earliest_fossiliferous_sites) become.

- Complex life forms, such as humans and rabbits, appear only much much later within the fossil record.

- Examples ([like the evolution of a horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse)) of a species gradually changing in the fossil record into new species/forms.

- There are [various](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossils) well known "transitional fossils" that connect modern groups to their common ancestor. One of these is the [Archaeopteryx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx), a transitional form of modern birds.
