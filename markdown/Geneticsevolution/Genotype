##Definition

A genotype is the combination of alleles found in an individual. It is used in two ways: 
* Sometimes it is used referring to alleles at a single gene. Hence, your genotype might be "Bb" for the hypothetical eye color gene mentioned above. The observable appearance associated with the genotype is the phenotype: your eye color.  
* Other times, "genotype" is used to refer to the combination of alleles found in an individual across many genes. Hence, one may be Bb cc dd Ee FF across a particular set of 5 genes.
