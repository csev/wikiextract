##Definition

A phenotype refers to an individual's observable traits (genes that have expressed themselves within an individual). It is typically (though not always) used in the context of something that is controlled genetically. For example, if you are studying the inheritance of genes that affect eye color, your "phenotype" associated with those genes is your eye color. If you're studying the inheritance of height, your "phenotype" is your height.
