##Definition

Mitosis is a process where a cell divides and produces two daughter cells that are exact copies of the original. This happens in your body all the time as you grow and replace cells - the new cells are genetically identical (except for some very rare mutations) to all your other cells. Assuming you have two copies of every gene, every cell resulting from mitosis will also have the same two copies (alleles) of every gene.
