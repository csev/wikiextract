##Definition

An allele is a particular variant of a gene, differing in DNA nucleotide sequence from other variants of the same gene. For example, imagine there is one gene affecting eye color that has two variants (alleles) - one that causes eyes to turn brown and one associated with blue eyes. The two alleles differ slightly in their DNA nucleotide sequence, and that's what makes them associated with the different eye colors. For simplicity, we often symbolize alleles at a single gene with letters - perhaps "B" for the one that makes eyes turn brown and "b" for the one associated with blue eyes. Humans will have some combination of two variants (alleles) of this gene (assuming it's not on the X or Y-chromosome): BB, Bb, or bb. In principle, your mom may have the two B alleles (BB) and your dad may have the two b alleles (bb). If so, then you would have inherited one from each parent, and thus be Bb.
