"Missing link" is a term used by evolution deniers to try to convince others not to believe in the theory. More correctly termed "transitional fossil", the geologic record has improved since the time of Darwin. Some species, such as whales and horses have a complete series of examples of their evolution. 


The idea of a 'missing link' is less important than it was in the past. It is now recognized that all living things are transitional or headed for extinction. The recent ability to easily sequence genomes has made it possible to directly compare living (and some recently extinct) forms to each other to estimate their degree of relatedness.
