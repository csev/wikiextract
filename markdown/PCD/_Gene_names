***ced-1***: *ced-1* encodes a transmembrane protein that functions to initiate a signaling pathway in phagocytic cells that promotes cell corpse engulfment and phagosome maturation. Loss of function mutation ***(e1375)*** results in persistent corpses. *e1735* was used for screening for supressors of cell death by Hillary Ellis. The screen by Hillary Ellis identified the two loss of function alleles of *ced-3:* ***n717*** and ***n718*** 

  
***ced-2***: *ced-2* gene encodes a Src homology (SH) 2 and 3-containing adaptor protein, homologous to human CrkII, that is required for phagocytosis during programmed cell death. CED-2 functions in the engulfing cell during apoptosis. Loss of function mutation results in persistent corpses.  

  
***ced-3***: *ced-3* encodes a caspase, a cysteine-aspartate protease. CED-3 activity is required for execution of apoptosis and functions in a conserved genetic pathway with CED-4, CED-9, and EGL-1 to regulate apoptosis during *C. elegans* development. Loss of function mutations, as identified in the screen by Hillary Ellis ***(n717)*** and ***(n718)***, results in defects in general apoptosis and causes inappropriate survival of cells that are destined to die. Weak loss of function allele ***(n2427)*** was used by Michael Hengartner to show that *ced-9* has pro-apoptotic activity. 

  
***ced-4***: *ced-4* encodes a novel protein. CED-4 is required for the initiation of programmed cell death. Genetic analyses indicate that *ced-3* and *ced-4* function upstream of *ced-1, ced-2, and nuc-1* in the programmed cell death pathway. Loss of function mutation ***(n1162)*** results in defects in general apoptosis and causes inappropriate survival of cells that are destined to die.  

  
***ced-9***: *ced-9* encodes the sole <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of the mammalian cell-death inhibitor Bcl-2. *ced-9* activity is essential for preventing cells from undergoing programmed cell death; ced-9 also appears to have proapoptotic activity; CED-9 functions by binding and repressing the activity of CED-4, a protein similar to human APAF-1 and positive regulator of CED-3 caspase activity; CED-9 localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Gain of function mutation of *ced-9 <b>(n1950)</b>* results in inappropriate survival of cells that are destined to die. Loss of function mutation in *ced-9* causes ectopic cell death. 3 mutants were identified by Michael Hengartner (***nDf40*** which is a deficiency carrying a huge deletion in *ced-9* locus, ***n2077*** and ***n2161*** that are recessive loss of function alleles). 

  
***ces-1***:  *ces-1* (cell death specification) gene encodes a small family zinc finger protein which is similar to mammalian Snail protein. Gain of function mutation of *ces-1 <b>(n703) </b>* results in specific cell death defect in NSM sister cell.


***ces-2***: *ces-2* encodes a bZIP transcription factor. Loss of function mutation of *ces-2 <b>(n732) </b>* results in specific cell death defect in NSM sister cell.

 
***egl-1***:  *egl-1* encodes a novel protein that contains a region similar to the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology region 3) domain of mammalian cell death activators. EGL-1 functions as an upstream activator in the general programmed cell death pathway and positively regulates programmed cell death by interacting directly with CED-9 to induce CED-4 release from CED-4/CED-9 complexes and ultimately activate the CED-3 caspase. EGL-1 also induces WAH-1/apoptosis-inducing factor release from the mitochondria. In hermaphrodites, *egl-1* is transcriptionally repressed by TRA-1, permitting survival of the HSN neurons required for egg laying. Gain of function mutation ***(n1084)*** results in egg laying defective phenotype which causes inappropriate death of HSN neurons in hermaphrodites. ***n487*** is another allele with a gain of function mutation. Loss of function mutation ***(n3082)*** results a in block in cell death.

***PUMA***:  *PUMA* (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis)  mammalian BH3-only gene that is a target of p53 tumor suppressor protein. Like <i>C. elegans</i> <i>egl-1</i>, the activity of <i>PUMA</i> is regulated predominantly at transcriptional level. Other mammalian BH3-only genes that are transcriptionally regulated are <i>Noxa</i>, <i>HRK</i>, and <i>BIM</i>.
