* In the last section, I introduced you to *C. elegans* and the *C. elegans* cell lineage. And I told you that every *C. elegans* worm, actually every *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, has 959 somatic cells. Remember, each of the vertical lines represents a cell. If I gave you an assignment and asked you to count the vertical lines at the end of all of the sub-lineages, you would actually come up with a number other than 959. You would come up with 1090 vertical lines and therefore 1090 cells. Why is that? What process could reduce the number of cells from 1090 to 959? Cell death! You probably guessed right. Exactly 131 of the 1090 initially formed somatic cells are eliminated again through cell death. 113 of these cell deaths occur during embryonic development. The remaining 18 cell deaths occur during post-embryonic development, during larval development, basically.  
* And just like the entire *C. elegans* cell lineage, the pattern of cell death is highly reproducible from animal to animal. To show you this, here a blow-up of part of the embryonic lineage. What you can see is that for a number of cells, there is an X at the end of the line. This X indicates a cell death. It is always the same cells that die at the same time and at the same place. The pattern of cell death in *C. elegans* is highly reproducible. 
* How do these cells die? At the cellular level, they undergo the same morphological changes that mammalian cells that die by apoptosis undergo. They lose contact to neighboring cells, they round up and condense, the nuclei become pyknotic, and eventually, they are engulfed and degraded by neighboring cells. In *C. elegans*, this entire process is very fast. Within 30-40 minutes, cells undergo the typical morphological changes, are engulfed and degraded. Dying cells can actually be seen and observed in living animals by DIC microscopy and this is shown here. 
* These refractile, button-like structures in this embryo are cell corpses, most of them already engulfed by neighboring cells. And as we will hear in one of the next sections, most of the 131 cells that die during *C. elegans* development indeed die through apoptosis. 
* Why did *C. elegans* turn out to be very important for studies on apoptosis? It's the fact that *C. elegans* has an invariant pattern of cell death. It allows you to look for mutant worms, with a different pattern of cell death In no other model organism, do you find such an invariant pattern. And it was this invariant pattern of cell death in *C. elegans* that opened up the door for the genetic and molecular dissection of apoptosis. 
* Keep in mind, this was in the late 1970's early 1980's when nothing was known about apoptosis molecularly. Bcl-2 was identified and shown to block apoptosis only in 1986/1988. In the late 1970's/early 1980's it wasn't even clear yet, whether there was a specific pathway, a specific set of proteins and enzymes that bring about apoptosis. 
* How do you find mutant *C. elegans* worms with a defect in apoptosis? Before I tell you about the approaches that were taken, I need to give you some more background. Mutations in the DNA of all living organisms occur naturally. In humans, for example, they can occur because of toxins in the food we eat, because of UV radiation, because of mistakes during the replication of our DNA. Same for *C. elegans*. Mutations occur in their DNA for a number of reasons. While these spontaneous mutations occur all the time, they don't occur frequently enough when you want to do a mutant hunt, or forward genetic screen, for, for example, mutant worms with no cell death. 
* For the purpose of a genetic screen, worms are therefore treated with mutation-inducing compounds, such as the alkylating compound ethyl methanesulfonate or EMS. EMS reacts with guanine, one of the four nucleotides that form DNA, and generates the abnormal nucleotide O-6-ethylguanine. During DNA replication, this abnormal nucleotide is often replaced with thymine instead of cytosine, which normally pairs with guanine. After another round of replication a G:C nucleotide pair can therefore become a A:T nucleotide pair. The exchange of a single nucleotide pair is referred to as a point mutation. Worms are treated with EMS in such a way that not only one such point mutation is induced in an individual worm, but many, probably hundreds, completely in a random manner. And the process of them with EMS in order to induce mutations is referred to as mutagenesis. Point mutations are small scale mutations that often affect a single gene. 
* In contrast, large scale mutations such as chromosomal translocations, deletions, or duplications can affect many genes. If a point mutation is in the coding region, the promoter region or important cis-acting regulatory regions of a gene, it can have a severe effect on the function of that particular gene. 
* What kind of effects can it have? Most point mutations, about 90%, turn out to reduce the function of the gene. They could, for example, cause the gene to be expressed at a lower level, they could make the gene product less active or less stable, or they could make the gene product completely non-functional. Such mutations are called loss-of-function mutations. 
* The loss of function can range from a partial loss of function, also referred to as hypomorphic mutation, to the complete loss of function, also referred to as a null mutation or amorphic mutation. Such a loss of function, whether partial or complete can then cause a specific mutant phenotype. The loss of function phenotype of a gene reveals the normal function of that particular gene. As you will see later, it is therefore something very important to determine, if one wants to understand the normal function of a gene in vivo. In general, loss-of-function mutations are recessive or behave in a recessive manner. 
* What does this mean? Many animals are diploid organisms. This means that in the nuclei of their somatic cells, there are two copies of each of their chromosomes. For example, humans have 23 different chromosomes and they have a pair of each of these 23 chromosomes therefore a total of 46 chromosomes. *C. elegans* has six different chromosomes and they also have a pair of each, at least hermaphrodites, and therefore they have a total of 12 chromosomes. If humans and worms have two copies of each chromosome, it means that humans and worms also have two copies of each of their genes. In the case of recessive mutations, both copies of the gene need to carry the mutation in order to see the effect on the gene's function and therefore the mutant phenotype. The animals need to be homozygous for the mutation. The reason for this is that for many genes, one normal wild-type copy of the gene or allele is sufficient to make enough gene product to fulfill the gene's function. What does wild-type refer to? It actually refers to the allele that is most prevalent in a normal wild-type population. 
* So, about 90% of EMS-induced mutations are recessive loss-of-function mutations. The remaining 10% or so are mutations that behave in a dominant manner. In the case of such dominant mutations, animals that are heterozygous for the mutation, that carry one mutant and one wild-type allele, show a mutant phenotype already. What such dominant mutations can do to the function of a gene, we will discuss later. 
* In the next few minutes, I will now tell you how forward genetic screens or mutant hunts are done with *C. elegans*. *C. elegans* hermaphrodites are mutagenized with EMS. Mutations are induced randomly in the DNA of all their cells including their germ cells. In hermaphrodites, these are both sperm and oocytes. Unlike *C. elegans*' somatic cells, which are diploid, the germ cells of *C. elegans* are haploid, which means that their nuclei carry only one copy of each of the 6 *C. elegans* chromosomes and therefore only one copy of each of the 21.000 genes that the *C. elegans* genome contains. The mutagenized hermaphrodites are referred to as the parental generation or P0.
*  They will now self-fertilize with the mutagenized diploid sperm and oocytes and form the first filial or F1 generation. These F1 worms now are heterozygous for all the mutations that randomly occurred in the DNA of the two germ cells, the sperm and oocyte, that formed the diploid zygote that gave rise to them. Since most mutations are loss-of-function mutations that behave in a recessive manner, these F1 animals most likely do not exhibit any mutant phenotypes. To see mutant phenotypes, their progeny,the F2 generation needs to be examined and screened. Often, the F1 hermaphrodite are singled out on individual petri plates for this purpose and allowed to self-fertilize again. If a F1 hermaphrodite is heterozygous for a mutation in a gene that is required for the process of interest, it will make germ cells that either carry the wild-type or mutant allele. And instead of writing wild-type, we often write the "plus" allele. If this gene is not located on the X chromosome, the sex chromosome of *C. elegans*, the ratio of germ cells, whether sperm or oocytes, carrying the plus allele or the mutant allele is 50:50. And that is because of Mendel's 1st law, the principle of equal segregation. 
* This law states that the two alleles of a gene pair segregate from one another in the formation of gametes; half of the gametes carry one allele, and the other half carry the other allele. Knowing this is actually really helpful because it allows you to predict the genotypes that you should see in the next generation and the frequencies with which they occur. Furthermore, it allows you to predict the phenotypes of the next generation and the frequencies with which they occur. This is best done using a Punnett square which probably many of you have already heard of in high school or as an undergraduate. 
* In a Punnett square, you write down on one axis all possible genotypes at a specific locus that for example can be found in the sperm. In our case, where we have a hermaphrodite that is heterozygous at our locus of interest this would mean that sperm can either carry the plus or the mutant allele. And for the oocytes, it's the same because they are made by the same animal, it is plus or mutant allele. You put this on one of the other axes. Based on this you can now predict what happens when haploid germ cells of these two genotypes come together and fuse during fertilization to form diploid zygotes of the second filial or F2 generation. You basically just fill in the squares under these axes. The outcome is +/+, +/m, m/+ and m/m. There are three different genotypes that you get, +/+, completely wild-type, m/+ heterozygous, like the F1 animal, and m/m, homozygous mutant. These occur at a 1:2:1 ratio. If m is a recessive mutation, the m/m progeny, basically one out of four F2 animals or 25% of the F2 animals, should exhibit a mutant phenotype. If the gene that is affected by the mutation is for example required for differentiation of the motor neurons that allow *C. elegans* to move in such elegant sinusoidal curves on the petri plates, then the homozygous F2 animal will no longer be able to move properly. It will exhibit what is called an uncoordinated or Unc phenotype. Now for any given, average gene and the average mainly refers to its size or length, the progeny of how many F1 animals do you need to screen to look at basically in order to find a clone, an F1 family, that carries a mutation in your gene of interest, for example a specific unc gene? Using a standard EMS mutagenesis, this number is around 1000. You need to look at the progeny of about 1000 F1 animals. And to make sure that you wouldn't miss the homozygous mutant F2 progeny, which occurs at a frequency of 0.25, you probably want to look at about 6-8 F2 animals. So you need to screen about 6000-8000 F2 animals. And depending on your assay, screening 6-8 thousand animals could easily be done in a day or it could take you a couple of weeks or more. A good assay is key, as we will see in the next sections, because it allows you to screen more animals within a certain time period and it can help you find what you are looking for.
