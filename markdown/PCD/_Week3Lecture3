Lecture 3 - Cloning of <i>C. elegans</i> <i>ced-9</i> and <i>egl-1</i>    

* How do you clone a gene in <i> C. elegans </i>?  Or better, how do you go from a mutant phenotype that is caused by a mutation somewhere in the genome of <i> C. elegans</i> to the gene whose function is affected by that mutation?  

* You use classical genetic analyses. You first use something referred to as “linkage analysis”.  Linkage analysis allows you to determine on which chromosome the mutation and the affected gene are located. Linkage analysis is based on Mendel’s second law, the principle of independent assortment.  

* The principle of independent assortment states that genes or alleles for different traits assort independently of one another in gamete formation. However, this is of course only true for genes that are located on different chromosomes. It is NOT true for genes that are located on the same chromosome. If genes are located on the same chromosome one refers to them as “linked”.  

* To do linkage analysis, you cross your mutant with a strain that has one of the six <i> C. elegans</i> chromosomes “marked” with a mutation that causes a phenotype that can easily be detected, such as an Unc phenotype or an Egl phenotype.  

* For chromosome I, for example, one often uses a loss-of-function mutation of <i>dpy-5</i> which causes the animals to have a dumbbell-shaped body. <i>dpy-5</i> gene is also good for this purpose because it is located in the middle or center of chromosome I. The F1 cross-progeny is wild-type if the mutation of interest is also recessive. The F1 animals are allowed to self-fertilize and in the F2 generation, you look for animals that are homozygous for your mutation by screening for animals that exhibit the phenotype that is caused by it. About 25% of the animals in the F2 generation should be homozygous for your mutation. You then pick those clonally and check their F3 progeny. If your mutation is not “linked” to chromosome I but is located on one of the other chromosomes, then 25% of the animals that you picked should also be homozygous for the <i>dpy-5</i> mutation and therefore give rise to 100% Dpy progeny. In addition, 50% of the animals that you picked should be heterozygous for the <i>dpy-5</i> mutation and therefore, in the F3 generation, give rise to 25% Dpy animals.  

* However, if your mutation is “linked” to chromosome I, you will not find any clones that give rise to 100% Dpy progeny. Furthermore, depending on how many F2 animals you picked and depending on how far apart your mutation and dpy-5 are on chromosome I, you may not find any or only a few clones that in the F3 generation will give rise to 25% Dpy animals. This analysis you perform with marker strains for all six chromosomes, or at least for five of them because you can do other analyses to determine whether your mutation is on the sex chromosome, the X chromosome. Together, these analyses should result in the identification of one chromosome, to which your mutation is linked.  

* The next step then is to determine where on that particular chromosome your mutation is located.  In order to find out, you perform “mapping experiments”, often “three-factor mapping experiments”. Three-factor mapping experiments are called this way because you determine where your mutation is located with respect to two known sites and therefore a specific interval on the chromosome. It will basically allow you to determine the order of those three factors, your mutation and the two known sites.  

* Mapping experiments are not based on the principle of independent assortment but on the fact that loci that are located on one chromosome do not assort independently. Sometimes one refers to this as “non-independent assortment”. Instead, loci that are located on one chromosome can only be separated from each other or newly combined through “recombination”.  

* What is recombination? During the formation of germ cells or gametes, and during meiosis, in particular, “homologous chromosomes” pair Homologous chromosomes refers to the two copies that diploid organisms have of each of their chromosomes, one inherited maternally, from the mother, and the other paternally, from the father. The two chromosome Is, for example, pair during meiosis and one purpose of this pairing is to exchange parts of their chromosomes. Through this exchange of parts of their chromosomes, new combinations of alleles can be generated and this is in part the basis for genetic diversity within species.  

* What you practically do for a three-factor mapping experiment is to cross your mutant that carries, let’s say, a mutation on chromosome I, with a strain that carries loss-of-function mutations in two genes that cause an obvious phenotype and that define a good interval on chromosome I, that are basically located around the center and that are a few “map units” apart. Map units or centimorgans are a genetic unit and are defined as 1% recombination. In 100 meiosis, one would expect to see one recombination event between two loci that are 1 map unit apart.  

* On chromosome I, you could, for example, use a <i>dpy-5 unc-29</i> double mutant. Both genes cause an obvious phenotype and together a Dpy Unc phenotype, and the two genes are about 5 map units apart on chromosome I. You cross your mutant with this mapping strain and let the F1 self-fertilize. In the F2 generation, you now look for recombinants. Most animals will not be recombinants. They will either be wild-type, Dpy Unc, or exhibit the phenotype cause by your mutation.  

* How can you look for recombinants? You look for animals that are Dpy but not Unc and for animals that are Unc but not Dpy. Such animals have a recombinant chromosome in them and one where the recombination took place between <i>dpy-5</i> and <i>unc-29</i> in particular. You pick these recombinants, you make the recombinant chromosome homozygous in the next generation and then you ask the questions whether the recombination that took place “picked” up your mutation or not.  

* Analyzing all recombinants this way, you should be able to determine whether your mutation is to the left of the dpy-5 unc-29 interval, in the interval, or to the right of the interval. Apart from being able to determine the order of the three loci, you will be able to get an estimate of the distance between the known loci and your locus.  

* Once you know where your mutation is located, you pick another appropriate interval with the goal of narrowing down the region on chromosome I to which your mutation localizes.  Once a small region has been identified, the next step is to determine whether the DNA that covers this region isolated from wild-type animals can “complement” or “rescue” the mutant phenotype, the phenotype that is caused by your mutation.  

* You perform something referred to as “transformation rescue experiment”. By the way, for these rescue experiments, which are really critical for the identification and cloning of genes, it is also important to know what kind of mutation you are working with. The type of mutation, whether loss-of-function, hypermorphic, gain-of-function, or neomorphic mutation will determine the strategy that you will need to use to find your gene of interest.  

* In the early 1990’s the <i> C. elegans </i> genome had not been sequenced yet. However, what was available already at the time was a collection of hundreds of overlapping cosmids, each containing a fragment of the <i> C. elegans </i> genome of about 20-40 thousand base pairs in length. And this collection of cosmids had been mapped or hooked up to the genetic map through genes that were already cloned and identified. Once one had identified a small genetic region through mapping experiments, one could go to that collection and see which cosmids  covered that small genetic region. These cosmids were then used for rescue experiments.  

* Basically, they were injected into the gonads of the mutant of interest, either singly or in pools, to generate transgenic lines carrying these cosmids on extra-chromosomal arrays, and to identify the cosmid that was able to rescue the mutant phenotype. And “rescue” meant that the transgenic animals no longer exhibited the mutant phenotype but now, instead, were wild-type again.  

* Once a cosmid was identified, subclones of this cosmid were generated, containing shorter and shorter DNA fragments, to identify the “minimal rescuing fragment", which then was sequenced to determine what transcription units were potentially located in that fragment. If a transcription unit or gene could be identified that way, it was then sequenced in the mutant strain to identify the molecular lesion caused by the mutation. To find the mutation that causes the mutant phenotype in the first place is important to do to confirm that the correct gene has been identified.  

* To clone a gene, to do linkage and mapping experiments, and to perform transformation rescue experiments could sometimes take many months and even years. And not all mutations behave as they should or are located in parts of the genome that are not that easy. Things have changed quite a bit since the early 1990’s and nowadays, if things go well, you can go from the mutant phenotype to the affected gene and the mutation in a couple of months.  

* I just want to mention a few of the important improvements that really helped forward genetics and that are making the lives of <i> C. elegans </i> researchers simpler today. In 1998, the <i> C. elegans </i> genome sequence became available and for this, the set of overlapping cosmids that I just mentioned was used. One therefore didn’t need to sequence the minimal rescuing fragment any longer and could right away zoom in on the genes or transcription units.  

* Around the same time, RNAi, RNA-mediated interference became available as a new method to inactivate gene function in worms in a targeted manner. That really helped to speed up things once a genomic region had been identified.  

* Furthermore, A <i> C. elegans </i> strain isolated from Hawaii was sequenced and found to be polymorphic to the <i> C. elegans </i> strain isolated in Bristol, UK. About 1 out of every 1500 base pairs is different in the Hawaii strain. And this polymorphic strain is now used for doing linkage and mapping experiments at once. This is called “SNP mapping”, which stands for “single nucleotide polymorphism-mapping”. What’s the advantage?  

* The advantage is that you can map your mutation not only to other, known mutations that cause an obvious phenotype, such as mutations in <i>dpy-5</i> and <i>unc-29</i>, but to any of those thousands of single nucleotide base pairs that are different between the Bristol genome and the Hawaii genome, the polymorphisms between these two strains. This was also a significant advance.  

* And finally for the last few years, sequencing genomes has become cheap especially for a small genome such as the <i> C. elegans </i> genome. It costs less than $1000 dollars to sequence the genome of a <i> C. elegans </i> strain now. This was mainly due to the development of new sequencing technology, deep sequencing basically.  

* The way mutations that were identified in forward genetic screens are identified and the affected genes cloned now is that you cross your mutant to the Hawaii strain and in the F2 generation you identify your homozygous mutant animals. These F2 animals are pooled, their genomic DNA isolated and sequenced. The sequence will reveal the chromosome, the region of the chromosome and the transcription unit or the gene where it is located and even identify the exact mutation. This is great! And it really has made life much easier for <i> C. elegans </i> researchers!  It also has brought back forward genetic screens into the limelight of gene discovery in <i> C. elegans </i>.  And I suspect that the same will happen for other model organisms as well.  

* If things are so simple and fast now, why did I tell you about how it was done 20 years ago? How gene cloning was done? We still need to perform genetic analyses and it is critical to understand the concept of linkage and mapping. It’s important to construct new combinations of mutations for epistasis analyses, for example, but also for other experiments. It’s important to know and once you understand it, you can apply it to any process and any genetic model.  

* Finally, coming back to the <i> ced-9 </i> gene. Michael Hengartner cloned the <i> ced-9 </i> gene and found, maybe not too surprising anymore, that it shares sequence similarity with bcl-2. The amino acid sequence of the CED-9 protein is 23% identical to that of the human Bcl-2 protein. <i> ced-9 </i> and bcl-2 are homologous proteins!  

* This was the first evidence that the pathway involved in apoptosis is conserved at the molecular level from worms to human.  The cloning of <i> ced-9 </i> was published in 1994 in the journal Cell and in their discussion, Hengartner and Horvitz state that: “It therefore seems reasonable to propose that not only <i> ced-9 </i> but also the entire pathway in which <i> ced-9 </i> acts has been conserved through evolution” (Hengartner and Horvitz, 1994).  

* A couple of years later, the <i> egl-1 </i> gene was cloned. Remember, <i> egl-1 </i> has pro-apoptotic activity and genetically, it acts upstream of <i> ced-9 </i> to negatively regulate <i> ced-9 </i> function. <i> egl-1 </i> turns out to encode a small protein with no obvious sequence similarity to any other protein but with a BH3 domain. The EGL-1 protein is a BH3-only protein that is functionally homologous to the mammalian sensors, such as Bad.
