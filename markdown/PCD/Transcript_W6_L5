# Week 6:  6.5 - Non-apoptotic functions of caspases and the central pathway  
  
* For caspases, a number of non-apoptotic functions have been described as well. These non-apoptotic functions are, for example, in immunity, cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell differentiation. During cell differentiation, caspases are involved in processes such as the regulation of differentiation programs through the control of transcription factors, but also the regulation of neuronal differentiation through the control of the shape of dendrites and dendritic pruning or degeneration, in particular. And dendrites are branched projections or processes of neurons through which neurons receive signals from other neurons.   
* A lot of information concerning the non-apoptotic functions of caspases has actually come from studies using the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model. I actually have not talked about the central apoptosis pathway in *Drosophila* yet, but I would like to summarize the basics here in a few sentences. For those of you who are interested in learning more, at the end of this section I will give some references to review articles.   
* Like in *C. elegans* and mammals, the activation of caspases represents the point of no return for the apoptotic process. And like in mammals, in *Drosophila*, caspase cascades with initiator and effector caspases are activated during the apoptotic process. However, whereas Bcl-2-like members and an Apaf-1-like adaptor exist and while cytochrome c release has been observed in some instances, caspase activation often appears to be controlled through a mechanism that is independent of Bcl-2-like proteins, Apaf-1-like adaptors and cytochrome c release.   
* Instead, caspase activation is regulated at the level of caspase activity itself. Specifically, in healthy, non-apoptotic cells, IAP proteins (and IAP stands for 'inhibitor of apoptosis protein') bind to pro-caspases such as Dronc, an initiator caspase, or Drice and Dcp-1, two effector caspases, and prevents their activation through a process that is still not quite clear.   
* Since IAP proteins can mediate the ubiquitinylation of caspases it was originally thought that IAP proteins cause the proteosomal degradation of caspases however that does not seem to be the case. As long as IAP proteins bind to pro-caspases, pro-caspases cannot be activated. Once a cell receives pro-apoptotic stimuli, these pro-apoptotic stimuli lead to the inactivation of IAP proteins.   
* One mechanism through which this is accomplished is through the expression of the proteins hid, reaper and grim, which can bind to IAP proteins and thereby prevent them from interacting with pro-caspases. Free pro-caspases are then able to become active and consequently, the cell becomes irreversibly committed to the apoptotic fate.   
* One beautiful example of how caspase activation in *Drosophila* is involved in a differentiation process is the differentiation of spermatids. And this work was done by Herrmann Steller, Eli Arama and their co-workers. In flies, but also in mammals, most of the cytoplasmic organelles and content are eliminated from spermatids during the final step of differentiation.   
* In *Drosophila*, this is accomplished by an actin-based complex, the 'individualization complex', which moves along a package of 64 interconnected spermatids. As it moves along the spermatids from their heads to their tails, this complex helps to extrude cytoplasmic content out of the spermatids. By doing so, it also promotes the individualization of the spermatids by eliminating existing cytoplasmic bridges between them.   
* This process, which is referred to as 'individualization process', is dependent on the activation of caspases. However, caspases are not activated everywhere for this purpose. They are activated in a very controlled and spatially restricted manner. They are only activated in the top half of the spermatids, from the head region about half way down.   
* How is that accomplished? Are the IAP proteins inactivated by hid, reaper and grim in the top region of the spermatids only? It turns out that during spermatid differentiation, a different mechanism is used to inactive IAP proteins. What happens is that dBruce, the IAP protein, which keeps caspases in spermatids in check, becomes substrate for an E3-ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitinylation of dBruce and its subsequent degradation via the proteosome.   
* The proteosome is another major site of cellular degradation. Through another level of regulation, which involves an inhibitor of this E3-ligase complex, a gradient of E3 ligase activity is generated, which results in a gradient of caspase activation with the strongest activation in the head region and little or no activation towards the tail region of the spermatids. Proteins with apoptotic functions can have non-apoptotic functions and we now talked about Bcl-2-like proteins and caspases.   
* The example of how caspase activation in *Drosophila* is required for spermatid differentiation brings me to something else that I would like you to be aware of. And that is that not only can proteins with apoptotic functions have a non-apoptotic function, but parts of the central apoptosis pathway or even the entire central pathway can sometimes be used for a non-apoptotic purpose. For example, it can be used for the programmed elimination of cellular content.   
* I will tell you about two examples from mammals where this appears to be the case. I should also say that we know very little about the molecular mechanisms that mediate programmed elimination in these two cases or any other similar cases that have been described so far. There are at least two types of cells in the mammalian body that lack nuclei and most cellular organelles and that therefore are referred to as 'enucleated' or 'denucleated' cells. Any idea what type of cells these could be? It is red blood cells also referred to as erythrocytes and it is fiber cells in the eye lens.   
* As I just said, both processes are not very well understood; however, in both cases aspects of the apoptotic process appear to play a role in the specific removal of nuclei and organelles. Remember, normally the apoptotic process results in the elimination of entire cells.   
* In the case of the enucleation of red blood cells or the denucleation of the fiber cells, it is only certain components of the apoptotic pathway that appear to be activated in order to eliminate in a programmed manner specific cellular content. Enucleation is the last step during erythropoiesis, the differentiation process that generates red blood cells. What happens is that the nucleus as well as other cellular organelles literally become extruded from the red blood cells through the plasma membrane.   
* Why do these cells want to get rid of their nuclei and organelles? It's basically to make more room for hemoglobin, the molecule that is so important for the delivery of oxygen to all of our tissues. Once extruded, at least the nuclei are then engulfed by macrophages. Inside macrophages, the DNA in the engulfed nuclei is degraded by the lysosomal nuclease DNase II, which is the nuclease that completes the DNA fragmentation and degradation process also in apoptotic cells that have been engulfed and that have entered the phagolysosomal system of the macrophages.   
* Caspases also seem to be activated during red blood cell differentiation and they appear necessary for this process. What is still unclear is whether active caspases are required for example to generate something like an eat-me signal on the nuclei before they are extruded. In the case of fiber cells in the lens, it is not only nuclei and other cellular organelles but also house keeping enzymes that are eliminated. And the elimination does not appear to occur through extrusion but through degradation.   
* The DNA in the nuclei is fragmented during nuclei elimination in this case as it can be detected by the TUNEL assay. However, it is unclear which nuclease or nucleases are responsible since CAD as well as DNAse II are not expressed in fiber cells. However, what is expressed in the fiber cells are Bcl-2 and caspase 9 and the over-expression of Bcl-2 can disrupt the differentiation of the fiber cells.   
* Based on this observation it has been speculated that parts of the apoptotic pathway are again used to eliminate nuclei and cellular organelles from fiber cells. Much needs to still be learned about how aspects of apoptosis are not only used to eliminate entire cells but to modify cells in a way that is necessary for their function. This is definitely one of the most interesting questions for the future. If you are interested in reading more about non-apoptotic functions of caspases here are two recent reviews from Eli Arama and Masayuki Miura, who have done a lot of work on this interesting topic in *Drosophila*.
