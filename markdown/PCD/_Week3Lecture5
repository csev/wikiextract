Week 3, Lecture 5 - <i> C. elegans </i>, <i>ced-3</i> and mammalian ICE (The caspase story)

* Two components of the genetic pathway in <i> C. elegans </i> encode members of the Bcl-2 superfamily, <i>egl-1</i> and <i>ced-9</i>. What do <i>ced-4</i> and <i>ced-3</i> encode?  

* The <i>ced-4</i> gene was cloned even before the <i>ced-9</i> gene and, at the time, it turned out to encode a protein of 546 amino acids with no similarity to any other protein in the databases and also with no known motifs. Junying Yuan in Bob Horvitz’s lab, who had cloned <i>ced-4</i>, teamed up with colleagues in the Horvitz lab and also cloned the <i>ced-3</i> gene a couple of years later. And with the cloning of <i>ced-3</i>, she hit the jack-pot.  

* The <i>ced-3</i> turned out to encode a protein that had significant similarity to a protein in the data base and this protein had already been shown to have a specific enzymatic function. This protein was mammalian ICE, which stands for interleukin-1&beta;-converting enzyme. And ICE had already been shown to be a cysteine protease.  

* Proteases are enzymes that can cleave peptide bonds between amino acids and therefore proteins. Cysteine proteases are proteases that have in their active site, the site that is essential for peptide-bond cleavage, a cysteine. Overall, the nematode CED-3 protein shares 29% amino acid identity with human ICE. What was known about ICE?  

* ICE had been shown to cleave the inactive precursor of interleukin-1 &beta;, a signaling molecule. Furthermore, it had been shown that ICE cleaved interleukin-1&beta; between an aspartic acid residue at position 116 of the interleukin-1&beta; sequence and an alanine residue at position 117.  

* In addition, it was known that ICE is synthesized as a pro-enzyme or zymogen which needs to be activated by proteolytic cleavage. This cleavage is done by mature, active ICE protease and the cleavage occurs at four aspartic acid residues within the ICE protein.  

* The mature ICE protease is composed of two subunits, a p10 and a p20 subunit. Interestingly, two of the four cleavage sites within the ICE protein sequence were conserved within the CED-3 protein sequence, which suggested that the CED-3 protein might be activated through proteolytic cleavage as well Indeed, Ding Xue in the Horvitz lab subsequently showed that the CED-3 protein indeed is a cysteine protease that is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and that becomes activated by proteolytic cleavage at three aspartic acid residues. Cleavage at these sites generates a p17 subunit and a p15 or p13 subunit, which together form the fully active protease. Just like for ICE, this proteolytic cleavage is done by the CED-3 protease itself. This was great!  

* <i>ced-3</i>, which is required to irreversibly commit cells to the apoptotic fate, encodes a protease, an enzyme that can irreversibly cleave other proteins. Furthermore, this protease is made as an inactive zymogen that needs to be matured in order to become fully active. Could it be that it is present as an inactive zymogen in all cells and that it is activated specifically in those cells that are programmed to die? Could it be that its activation represents the point of no return? What are the substrates of these proteases? What proteins do they cleave?  

* When <i>ced-3</i> was cloned there was another important question that needed to be answered and that question was whether ICE or ICE-like proteases also could commit cells to the apoptotic fate and induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. Basically, is the role in apoptosis of cysteine proteases, such as <i> C. elegans</i> <i>ced-3</i>, conserved?  

* So that’s what Junying Yuan decided to work on next, once she had her own lab at Harvard. And the way she and her co-workers addressed this important question was by generating a number of different ICE and <i>ced-3</i> constructs and by expressing those under the control of a strong promoter, an actin promoter, in rat fibroblasts grown in culture. The morphology of cells expressing the various constructs was then analyzed using light microscopy to determine whether they acquired a morphology typical of cells undergoing apoptosis. And what they found was very significant.

* First, they found that, yes, the expression of ICE in these cells could induce apoptosis. And required for this were both subunits, the p10 and the p20 subunit, as well as the active site cysteine.  ICE can induce apoptosis in mammals and its ability to do so is dependent on its protease activity. The role of cysteine proteases in apoptosis is therefore conserved from worms to human.  

* Second, they found that the expression of <i> C. elegans</i> CED-3  in these cells also induced apoptosis. And again, the active cysteine of CED-3 was required for its ability to do so. The protease activity of CED-3 is therefore also critical for its function in apoptosis. The fact that <i> C. elegans </i> CED-3 could induce apoptosis in mammalian cells furthermore suggested that ICE and CED-3 might have similar substrates and that the cleavage of these substrates might be important for a cell’s commitment to the apoptotic fate.  

* Finally, apart from expressing these different ICE and CED-3 constructs in normal rat fibroblasts, they also  expressed them in rat fibroblasts in which bcl-2 was overexpressed. Bcl-2 is homologous to <i> C. elegans </i> <i>ced-9</i> and in the <i> C. elegans </i> pathway, <i>ced-9</i> acts upstream of <i>ced-3</i>. If <i>ced-9</i> is active, <i>ced-4</i> should be inactive and so should be <i>ced-3</i>. Based on this one might speculate that in rat fibroblasts in which Bcl-2 is overexpressed, the expression of  either ICE or CED-3 might not be as effective in inducing apoptosis. And that’s what they found!  

* The expression of bcl-2 blocked ICE-induced apoptosis in these cells almost completely. In the case of <i>ced-3</i>, the effect was much weaker but some suppression was observed. This was an important finding! While quite a bit was known about the Bcl-2 superfamily at that time, that there are pro- and anti-apoptotic members, that there are sensors, guardians and effectors, that they localize to mitochondria, and that they can bind each other.  However, what was still completely unclear was what all this was good for, what the Bcl-2 family was actually regulating.  

* The result in rat fibroblasts suggested that the Bcl-2 family members were involved in controlling the activities of ICE-like and CED-3-like cysteine proteases! How they did this was still completely unclear.  

* The cloning of <i> C. elegans </i> <i>ced-3</i> and the work with mammalian ICE that demonstrated that the function of cysteine proteases in apoptosis was conserved were published back to back in the journal Cell in 1994. These two papers were seminal and they moved the apoptosis field a big step forward.  

* <i> C. elegans </i> CED-3 and mammalian ICE  represent the first members of a family of cysteine proteases now referred to as “caspases”, which stands for cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases. In <i> C. elegans </i>, there is <i>ced-3</i> and there are three additional CED-3 -like caspases, whose functions are currently being analyzed; however, they do not have a function that is redundant with that of <i>ced-3</i>. As of 2011, there were 10 caspases in humans and at least seven of them have a role in apoptosis.
