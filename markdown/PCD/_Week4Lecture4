#Week 4, Lecture 4 - Comparing the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in <i>C. elegans</i> and mammals  

* With the identification of cytochrome c, Apaf-1 and caspase-9, a picture was emerging of the molecular events that lead to the irreversible commitment of a mammalian cell to the apoptotic fate. Apoptotic stimuli lead to the activation of sensors, which results in the direct or indirect activation of the effectors of the Bcl-2 superfamily, Bax and Bak. Once activated, Bax and Bak cause a selective permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane through a mechanism that is still unknown. This permeabilization allows cytochrome c release from the inter-membrane space into the cytoplasm.  

* The binding (in the cytoplasm) of cytochrome c to Apaf-1 monomers triggers apoptosome assembly. The assembled apoptosome facilitates the activation of the initiator caspase caspase-9, which (once fully active) cleaves and activates the effector caspase, caspase-3. The activation of caspase-3 can be considered the point of no return, the event that irreversibly commits a cell to the apoptotic fate.  

* Active caspases induce the processes that lead to molecular changes typical of apoptotic cells, such as PS externalization and DNA fragmentation, which altogether result in the dismantling of the cell, and its engulfment and degradation. How conserved are these molecular steps in the worm, in <i>C. elegans</i> ?  

* Let’s look at the genetic pathways in worms and mammals and compare them. Then let’s see what we known about each of the steps at the molecular level. And let’s start at the bottom.  

* In mammals, a cascade of caspases is activated in response to apoptotic stimuli. However, in <i>C. elegans</i> , it appears to be just one caspase, CED-3, that is activated.  

* Why a cascade of caspases in mammals but not in <i>C. elegans</i> ?  A cascade of caspases may allow the amplification of the apoptotic signal, like a snow ball effect. It may also allow for additional regulation. Since cells undergo apoptosis very fast in <i>C. elegans</i> , within less than an hour, compared to (presumably) many hours or even days in mammals, an amplification step and additional levels of regulation may not be necessary in <i>C. elegans</i> . But that’s just a speculation.  

* Let’s move up one step. Apaf-1-like proteins are required for the activation of the first caspases in both pathways. And in both pathways, these proteins assemble into an apoptosome, which is required for the activation of the caspases.  In one of the last sections, I told you about the structure of the mammalian apoptosome as determined by cryoelectron microscopy of single apoptosome particles at a resolution of 12.8 angstrom.  

* In 2010, Yigong Shi and co-workers published a crystal structure of the <i>C. elegans</i>  apoptosome at a resolution of 3.55 angstrom. So, with much better resolution and therefore more detailed structural information.  Interestingly, the <i>C. elegans</i>  apoptosome turns out to be octameric. It is a circular structure with eight rather than seven spokes.  

* Furthermore, rather than a flat, wheel-like form - as had been suggested by the structural studies on the mammalian apoptosome - the crystal structure of the <i>C. elegans</i>  apoptosome suggests a funnel- or cone-shaped form.  

* And finally, rather than up to eight molecules of pro-CED-3, the <i>C. elegans</i> apoptosome appears to bind only two pro-CED-3 molecules. This binding is mediated through the CARD domains present in both, pro-CED-3 and CED-4. The two pro-CED-3 molecules bound per apoptosome presumably are forced to dimerize, which then leads to their cleavage in trans and their full activation.  

* So far, everything seems to be quite conserved at the molecular level. However, moving even more upstream in the pathways, things start to become different.  In the mammalian pathway, there is cytochrome c upstream of Apaf-1.  However, there is no cytochrome c upstream of <i>ced-4</i> in the <i>C. elegans</i> pathway.  

* The difference between the mammalian apoptosome and the <i>C. elegans</i> apoptosome is in the way their assemblies are regulated. Remember, the assembly of the mammalian apoptosome is dependent on cytochrome c binding to monomeric Apaf-1 in the cytoplasm.  And the availability of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm is controlled by the Bcl-2 superfamily and the effectors Bax and Bak, in particular. Therefore, in mammals, the Bcl-2 superfamily indirectly regulates apoptosome assembly by controlling cytochrome c release.  

* However, the <i>C. elegans</i> apoptosome can assemble in the absence of cytochrome c. The crystal structure was generated just with CED-4. Therefore, apoptosome assembly in <i>C. elegans</i> is not dependent on the availability of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm. How is it regulated then? And does the Bcl-2 superfamily play a role in it as well?  

* Yes, the Bcl-2 superfamily does play a role! And it even plays a direct role. It turns out that, in <i>C. elegans</i> , the assembly of the apoptosome is not actively induced in cells that are destined to die by apoptosis but is actively blocked in healthy, non-apoptotic cells. In those cells that are then destined to die, this block is relieved, allowing apoptosome assembly and pro-CED-3 activation.  

* How is apoptosome assembly actively blocked in healthy, non-apoptotic cells? It is blocked through a direct, physical interaction between the guardian CED-9 and CED-4. In 1997, a number of investigators independently reported that CED-9 and CED-4 can interact. Therefore, in <i>C. elegans</i>, the Bcl-2 superfamily and CED-9 in particular DIRECTLY regulate apoptosome assembly.  

* Interestingly, a few months after these findings were published, it was reported in two independent publications that, similar to what had been observed in <i>C. elegans</i>, mammalian Bcl-XL and Apaf-1 physically interacted. The authors’ conclusions were mainly based on observations made with tissue culture cells that over-expressed both Bcl-XL and Apaf-1.  

* So, maybe there are two ways to trigger apoptosome assembly in mammals? Is there both a direct and an indirect way?  No, there appears to be only the INDIRECT way, mediated through cytochrome c release. A year after it was claimed that Bcl-XL can interact with Apaf-1, three independent reports refuted this finding. And it is now generally accepted that what had been reported, was an artifact of Bcl-XL and Apaf-1 over-expression.  

* If apoptosome assembly in <i>C. elegans</i> is blocked through the physical interaction between CED-9 and CED-4, how is the block relieved in cells that are destined to die? Again, the Bcl-2 superfamily plays an important role in that. Remember that CED-9 can also interact with EGL-1, the <i>C. elegans</i> sensor?  

* The way we think the block on apoptosome assembly is relieved is the following: in the 131 cells that are destined to die during <i>C. elegans</i> development – the sensor EGL-1 binds to CED-9. EGL-1 binding to CED-9 induces a major conformational change in the CED-9 protein. This conformational change leads to the loss of the CED-4 binding surface in the CED-9 protein and, consequently, the release of CED-4 from the CED-9 protein.  Actually CED-9 binds to a dimer of CED-4 and this dimer is released upon EGL-1 binding to CED-9. Four CED-4 dimers can then assemble into an octameric structure, the apoptosome  

* The model on how EGL-1 binding to CED-9 triggers apoptosome assembly is based on biochemical data obtained by a number of investigators and also on structural data. Yigong Shi and co-workers published a series of papers in which they described the crystal structures of CED-9 alone, CED-9 bound to CED-4, CED-9 bound to a truncated EGL-1 protein, and the CED-4 apoptosome.  Not too surprisingly, the structure of CED-9 also revealed a fold very similar to that of other Bcl-2 proteins. Having structures of CED-9 with either CED-4 or a truncated EGL-1 protein revealed the dramatic change in CED-9’s conformation that is triggered by EGL-1 binding.  

* Just to reiterate, an important difference between the mammalian pathway and the <i>C. elegans</i> pathway is the way that the assembly of the apoptosome is regulated. In mammals, apoptosome assembly is actively induced by cytochrome c release in those cells that are destined to die and cytochrome c release is controlled by the Bcl-2 superfamily.  In contrast, in <i>C. elegans</i>, apoptosome assembly is actively blocked by the guardian CED-9 in healthy, non-apoptotic cells and this block is relieved by the sensor EGL-1 in those cells that are destined to die.  

* Does cytochrome c really have no role in the <i>C. elegans</i> pathway?  So far, there is no evidence that it does. However, so far, there is also no convincing evidence that it doesn’t. Mutations in cytochrome c have not come out of any of the <i>C. elegans</i> cell death screens. However, the two <i>C. elegans</i> cytochrome c genes appear to be essential for viability and the <i>C. elegans</i> cell death screens performed so far required  that the mutants be viable.  Therefore, mutations in cytochrome c genes might have been missed. Also, there are two cytochrome c genes that may act redundantly. Again, this is one more reason why mutations in cytochrome c might not have come out of these genetic screens.  

* Is cytochrome c released from the inter-membrane space in the 131 cells that are programmed to die? We have tried to determine that but ran into technical problems, which we have not yet solved.  Therefore, at least as far as I know, it is still unknown whether cytochrome c is released in cells programmed to die in <i>C. elegans</i> .  

* Fact is, that the <i>C. elegans</i> CED-4 protein is missing the WD40 domain of Apaf-1, which mediates the interaction between Apaf-1 and cytochrome c.  

* Furthermore, the <i>C. elegans</i> apoptosome can assemble in the absence of cytochrome c. 

* And why should cytochrome c be released if it is not required for apoptosome assembly?  While it is still unclear whether cytochrome c is released from the inter-membrane space in <i>C. elegans</i>, there is some evidence that another pro-apoptotic factor might be released. This factor is the <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of AIF, the apoptosis inducing factor. In mammals, AIF is released from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria concomitantly with or shortly after cytochrome c. 

* And Ding Xue and co-workers published that the <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of AIF can be released from mitochondria in response to EGL-1 expression. This observation suggests that the outer mitochondrial membrane might become selectively permeabilized in <i>C. elegans</i> as well; maybe not to release cytochrome c but AIF and potentially other factors.  If that was the case, who is responsible for this permeabilization; could it be effectors such as Bax? Remember, there is no Bax in <i>C. elegans</i>!  

* But I also told you a few sections ago that - in cells destined to die – CED-9 adopts a pro-apoptotic function. I hypothesized that CED-9 bound to EGL-1 may have a function that is like that of activated Bax in mammals. And therefore I speculate that - if outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization occurs in <i>C. elegans</i> - it might be dependent on egl-1 and ced-9. This is something we should really test.
