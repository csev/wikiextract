#Week 5, Lecture 4  Regulation of Mammalian Bid  

* The activity of the <i>C. elegans</i> BH3-only protein EGL-1 is regulated at the transcriptional level and the activity of the mammalian BH3-only protein Bad is regulated at the post-translational level through phosphorylation. How are the activities of other BH3-only proteins in mammals regulated? Remember, there are at least seven of them.  I mentioned already that the activities of mammalian Bim, Puma, Noxa and Hrk also seem to be regulated at the transcription level, similar to <i>C. elegans</i> <i>egl-1</i>. But how about Bid, for example?  

* In 1998, two papers were published back-to-back in the journal <i>Cell</i>, one by Xiaodong Wang and co-workers, and one by Junying Yuan and co-workers. Xiaodong Wang’s lab had done all the work on the Apaf proteins and had identified these important components of the mammalian central pathway using biochemical approaches.  And Junying Yuan had cloned <i>C. elegans</i> <i>ced-3</i> and demonstrated that – when overexpressed - <i>ced-3</i> as well as mammalian ICE could induce apoptosis in mammalian tissue culture cells.  

* Using different approaches, both labs obtained very similar results concerning the activation of Bid.  Junying Yuan’s lab had identified and characterized another initiator caspase, caspase-8. As I will summarize for you at the end of this section, the activation of this initiator caspase is not mediated by the apoptosome but by a different protein complex, referred to as the DISC complex. The assembly of this DISC complex occurs at the plasma membrane in response to exposure to certain apoptotic stimuli such as exposure to members of the TNF&alpha; family of ligands and TNF&alpha; stands for “tumor necrosis factor &alpha;”. Furthermore, the assembly of this DISC complex occurs independently of the Bcl-2 superfamily.  

* In order to identify substrates of caspase 8, basically proteins that are cleaved by caspase 8, Junying and co-workers employed the following strategy. They isolated messenger RNA, mRNA, from mouse spleen, converted this into what is referred to as “complementary DNA” or “cDNA”, and then divided up the pool of cDNAs, containing thousands of cDNAs representing all genes that are expressed in the mouse spleen, into 1700 different, smaller pools with less complexity. These less complex pools they then used to first, transcribe mRNA from the cDNAs and second, translate the mRNAs generated into proteins. All this can be done in the test tube, <i>in vitro</i>. At the end, they therefore had 1700 pools of a mixture of proteins that represent a fraction of the proteins synthesized in mouse spleen.  

* These mixtures of proteins were subsequently incubated with or without active caspase-8. The two reactions were then loaded side by side on a polyacrylamide gel to allow separation of the proteins contained in the mixtures by size. How can you find caspase-8 substrates this way? Maybe think about their strategy for a couple of minutes.  

* The rationale for their strategy was that if a protein contained in the mixture of proteins that were generated in vitro is a substrate of caspase-8, then it should be cleaved by caspase-8 when incubated with it.  Caspase-8-dependent cleavage would result in the disappearance of the uncleaved, full-length protein and potentially the appearance of its cleavage products in the reaction with caspase-8 but not in the reaction without caspase-8. If you ask me, I am not sure I would have picked this approach since it sounds quite challenging and technically not trivial. But it worked for them!  

* I am not sure whether they actually screened all 1700 pools but in pool 814 they identified a band that ran at about 24 kDa that disappeared  after incubation with caspase-8.  Pool 814 was then subdivided into smaller pools and the “positive” pool again and so on until they had identified a single cDNA that generated the 24 kDa protein that disappeared upon caspase-8 incubation. This cDNA turned out to code for Bid!  

* Bid is a caspase-8 substrate and therefore cleaved by caspase-8.  Why is Bid a caspase-8 substrate? Aren’t members of the Bcl-2 superfamily acting upstream of caspases to control caspase activation? Before I tell you the answers to this, I would like to tell you about the approach that Xioadong Wang’s lab used to come to the same conclusion that Bid is a caspase-8 substrate.  

* I mentioned earlier that caspase-8 is activated in a manner that is independent of the Bcl-2 superfamily and the apoptosome.  However, caspase-8 is activated, for example, after exposure to Fas ligand (FasL), which is a member of the family of TNF&alpha;-like ligands. Interestingly, Fas ligand not only activates caspase-8 but it also causes cytochrome c release. And that was kind of a puzzle, because cytochrome c release - I told you - is mediated and controlled by members of the Bcl-2 superfamily.  

* To figure out what’s going on, Wang and co-workers set out to biochemically identify the factors that were required for caspase-8 induced cytochrome c release. And for this purpose they again developed a biochemical assay. For this assay they combined HeLa cell lysate with isolated mitochondria and then to this mixture, they added active caspase-8. This resulted in cytochrome c release from the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria. With this they had an assay to biochemically purify the factors in the HeLa cell lysate that were necessary for cytochrome c release.  Using a total of eight different chromatographic steps, they identified one protein of about 24 kDa molecular weight that was sufficient to mediate cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria after addition of active caspase-8. They called this protein CCRF, which stands for “caspase-8-dependent cytochrome c releasing factor”. Very long name! What did CCRF turn out to be? Bid!  

* Now back to the question Why is Bid a caspase-8 substrate?  What is the relevance of caspase-8- dependent Bid cleavage in apoptosis?  We have so far talked about the central apoptosis pathway that exists in worms and mammals and that is also referred to as the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway.  We have discussed this pathway quite in detail and also talked about the differences and similarities between the worm pathway and the mammalian pathway.  

* However, in mammals, or more general, in vertebrates, apart from this mitochondrial pathway, a second pathway exists and this pathway is referred to as the extrinsic or death receptor pathway. And it is in this vertebrate-specific death receptor pathway that caspase-8-dependent Bid cleavage plays a role. This pathway is induced by TNF&alpha;-like ligands to which a cell might be exposed to on its exterior. These ligands can bind to “death receptors” on the cell surface of that cell, such as the TNF receptor.  

* Ligand binding causes several of these receptors to come together. Through their cytoplasmic domains, the aggregated receptors then assemble – just under the plasma- membrane- a complex, the DISC complex.  And DISC stands for death-inducing signaling complex.  

* Apart from the cytoplasmic domains of the death receptors, these complexes contain several molecules of the protein FADD. FADD can bind to the cytoplasmic domains of the death receptors on one hand and to pro-caspase-8 on the other. Through the assembly of the DISC complex, several molecules of FADD can bind several molecules of pro-caspase-8 and this allows for pro-caspase-8 activation - again through “induced proximity” or “forced dimerization.”  The purpose of the DISC complex is to cause pro-caspase-8 activation and it is therefore functionally equivalent to the apoptosome, which is acting in the mitochondrial pathway.  

* Based on the two publications by the Yuan and Wang lab, which were published in 1998, the following pathway emerged.  Once activated at the DISC complex, caspase-8 cleaves Bid, which is predominantly found soluble in the cytoplasm.  Caspase-8 cleavage generates “tBid” which stands for truncated Bid, which is about 15 kDa. tBid basically represents activated Bid, which then engages the mitochondrial pathway by blocking the guardians, such as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and by activation the effectors,  such as the pro-apoptotic Bax.  In a next step, this then leads to Bax activation, cytochrome c release, apoptosome assembly, pro-caspase 9 activation and finally, pro-caspase 3 activation.  Other substrates of caspase-8 are the effector caspases such as pro-caspase 3.  

* Why is there this cross-talk or this functional connection between the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway?  If caspase-8 can activate the effector caspases, why is it also cleaving and activating Bid?  Maybe you can think of some possible reasons why this might have evolved like this.  

* Back to the names of these two pathways in vertebrates. I prefer the names mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway.  The names intrinsic and extrinsic are somewhat misleading because they imply that the intrinsic pathway is activated by intrinsic, cell autonomous signals only.  The extrinsic pathway indeed is activated by extrinsic or cell non-autonomous signals the death receptor ligands; however the intrinsic pathway is activated by both intrinsic as well as extrinsic signals.  Intrinsic activation is for example through DNA damage in the nucleus or through cell fate signals.  And extrinsic activation is for example through the lack of growth factors such as IL-3.  

* Are both pathways present in all cells? The death receptor pathway is predominantly found and used in cells of the immune system; but not exclusively.  The mitochondrial pathway in contrast, is found in many, many different types of cells, including cells of the immune system.  It can therefore be regarded as the predominant apoptosis pathway.  

* Going back to the mechanisms through which the activity of BH3-only proteins can be regulated - I discussed the way that  the <i>C. elegans</i> <i> egl-1</i>  BH3-only protein is regulated, this occurs at the transcriptional level,  the mammalian BH3-only protein Bad is regulated at the post-transcriptional level - its activity is regulated through phosphorylation and in the case of mammalian Bid, it was found that its activity is also regulated at the post-translational level however through proteolytic cleavage. I also recommend that you watch the [following movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR80Huxp4y8) because it summarizes many things that we talked about in the last few weeks.
