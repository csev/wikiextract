# Week 6:  6.2 -  Active research on caspases   

* During week 5, I spent quite some time discussing how the most upstream components of the central apoptosis pathway are regulated.  Those most upstream components are the sensors or BH3-only proteins and I discussed the different mechanisms through which the activities of <i>C. elegans</i> EGL-1 and mammalian Bad and Bid are regulated.  

* The reasons why I spent so much time discussing these are the following:  The BH3-only proteins have a unique position in the pathway, they are the ones acting most upstream and they therefore have an important control function. They also act as integrators of the diverse signals that control apoptosis during development and throughout adult life. Their activities are also not only regulated by diverse signals but by diverse mechanisms, which makes their analysis very interesting. And finally, their regulation is still an area of active research.  

* For example, we are still trying to better understand how <i>C. elegans</i> egl-1 is regulated and two of the TAs in the course, Ryan and Sebastian, are actively working on this.  During week 4, I also discussed an area of research that is still very active and where we still are missing some important insight and that is how cytochrome c is actually released, how the outer mitochondrial membrane is selectively permeabilized and what the role of Bax and Bak is in this process.  

* Today, I want to discuss another area of active research and that concerns the very downstream components of the central apoptosis pathway, the effector caspases such as  <i>C. elegans</i> CED-3 or mammalian caspase-3.  BH3-only proteins are the target of many signaling pathways, so basically, many inputs go into them; however, they have only one or two output, which are the guardians like Bcl-2 and the effectors like Bax and Bak. In contrast to that, caspases have one major input, which is their activation through the apoptosome and/or initiator caspases such as caspase-9. However, they turn out to have many outputs. Caspases have many substrates that they cleave once they have been activated.  

* How many substrates do caspases have? Are there, tens, hundreds, thousands of substrates? And what is the consequence of the cleavage with respect to the activities of these substrates? What kind of proteins are substrates in the first place?  One of the first caspase substrates identified was PARP, the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, about which we talked in week 4.  PARP was found to be cleaved specifically in apoptotic cells and the development of an <i>in vitro</i> PARP cleavage assay enabled Nicholson, Miller and co-workers in 1995 to purify and identify mammalian caspase-3.  

* But how do you systematically identify caspase substrates? We actually talked about one approach last week, an approach that Junying Yuan and co-workers employed in 1998. Maybe take a minute or so to remember.  What they had done is the following: They translated <i>in vitro</i>, pools of proteins that are normally expressed in the mouse spleen, and they incubated these pools of proteins with or without active caspase-8. This way they were hoping to identify proteins in these pools that were specifically cleaved by active caspase-8. Remember, caspase 8 is another initiator caspase, one that is activated through the extrinsic or death-receptor pathway and whose activation is mediated not by the apoptosome but by the DISC complex. And this approach led to the identification of Bid as a substrate of caspase-8. 

* Pools of <i>in vitro</i> translated proteins from mammals, <i>C. elegans</i> or other models have since been used to identify new caspase substrates by various investigators. In most cases, one or two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to identify proteins that are cleaved by caspases <i>in vitro</i>. Nowadays, the nature of these cleaved proteins is determined by mass spectrometry. These approaches are referred to as “reverse or <i>in vitro</i> methods”.  

* Other investigators took cell lysates generated from apoptotic cells and control cells and, again using one or two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry to identify proteins that are cleaved in apoptotic cells. And these approaches are referred to as “forward or <i>in vivo</i> methods”.  

* Recently, high-throughput technology has been developed to either negatively or positively enrich for peptides that have been generated due to caspase cleavage. These high-throughput technologies have been used in combination with both the reverse and forward methods and have led to the identification of many new caspase cleavage sites in the proteome of various cell types or organisms.  

* And with proteome I refer to all the different types of proteins found within a particular cell type or organism. If you are interested, I recommend a recent review by Crawford and Wells, who developed the positive enrichment technology.  

* How many caspase substrates are there? A recent study from the Wells lab using the positive enrichment technology and mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of 257 cleavage sites in mouse, 130 cleavage sites in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and 50 cleavage sites in <i>C. elegans</i>. Most proteins identified had only one cleavage site so the number of proteins that are cleaved by caspases in the mouse is about 200 or slightly more than 200. So there are not only tens of caspase substrates but also not thousands of caspase substrates but somewhere in between.  

* New substrates are still being discovered with new methodology. For many of the substrates identified, the significance of them being caspase substrates and being cleaved during apoptosis is still unclear.  However, for some substrates, we have an idea what the functional relevance of the cleavage is. Often cleavage causes loss-of-function. The cleavage of substrates that are structural proteins, cytoskeletal elements, and enzymes involved in metabolism or transcription factors often fall into this class of substrates. Their cleavage contributes to the general dismantling of the cell.  

* What also falls into this class are anti-apoptotic proteins, whose elimination through caspase cleavage allows a certain aspect of apoptosis to be activated. And I will talk about one example in a bit more detail in a moment and that is the cleavage of the protein ICAD.  

* Caspase cleavage can also result in the gain of a particular function. For example, the activation of caspases themselves through cleavage is such a gain of function event. Another example is the activation of Bid through caspase-8 cleavage. In both cases, the pro-apoptotic activity of a protein is strongly increased or activated by cleavage.  

* Just a couple of weeks ago, a study was published that describes another factor, Xk-related protein 8 in mammals and <i>ced-8</i> in <i>C. elegans</i>, whose pro-apoptotic function is activated by caspase cleavage. I will also briefly talk about this new study in a few moments.  

* To briefly summarize what we know about the output of active caspases: New caspase substrates are still being discovered and the potential role of their cleavage in the apoptotic process characterized. The processes that lead to the typical morphological changes that apoptotic cells undergo are induced by active caspases, the loss of adhesion to neighboring cells, the shrinking of the cytoplasm, the condensation of the nucleus and the DNA, the formation of apoptotic bodies and so on. For many of these processes, it is still unclear how they are activated by caspases.  

* Furthermore, caspases activate the typical molecular changes that are observed in apoptotic cells and that we talked about during the first week.  One being DNA fragmentation or the formation of a DNA ladder through the activation of nucleases and the other being PS flipping, the externalization of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane through the activation of a flippase or scramblase. For these two processes we actually have some mechanistic understanding how they are activated by caspases. And that’s what I would like to tell you about in the next few minutes.  

* Let’s start with the specific activation in apoptotic cells of a nuclease that causes DNA fragmentation. Using biochemical approaches, Nagata and co-workers at Osaka University Medical School in Japan identified from mouse lymphoma cells a deoxyribonuclease that is activated by caspases in apoptotic cells. They called this nuclease CAD, which stands for caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease. However, while CAD activation is dependent on caspase activity, CAD itself turned out not to be a caspase substrate. How can that be? If CAD is not a caspase substrate, how can CAD be activated by caspases? Maybe think about it for a minute.  

* It turns out that CAD is activated by caspases indirectly through the cleavage and inactivation of a CAD inhibitor.  Simultaneously, Nagata and co-workers also biochemically purified a factor that can bind CAD and that is important for the correct folding of CAD.  However, this factor turns out to not only be required for CAD folding but it can inhibit the ability of CAD to enter the nucleus where the DNA is and it can inhibit the ability of CAD to cleave DNA.  For this reason, they called this protein ICAD, which stands for ‘inhibitor of CAD’.  So in healthy cells, CAD is found bound to ICAD in the cytoplasm. Once caspases become activated, they cleave ICAD. This results in the translocation of CAD from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it contributes to DNA fragmentation and DNA ladder formation through its nuclease activity.  This great story was published in two back to back papers in the journal <i>Science</i> in 1998 and I think it is a beautiful example of how active caspases induce the changes that are typical of apoptotic cells and that are necessary for cellular demise.  

* The second story was just published in July this year also in the journal Science and the work was a collaboration between the Nagata lab in Japan and the Horvitz lab at MIT in the US. In this publication, Nagata, Horvitz and co-workers showed that Xk-related protein 8 in mammals and CED-8 in <i>C. elegans</i>, both proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, contribute to the externalization of PS to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane.  

* Furthermore they present evidence that the ability of at least Xk-related protein 8 to contribute to PS externalization is dependent on its caspase-dependent cleavage. They therefore speculate that Xk-related protein 8 in mammals and CED-8 in <i>C. elegans</i> are PS flippases themselves, whose flippase activity is specifically activated in apoptotic cells by caspase-cleavage.  

* Interestingly, from the name <i>ced-8</i>, you probably guessed already that the <i>ced-8</i> gene of <i>C. elegans</i> was identified in a screen for mutants with a defect in apoptosis and that is correct. The <i>ced-8</i> mutant was identified in a screen and its phenotype is that the 131 cells that normally die during <i>C. elegans</i> development die slower than in the wild type.  It had therefore been proposed that <i>ced-8</i> is required for the correct timing of the apoptosis process. So the loss of <i>ced-8</i> does not block  apoptosis like mutations in <i>egl-1</i>, <i>ced-3</i> or <i>ced-4</i> do: the loss of <i>ced-8</i> only slows things down. And that’s an important finding.  

* The processes that are activated by caspases and that act downstream of caspases affect specific aspects of the apoptotic process, specific aspects of cellular dismantling.  The loss of these specific aspects appear to not block apoptosis per se but only cause the process to occur slower, less efficiently, in a slightly different way etc. And I think that’s the reason, why we in general know less about what happens downstream of caspases; because these processes are harder to identify and study, at least genetically.  

* PS flipping is an important aspect of the apoptotic process. Remember it’s the “eat-me” signal that tells phagocytes such as macrophages that the cell can be eaten. The paper by Nagata, Horvitz and co-workers identified one factor, Xk-related protein 8 or the  homolog <i>ced-8</i> in  <i>C. elegans</i>, that contributes to this process. In the next session, I will briefly tell you about the process of phagocytosis and engulfment, which is triggered in the phagocyte in response to PS externalization.
