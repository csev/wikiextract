##Welcome
Dear Student,

Thank you for signing up for An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python! Learning to program can be a challenging experience. Weâ€™re putting together a class on introductory programming in Python that should make this process both fun and easy.  By the time you have finished our class, we will be able to create simple interactive applications like Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids.

We expect our class to be offered in the fall of 2012. We'll notify you again when the class starts.

Yours,

Scott and Joe

##Class is now open
Dear Student,

Scott, John, Stephen and I are happy to announce that the class website for our Coursera course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" is now open. The class's homepage is viewable at 

https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-2012-001/class/index

The class website includes the first week of class materials as well as a welcome survey that we encourage everyone to take. Class will officially start on Oct. 15th, and your first quiz will be due on Oct. 18th. If you have no previous programming experience, we strongly suggest that you start looking over the first week's material this week and get an early start on the first week's activities. (A typical week has 7-8 videos, but we've included more videos in week one to provide more detail.) We'll be monitoring the class forums this week for your questions.

We'd like to conclude by sharing a little bit of our philosophy for this class. We've built a new tool ([CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org)) that will make the process of creating, saving and sharing your Python programs easy. We've designed the class curriculum to be fun (focusing on making simple games). However, learning enough programming to be "dangerous" is a challenging task. We're going to ask you to work hard (we estimate 7-9 hours a week). For our part, we have four instructors and lots of community TAs who are committed to answering your questions on the forums and helping you succeed.

We're all very excited to be offering this class, and we hope you are equally excited to be taking it. 

Joe, Scott, John, Stephen

##An Introduction to Class
Dear Student,

We hope that everyone is enjoying the class so far!

We do not want to send out too many e-mails to the entire class and create more spam for you, so we are only going to send out e-mails when there is critical information.

In this e-mail, we want to draw your attention to a few important things:

1) Please check the announcements on the main course page regularly. This has been and will continue to be our primary method of communication with the class.

2) If you are having trouble and really need someone to look over your code, try out the [code clinic](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-2012-001/forum/thread?thread_id=678). The instructors will do their best to help as many people as possible.

3) Each week, we will have a student video [tutorial contest](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-2012-001/forum/thread?thread_id=2). See this week's entries [here](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-2012-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1202).

4) If you miss the hard deadline for the mini-projects for whatever reason (or even if you don't), we will have a forum thread each week where you can get community feedback. You can see week one's thread [here](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-2012-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1179).

Keep up the lively discussion in the forums and keep on programming!

-Scott Rixner and Joe Warren
