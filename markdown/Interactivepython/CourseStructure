##Course Structure
To help understand the pacing of this course, we'd like to describe its weekly structure briefly.  Each week of class will consist of two sections. Each section covers some general topic related to interactive programming in Python and includes several videos and a quiz.  You should view all of the videos in each section before attempting the section's quiz.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of each week (Saturday morning), we will assign a mini-project that involves building a modest-sized Python program (50-150 lines).  This mini-project will be due on the following Saturday evening.  Completing these mini-projects will be the main challenge in this class. You and your classmates will then peer assess your mini-projects on the following Sunday-Wednesday.  Please note that you must peer-assess five of your classmates' mini-projects to receive a grade for your own mini-project.<br>
<br>
Here is an outline of a typical week's schedule.  (All times are Pacific Standard time in the U.S.)<br>
<ul><br>
<li> Saturday morning (4am PST) - release videos, quizzes and mini-project description for upcoming week.<br>
</li><li> Sunday morning (2am PST) - start peer assessment for previous week's mini-project.<br>
</li><li> Wednesday noon (10am PST) - finish peer assessment for previous week's mini-project.<br>
</li><li> Tuesday/Thursday evenings (10pm PST) - soft deadlines for first and second quizzes, respectively. (No penalty for submission after this deadline.)<br>
</li><li> Saturday evening - (10pm PST) hard deadlines for quizzes and current mini-project.<br></li></ul>
