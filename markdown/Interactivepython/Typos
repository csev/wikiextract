- Mini-project description - Spaceship

For this mini-project, you will implement a working spaceship plus add ***as***ingle asteroid  
While the right arrow is down, your spaceship should turn clockwise.  
your ship should maintain its orientation  
You will need to pick some reasonable angular velocity  
The thrusters should be on when the up arrow is down and off when it is up.  
Modify the draw method for the Ship class to draw the ship image (without thrust flames) instead of a circle.  
Modify the update method for the ship to increment its angle by its angular velocity.  
Add keydown and keyup handlers that check the left and right arrow keys.  
Add methods to the Ship class to increment and decrement the angular velocity  
and verify that you can turn your ship as you expect  
Add a method to the Ship class to turn the thrusters on/off  
which is True or False to decide if they should be on or off).  
play the thrust sound when the thrust is on.  
Adjust the constants as you would like to get it to fly how you want.
