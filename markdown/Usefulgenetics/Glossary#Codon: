###Activator gene:
A gene that codes for an activator protein. The activator protein enables the expression of a target gene - it turns the gene on.

###Allele:
A version or variant of a specific genetic sequence.

###Aneuploid:
A cell or organism with a chromosome number that is not a multiple of the normal haploid number. It has one or more extra or missing chromosomes.

###Carrier:
An individual who is heterozygous for a normal allele and a recessive (usually disease-causing) allele.

###Centromere:
The region of a chromosome that attaches to the fibres that pull daughter chromosomes away from each other during cell division.

###Chromosome:
A very long molecule of DNA arranged in a double helix and further coiled and complexed with proteins. The DNA carries an organism's genetic information.

###Codon:
A sequence of three bases in a DNA or RNA molecule. Each codon specifies an amino acid or the action "stop".

###Co-dominance:
Not really dominance. A situation where the phenotype of the heterozygote has features of the phenotypes of both homozygotes. A term best avoided.

###CRISPR:
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat. A DNA nucleotide replacement therapy.

###Diploid:
Possessing two genomes, i.e. two sets of chromosomes, two sets of DNA sequences.

###Epistasis:
The situation where phenotypic effects depend on the interactions between alleles of different loci.

###Exon:
A segment of bases within a gene that is copied from DNA to mRNA and remains in the mature mRNA after the splicing process so that its sequence is translated to make protein. See Intron.

###Gene:
An informational entity in DNA. Genes specify proteins or functional RNA.

###Gene family:
A set of genes ancestrally related by gene duplication.  As a result they are considered homologous and often have closely related sequence and function.

###Genetic code:
In eukaryotes, including humans, the set of 64 possible [[Usefulgenetics:Glossary#Codon: | Codons]].

###Genome:
In a human, one set of 24 chromosomes.

###Genotype:
The sequences of bases in an organism's DNA that make up its genes; its inherited instructions.

###Haploid:
Possessing only one genome, i.e. only one set of chromosomes, only one set of DNA sequences.

###Heritable:
Whether or not a phenotypic characteristic is at least in part determined by [[Usefulgenetics:Glossary#Genotype: | genotype]].

###Heritability:
The degree with which a phenotypic characteristic is determined by [[Usefulgenetics:Glossary#Genotype: | genotype]].

###Haplotype:
A contiguous DNA sequence inherited intact from an ancestor.

###Homology:
Similarity due to shared ancestry.

###Incomplete dominance:
Not really dominance. A situation where the heterozygote has a phenotype intermediate between the phenotypes of the two corresponding homozygotes. A term best avoided. 

###Incomplete penetrance:
Partial lack of expected phenotypic expression.

###Indel:
A genetic difference created by insertion or deletion of a base pair or of a longer DNA segment.

###Intron:
A segment of bases within a gene that is initially copied from DNA to mRNA but is then removed (spliced out) of the mRNA before the mRNA sequence is translated to make protein. See Exon.

###Locus:
The location of a gene or other DNA sequence on a chromosome. This includes any and all alleles of said gene.

###Mutation:
A permanent change in the sequence of nucleotide bases in DNA.

###Open reading frame:
A sequence of DNA bases starting with ATG and ending with the first in-frame stop codon. (TAA, TAG or TGA.)  The equivalent mRNA bases are AUG for the start codon and UAA, UAG and UGA for the stop codon.

###Phenotype:
The observable properties of an organism, including molecular properties detectable by blood tests etc.

###Pleitropy:
The situation where a gene affects more than one aspect of phenotype.

###Ploidy:
The number of homologous chromosome sets present in a cell or organism.

###Polymorphism:
The occurrence in a single population of at least two alleles with frequencies â‰¥ 1%.

###Polyploid:
A polyploid cell contains more than two full sets of chromosomes. There are naturally occurring polyploid plants and animals and also polyploid crops produced by plant breeding. Our normal bread wheat is hexaploid (6 sets of chromosomes).

###Promoter:
A region of DNA where RNA polymerase binds in order to start transcription.

###Rare variant:
A genetic difference present in < 1% of the population. (Copied from lecture 1G)

###Replication of DNA:
The strands of DNA separate and each strand acts as a template to make a new complementary strand of DNA. As a result, each DNA molecule is copied to produce two DNA molecules.

###Repressor gene:
A gene that codes for a repressor protein. The repressor protein prevents the expression of a target gene - it turns the gene off.

###RNA:  
A polymer of ribonucleotide subunits, with the 3' and 5' carbons of the ribose sugars joined by phosphate diesters.

###RNA polymerase:
An enzyme that creates RNA polymers from ribonucleotide triphosphate subunits, using a DNA or RNA strand as a template.

###Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP):
An SNV present in more than 1% of the population.

###Single-nucleotide variant (SNV): 
The presence of different nucleotides at homologous positions in two DNA sequences.

###STAP cells:
Pluripotent stem cells created by a patient's own mature cells.

###Start codon:
The position where the ribosome binds to the messenger RNA and starts translating the codons to assemble the right amino acids into a protein.

###Stop codon:
The position where the ribosome stops translating the codons on the messenger RNA, and therefore stops making a protein.

###Telomere:
The end region of a chromosome.

###Terminator:
A region of DNA that has a stop signal telling RNA polymerase to stop transcription and detach itself from the DNA sequence so that the RNA (which has been generated in transcription) can be released.

###Tetraploid:
A tetraploid cell contains four full sets of chromosomes. Some commercially grown plants are tetraploids and they are usually fertile when crossed among themselves.

###Transcription:
The conversion of DNA information into RNA information.

###Translation:
The process where the ribosome uses the sequence of bases in mRNA to determine the order of amino acids that it assembles into a protein.

###Triploid:
A triploid cell contains three full sets of chromosomes. Triploidy is fatal in humans. Triploid plants may grow well but are usually infertile. This feature is used to produce seedless fruit in some crops, for example watermelons and bananas.

###Variable expressivity:
The degree to which a particular phenotype is expressed in different individuals.
