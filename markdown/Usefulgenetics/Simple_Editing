#What is Markdown? 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)". The language takes many cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in email. Source: http://daringfireball.net

The following is taken from http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax. Refer to the link for a detailed guide on markdown.

##Headers

To make headers for markdown, you can use hash tags to denote how big you want the header to be. We use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:

\# This is an H1

\## This is an H2

\###### This is an H6

produces

# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6


##Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

###Unordered lists 

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens — interchangably — as list markers. For instance, this is how you use asterisks.

\*   Red

\*   Green

\*   Blue

produces

*   Red

*   Green

*   Blue

###Ordered lists 

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods.  Just type:

1.  Bird

2.  McHale

3.  Parish

##Links

###Links to pages within the Useful Genetics Wiki

Type \[[Usefulgenetics:name-of-page]]

For example, typing \[[Usefulgenetics:Main]] creates a link to our wiki home page: [[Usefulgenetics:Main]]

And typing \[[Usefulgenetics:Main | Useful Genetics Wiki Home]] creates the same link with only the page name showing: [[Usefulgenetics:Main | Useful Genetics Wiki Home]]

To link to a glossary entry (useful to cross reference entries) use for example:-

\[[Usefulgenetics:Glossary#Haplotype: | Haplotype]]

Which reders as:-

[[Usefulgenetics:Glossary#Haplotype: | Haplotype]]

###Links to external pages

Simple links to external pages are created just by typing the url:

    http://joshreads.com/

If you want to show the page's title instead of the url, put the page title in square brackets before the url in round brackets:

    \[Comics Curmudgeon](http://joshreads.com/) displays as [Comics Curmudgeon](http://joshreads.com/)

##New Pages

 To create a new page just create a link to it, as if it existed.  When you save the page you're on, it will have a link to the empty new page, and clicking on that link will take you to your new page's Edit page.
