Useful Genetics:  Module 6

[[Usefulgenetics:Main | Back to Useful Genetics Wiki home page]]
Since I did not see a 'Miscellaneous' or 'General comments' choice listed, I decided to comment here in the opening Module 6 section. :)

In the opening survey, my choice(s) were not available/listed, i.e. I 'may' do some quizzes and assignments, dependent on my schedule and priorities, etc., :).  I prefer quiz only courses, and I also have a preference for actual biology/biochemistry lab work (though I find theories/concepts interesting as well, of course). :)  In any case, I always watch the videos of all courses I audit.  I occasionally comment if I have useful info to add to a discussion.  I may do one quiz of this course out of curiosity, and to fulfil my check of the choice of 'less than half'.  I am not concerned about 'marks' at all.  In any case, thanks for offering the course. I've always found genetics to be a fascinating subject, and I wish more priority was given to the urgent task of getting DNA samples from endangered/unknown species of flora and fauna, virii, bacteria, etc., before they disappear, as well as people who are the last speakers of disappearing languages/cultures, etc.  Sigh. :)  Hope everyone appreciates and enjoys the course.  Good luck! :)
