Useful Genetics:  Module 1
 
##Concepts and explanations

This is the section for explanations of particular concepts.  Users are encouraged to edit and improve explanations provided by other students.

###Example:  SNPs and SNVs
A SNV is a single-nucleotide variant, a SNP is a single-nucleotide polymorphism.  Both are places in the genome where the sequences of some people differ at a single position. Only some variants are polymorphisms - the term refers to variants that are found in at least 1% of genomes.

###Asexual reproduction vs. Sexual reproduction
Asexual reproduction keeps the same ploidy, the same set of chromosomes, and produces clonal cells identical to the parent cells. Sexual reproduction, on the other hand, produces haploid gametes and then diploid cells, each one of which has a different combination of the alleles that were present in the parents and the grandparents.

###Homology
Homology is similarity due to shared ancestry. If similarities in genes are, A) too strong to have arisen by chance and, B) too arbitrary (i.e. unrelated to function) to have arisen by convergent evolution, we infer that they must exist due to divergence from a common ancestor. Because DNA has only four unique bases, we expect around 25% similarity between DNA sequences to occur by chance. If, therefore, the similarity between sequences is 25% or less, there is probably no homology between said sequences. If, however, we can find an alignment of DNA sequences where the similarities amount to more than 25%, we can usually infer that the sequences are homologous. Once we have determined that DNA or protein sequences are homologous, their degree of similarity tells us how recent their common ancestor was. Note: When comparing two DNA sequences, their homologous positions must be aligned.

###Transcription
In transcription, RNA polymerase binds to a start signal (the promoter) in the DNA sequence. It then travels along the sequence, transcribing DNA information into RNA information. When it reaches a stop signal (the terminator), it stops transcribing and detaches itself from the DNA sequence. It then releases the RNA that has been generated.

###Translation
In translation, protein polymerase (i.e. the ribosome) binds to a start codon in the RNA sequence. It then travels along the sequence, translating RNA information into protein information (i.e. a sequence of amino acids from which specific proteins are synthesized). When it reaches a stop codon, it stops translating and detaches itself from the RNA sequence. It then releases the amino acid sequence that has been generated so that it can be used to guide protein synthesis.
