# Known Assignment and Quiz Grader Numerical Errors:

## Quiz 2

* Q11 — assume t=0 as starting point for iteration (not stated in the problem)
* Q12 — assume t=0 as starting point for iteration (not stated in the problem)

## Quiz 3

* Q4 — assume c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 (not stated in the problem) 
* Q5 — assume c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 (not stated in the problem)  
* Q6 — + 0.1 to the correctly rounded answer for no apparent reason.

## Quiz 6
    
* Q3 — assume the range is [0,1] not [-1,1] as in the description.

## Quiz 8

* Q3 — assume $$\delta^2=1$$.


## Quiz 10

All iterations start at 1, example 1-9 == 8 iterations

## Quiz 11

* Q3 — correct operation count for FFT would use log base 2 since you split the problem
into a binary tree with FFT, grader expects natural log (also rounded down instead of up??!), 
I believe because matlab uses natural log by default but this is an error.
(Technically, O() ignores constant factors, and there are plenty of factors in the FFT operation count. The unit operation has a complex multiply, complex add, and complex subtract. Does that count as ten or one or some other number?)

* Q4 — correct answer requires $$f\prime(x)$$ = (-i*k)^n*f(x) not (i*k)^n*f(x) like in the lectures.

## Homework 2

* B — do not actually use the same shooting method for Beta, it does not pass the grader.      
hard code eps_n =1
* BQA — solution correct with either method
* BQB — off +/- ??
* BQC — solution correct with either method
* BQD — off +/- ??

## Homework 4

Equation 4 of faqHW4.pdf should be $$\omega_t = \nu A\omega - B\psi C\omega +C\psi B\omega$$, i.e. the Laplacian matrix $$A$$ is applied to $$\omega$$ not $$\psi$$.
