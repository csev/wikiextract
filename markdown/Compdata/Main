# Tools, Editors, IDEs

Links to tools, editor extensions and IDEs that are mentioned in the user forums.

### RStudio

RStudio is a free and open source integrated development environment for R.

http://www.rstudio.com/ide/


### ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)

Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) is an add-on package for Emacs text editors. It is designed to support editing of scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis programs such as R, S-Plus, SAS, Stata and JAGS.

http://www.openanalytics.eu/architect


### r4intellij - R plugin for the IntelliJ IDE

r4intellij is an R plugin fro the IntelliJ IDE, the plugin allows for syntax highlighting, intelligent code folding and completion, refactorings, and more. 

https://code.google.com/p/r4intellij/


### Rattle - A Graphical User Interface for Data Mining using R 

Rattle (the R Analytical Tool To Learn Easily) presents statistical and visual summaries of data, transforms data into forms that can be readily modelled, builds both unsupervised and supervised models from the data, presents the performance of models graphically, and scores new datasets. 

It is open source and available for Linux, Windows and MacOS.

http://rattle.togaware.com/


### Revolution R Community

Revolution R Community is Revolution Analytics' free distribution of the open source R programming language -- enhanced for users looking for faster performance and greater stability. It's perfect for learning R and basic analysis.

### RKWard

is an easy to use and easily extensible IDE/GUI for R. It aims to combine the power of the R-language with the ease of use of commercial statistics tools. 

- [http://rkward.sourceforge.net/ RKWard]



### R Unit Testing frameworks

A list of known testing tools for R. Such tools are useful when developing and supporting large R projects.

 - [RUnit](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RUnit/index.html) is based on xunit so will be familiar to programmers who have used xunit based testing frameworks for other languages e.g. Junit, Nunit, etc.
   
 - [Svunit](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/svUnit/index.html) uses same test syntax as RUnit but includes a GUI.
    
 - [Testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.htm) not compatible with the two above, but does have a possible useful feature that it can be made to only run tests on files that have not changed.

### StatET for R - R plugin for Eclipse

StatET is an R plugin for the Eclipse development environment.  It offers a set of mature tools for R coding and package building. This includes a fully integrated R Console, Object Browser and R Help System, whereas multiple local and remote installations of R are supported.

StatET is provided as plug-in for the Eclipse IDE. Therefore the user can combine it with a wide range set of tools working on top of the Eclipse Platform. Like R and Eclipse, StatET is open source software, and works on many operating systems.

### Tinn-R

Tinn-R is free, simple but efficient replacement for the basic code editor provided by Rgui. Only available for Windows

- http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/


### Vim-R-plugin

This plugin improves Vim's support for editing R code and makes it possible to integrate Vim with R. The functionality is similar to what you can find in Tinn-R and ESS mode of Emacs.
