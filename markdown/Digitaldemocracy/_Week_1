## Voting as a Security Problem

voting is fundamental for democracy; electoral fraud is as old as voting

#### Goals for the course
* Understand how votes are counted
* Apply the security mindset
* Critically examine the role of technology
* Learn what we can do to make elections more fair and accurate

#### Security Mindset
* Look for ways that things can go wrong
* Adversary = criminal, bad guy
* Adversarial failures = adversary successfully sabatoging something

**Think like an attacker**
:::* Understand how to circumvent security
:::* How can the system break?
:::* What is the weakest link? easist to attack?
:::* Identify false assumptions
:::* Think outside the box of system designer

**Think like a defender**  
:::* security policy 
::::* What is being protected?
::::* What properties are being enforced?


**Threat model**
:::* Who are the attackers? capabilities? motives?
:::* What kind of attack?


**Risk assessment**
:::* Weaknesses of the system?
:::* Costs of a successful attack?
:::* How likely?


**Countermeasures**
* Costs vs. benefits
* Technical vs. nontechnical
	
#### Ssecurity requirements for voting
**1. Integrity**
* Outcome is the same as voter intent
* Votes are cast as intended
* Votes are counted as cast

**2. Ballot secrecy**
* Weak: no one can figure out how a person voted
* Strong: no one can reveal how he/she voted → prevent vote buying, coercion

**3. Voter authentication**
* Only authorized voters vote
* Each voter can only vote once

**4. Voter enfranchisement**
* All authorized voters have the opportunity to vote

**5. Availability**
* Election system is able to accept all votes and produce results in a timely manner

**Other concerns**
* cost effectiveness
* availability
* convenience
* intelligibility

**Noteworthy for decision-making:**
*Tensions exist between some security requirements such as between Integrity and Ballot Secrecy, Voter authentication and enfranchisement.*
*These tensions require trade-offs which ultimately result in what security/technology to embark on to protect ballots.*
*It is believed these trade-offs are the underlying considerations for whatever technologies have been used at different times in voting history.*

## How We Got Here

#### The Living Voice

Voice Voting:  
*viva voce* = living voice in Latin
	
**Process:**  
* Voter walks up to polling place  
* Election judge swears in voter on the Bible   
* Voter calls out his name loudly → authorization  
* Voter calls out candidate he is voting for  
* Clerks write down voters name and vote  
* Observers could also record votes as they are called out  
	
**Problems:**  
* No ballot secrecy   
* Candidate could be within listening distance of vote  
* Voter intimidation/coercion possible  
* Vote buying possible  

#### Early Paper Ballots
Replaced voice voting  
France & England wrote ballot voting into constitution and charters  
Earliest known use in ancient Greece (used balls, tokens)  
Ballot boxes were usually locked  
Voters put paper ballot in slot on box  
Officials counted votes publicly; if counting later, might seal the box  
	
**Security Mechanisms during counting:**
Reader of ballot does not have a writing implement  
Observers from different parties, levels of government
	
**Security Issues:**
* Procedural: if not followed precisely could exclude the observers in the back
* Readers could announce any name
* Ballot boxes could be rigged – false botton and false side
* Glass boxes were introduced to prevent this
* Faulty lock

Acme voting machine
	1st machine – had gears, crank
	Voter inserted ballot, turned crank → bell to signal vote entered, counter protected against box stuffing, same # of ballots as votes
	

Cardboard ballot box:
	disposable


Metal ballot box:
	more secure than cardboard
	metal tab for attaching padlocks
		

**Design of Ballots:**
* Early ballots → voter wrote in names
* Would be easier for voters to have names already on ballots
* Some had one name printed & room for other names to be written in
* Possible for voters to write in the spaces between listed names
* Party tickets
* Nonstandard designs → voter confusion


**Security Issues:**  
Multiple voting  
* Multiple ballots printed on same ticket  
* Voter responsible for tearing them off  
* Different colors used for different party tickets  
* Weak protections  

#### The Australian Ballot  

* Pre-printed ballot → uniformity
* Provided by the government, not the voter or parties
* Voting booth → secrecy
* Voter registration  
   
* Additional costs
:** Had to decide in advance who goes on the ballot   
:** Printing ballots
:** More advanced preparation  
:** Storage of booths between elections  
:** Additional complexity: advanced planning, printing  


**Security Issues:**  
* Counting bosses and political corruption: Boss Tweed & Tamany Hall
* Counters made extra marks on ballots with hidden pencil/lead (short pencil artist)
* Marks could also be erased
* Extraneous marks would disqualify a vote (identifying marks/names/multiple votes)	


**Chain Voting:**  
* Person waits outside polling place and says he wants to buy ballots
* Has a pre-filled out ballot
* Voter takes the ballot to the voting booth
* Voter picks a new ballot & goes to booth with it
* Puts pre-filled out ballot in box & gives blank ballot to criminal
* Criminal uses blank ballot with another person
*Could prevent using a detachable serial number on ballot to make sure voter returns the same ballot
		


#### Mechanical Voting Machines  
* Industrial Revolution influenced invention of mechanical voting machines – late 1800s-early 1900s
* Claims: complete secrecy, tamper proof
* Mechanism to prevent multiple voting
* Inside machine, locked: counter mechanism to count votes as they were cast
* Could vote for individual candidates or a party
* Lever to close & open the curtain; lever would cast the votes and clear the board
* Was in view of an official to ensure correct procedure done
* Eliminated most of the problems of voice voting, paper ballots, chain voting, etc
* Security issues:  
::** No record that voter voted; nothing for voter to see
::** Mechanical failure due to multiple parts, gears, etc
::** Counter could stop incrementing if tab broke off
::** Sabotage to machine → difficult to distinguish if mechanical or sabatoge
::** Fraud: jam pencil lead into gears  

#### Punched Card Voting:  
* Holes punched out of a card with a stylus and read by a computer
* Nothing printed on cards → secrecy
* Security issues:
::** No good way for the voter to see the vote being counted correctly
::** Easy to misalign cards
::** Florida 2000 presidential election: some voters voted for 2 candidates
::** Votes were discounted
::** Chad (paper punched out): can cause many problems
::** Can block another hole being punched
::** Holes might not be punched all the way
::** Could be maliciously tampered with during counting
::** Punch cards are no longer used → computer voting systems introduced
