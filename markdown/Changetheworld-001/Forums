#### Why these Wiki pages are created?
* [https://class.coursera.org/changetheworld-001/forum/thread?thread_id=126 Course Glossary] -
  This is the thread about the Course Glossary.
  Not the Course Glossary itself.

* [https://class.coursera.org/changetheworld-001/forum/thread?thread_id=246 Two suggestions to support the course and promote social change]
1. Open up Wiki pages for us. Therefore we're here.
2. Create Master Discussion Thread for collaborating "projects".
  - My take is that it's hard to navigate within the current state of our forums.
    We need a place to groups these discussion threads.
    This Wiki seems to be the only logical place.

* [https://class.coursera.org/changetheworld-001/forum/thread?thread_id=580 Please use this "new" wiki page to post your issues of concern]
* [https://class.coursera.org/changetheworld-001/forum/thread?thread_id=590 Can the discussion boards be divided to match the weekly topics?] -
  Not going to happen.
  But this Wiki alleviate the organizational problem some what.
