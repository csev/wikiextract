[[Category:How to change the world]]

## Getting Started
Wiki is for viewing.
But if you want to change the page that you're viewing, you can.

There is an "Edit" tab near the top right on your page.
Click on it and you'll be in Edit mode.
When you're in Edit mode, you'll see a box that have texts on it.
I'll call it the Edit Window.
It is empty if you've started a new page.
You can type your text in it so that they'll show up later in your page.

There are some rules that some special sequence of characters will affect the formatting of the final display.
I'll explain them to you in the following sections.
But before that, you have to know how to '''exit''' from the Edit mode.

In Edit mode, you'll see there are 3 buttons near the end of your page.
There are also the words ''Cancel'' and ''Editing help'' on the same line.
The 3 buttons are '''Save Page''', '''Show preview''', and '''Show changes'''.
You only need to know only the followings to get by:
* '''Cancel''' is to forget all your changes, exit Edit mode and go back to viewing your page.
* '''Show preview''' shows you how the effect of your editing will look like without saving it yet.
* '''Save page''' is to commit your change made in your Edit window. Make sure you preview your change before saving.

## Learn the basics in 20 minutes

### How to make a paragraph
Paragraphs are separated by '''empty lines'''.
If what you type are not separate by empty lines,
they are grouped together into a paragraph.
So just put you sentences as normal
and put in a empty line when you want to separate them into paragraphs.

Test out how to make a paragraph '''[[Changetheworld-001:WikiHelp:Paragraph | here]]'''.
(Click on the preceding word "here" to start testing.)

### How to make a list
You just put an asterisk ('''*'''), a plus sign ('''+'''), or a hyphen ('''-''') at the beginning of a line.
Then you have one item of the list.
I usually use asterisk.
But it's your choice.
Put a few lines starting with asterisks together.
You get a list.

### How to put in a Heading
Heading starts with one or more hash sign ('''#''') at the beginning of the line.
The top level Heading starts with one hash sign.
The second level Heading starts with two hash signs and so on.

Headings with different levels affect how the whole Wiki page displays.
Make sure you put in the correct number of hashes on the Heading lines.

### How to put in a web-link
Web-link is the string starts with '''http://''' or '''https://''' that refers to a webpage.
We call that string '''URL'''.

In Edit mode, you put the link inside square brackets i.e. '''[''your link here'']''' anywhere inside your text.
It can be part of a sentences.
It can be inside an item of a list.
After you exit Edit mode,
when people click on the web-link, their browsers will bring them to that webpage.

In the Edit Window, the link can have 2 components.
A URL follows by a string to identify it.

Test out how to make a web-link '''[[Changetheworld-001:WikiHelp:Link | here]]'''.


### How to start a new Wiki page
You make a special web-link, using the syntax
'''\[\[Changetheworld-001:''your new page''\]\]'''.
After you save the change or look at your page in preview,
you'll see that link colored red.
If you see the link is blue of some other color,
the link already exits and you have choose another name.

When you click on the new link, you'll be dropped into Edit mode to start editing the new page.

'''Caution''': 
We have to follow some naming convention when creating Wiki pages.
See how other Wiki pages are named and follows the same convention.

## To learn more
Remember at in the ''Getting Started'' section above
I mentioned '''Editing help''' that is on the same row as ''Save page'' near the bottom of your page.
You can find more help there.

But the easiest way to learn is to go to any page in this Wiki,
enter Edit mode and '''see how other people edit''' the page.
Copy their techniques.
Don't worry too much if your formatting is not perfect.
As long as you put your stuff there and don't delete other people's content,
somebody can fix the formatting for you when they see it.
Use the preview button to see what you've changed before saving it.
