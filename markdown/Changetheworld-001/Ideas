[[Category:How to change the world]]

#Topics

I'd suggest you start a new "Heading" inside each of the following Wiki pages to list your issues of concern.
I also suggest you organize the pages just like what are found in Wikipedia.

You should open a new page for each subtopic and list the different possible solutions and pros and cons there.
Don't forget to put links to references and websites there too.
