## Demo Using Excel
* How to download historical data from Yahoo
* How to manipulate it in Excel
* How to compute the metrics weâ€™ve been talking about

# Notes
## Download historical data
There are lots of good sources of financial data online. Both Yahoo Finance [http://finance.yahoo.com/] and Google Finance [https://www.google.com/finance] provide historical prices.
* For example, Apple on [Yahoo](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL&ql=0 "Apple on Yahoo") and [Google](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AAAPL&ei=eFeKUNjoGYeHwAORXg "Apple on Google")
* Historic data can be saved as csv eg. [Yahoo - Apple 2011 csv](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=AAPL&a=00&b=1&c=2011&d=11&e=31&f=2011&g=d "Apple 2011 csv") and [Google - Apple 2011 csv](https://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=22144&startdate=Jan+1%2C+2011&enddate=dec+31%2C+2011&num=30&ei=KFmKUJiGJYeHwAORXg "Google - Apple 2011 csv")
* This data can be imported into excel or other spreadsheet programs
** The data includes date, open, high, low, close, volume, and adjusted close.
** The data we will work with is adjusted close. Adjusted close is different from close.


## How to manipulate it in Excel
How to calculate values using real data in a spread sheet.

* Sort data by date ascending (oldest first)
* Delete open, high, low, close, and volume, leaving date and adjusted close.
* Calculate Total Return (Annual Return)
** (Final Value/First Value)-1, for example =(D253/D2)-1
* Calculate Daily Return
** (Today's value/Yesterday's Value)-1, for example =(B3/B2)-1
** Format as percentage.
* Calculate Average Daily Return.
** Average of all Daily Returns, for example =average(C2:C253)
** Format as number.
* Calculate Standard Deviation of Daily Return.
** Standard Deviation over all Daily Returns, for example =stdev(C2:C253)
** Format as number
* Calculate Sharpe Ratio
** Square Root of 253 multiplied by (Average Daily Return divided by Standard Deviation of Daily Returns), for example =sqrt(253)*F4/F5
