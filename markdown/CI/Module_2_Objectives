# Notes
## Viewpoint
* I assume you want to be a portfolio manager.

## Portfolio Manager / Hedge Fund Incentives
* Expense ratio
** Used by mutual funds & ETFs.
** Usually less than 1%.
* “Two and twenty”
** Classic structure for hedge funds.
** $1M with 20% / year = $60K/year.
* How/why different?

## How to Attract Investors?
Know your audience:
* Individuals
* Institutions:
** Harvard Foundation
** CalPERS
* Funds of Funds
* Must have track record, or
* Very compelling story and back test.
* Fit in a “pigeon hole?”
* What do investors want to see?

## Two Main Types of Fund Goals
* Reference to a benchmark (pigeon hole).
* Absolute return.

## Example: Compare with Benchmark

## What are Investors Looking For?

## Common Metrics
* Annual return.
* Risk: Standard deviation of return.
* Risk: Draw down.
* Reward/Risk: Sharpe Ratio.
* Reward/Risk: Sortino Ratio.
* Jensen’s Alpha.

## Example
<pre>
      Return  Sharpe   STDEV   D-down   Corr
Fund     33%     .94   0.58%   -8.67%   0.89
$DJI     43%     .63   1.23%  -27.38%   1.00
</pre>

## Annual Return
* metric = (value[end]/value[start]) – 1
* Example: $100 to $110:
** (110/100) – 1 = 0.10 = 10%

## Standard Deviation of Daily Return
* daily_rets[i] = (value[i]/value[i-1]) – 1
* std_metric = stdev(daily_rets)

## Max Draw Down

## Sharpe Ratio
$$S =  \frac{E [R - R_f]}{\sigma} = \frac{E [R - R_f]}{\sqrt{var[R - R_f]}}$$  
* metric = (average(daily_rets)/stdev(daily_rets)) * sqrt(250)
