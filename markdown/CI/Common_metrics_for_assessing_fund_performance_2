# Objectives
* Sharpe Ratio.

	 	
# Notes
## How To Compare Similar Portfolios?
* daily_rets[i] = (value[i]/value[i-1]) – 1
* std_metric = stdev(daily_rets)



## Sharpe Ratio	
* Most “important” measure of asset performance.
* How well does the return of an asset compensate the investor for the risk taken?
* The higher the Sharpe ratio the better. 
* When comparing two assets each with the same return, higher Sharpe ratio gives more return for the same risk.

$$S =  \frac{E [R - R_f]}{\sigma} = \frac{E [R - R_f]}{\sqrt{var[R - R_f]}}$$  

* Reward/Risk = How much reward are you getting for your risk?
* metric = k * mean(daily_rets)/stdev(daily_rets))
* k = sqrt(250) for daily returns

## Example
<pre>
      Return  Sharpe   STDEV   D-down   Corr
Fund     33%     .94   0.58%   -8.67%   0.89
$DJI     43%     .63   1.23%  -27.38%   1.00
