Scott Aaronson was actually Prof. Umesh Vazirani's PhD student and is now a famous professor at MIT.  

Here is another good post he did on Shor's algorithm which should come up later on in the course:

One place to start is to scroll down to the QM section and then try the 1-D Quantum Mechanics Applet  
'Single-particle quantum mechanics states in one dimension.'
