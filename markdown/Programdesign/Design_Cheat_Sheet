The Design Cheat Sheet lays out each step you take when using the How to Design Programs recipe. If you have only learned [HtDF](https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/view?page=HtDFunctions) or [HtDD](https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/view?page=HtDData) you may be better off visiting their respective pages. 

## HtDW

1. Domain analysis (use a piece of paper!)
 1. Sketch program scenarios
 2. Identify constant information
 3. Identify changing information
 4. Identify big-bang options
2. Build the actual program
 1. Constants (based on 1.2 above)
 2. [[Data definition]] (based on 1.3 above)
 3. Functions
   *. main first (based on 1.3, 1.4 and 2.2 above)
   *. wish list entries for [[big-bang]] handlers
 4. Work through wish list until done


## HtDD

1. A possible [[structure definition]].
2. A [[type comment]] that defines a new type name and describes how to form data of that type.
3. An interpretation that describes the correspondence between information and data.
4. One or more examples of the data.
5. A [[template]] for a 1 argument function operating on data of this type.


## HtDF

1. [[Signature]], [[purpose]] and [[stub]].
2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect.
3. Template and inventory.
4. Code the function body.
5. Test and debug until correct
