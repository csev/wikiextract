The Coursera Wiki is a web site.  It can be used just like a web site.

It is also a location for collaborative work by students and staff.  Any student who is in a class can contribute pages, edit and correct material, and support the organization of an useful collection of material for themselves and fellow students.

Here are some details on getting around in the Wiki.  Further material will link to ways to learn how to work on the wiki and collaborate with others working on the wiki.

Using the Course Wiki
=====================

To access the Course Wiki, you must log in.  If you are here, you've done that already.

On subsequent visits, you will be asked to log in again.  If you are returning using the same browser and computer of an earlier visit, the log in link will log you in automatically.  If too much time has passed or something else has changed, you will be asked for your credentials -- e-mail address and password -- again.

Finding the Wiki, Finding Your Place
------------------------------------

The easiest way to come to the wiki is via the link on the sidebar of course pages.

This is also an useful place to start over if you find yourself lost in some unexpected corner of the wiki.

Each course has its own Wiki Main Page.  All of the pages of a single course have a course-identifying prefix (usually).  Here, Programdesign:Main is the Main Page for Systematic Program Design \[1?\].  The course-specific prefix is "Programdesign".  You can always see what page you are at by its full prefixed name at the top.

It is useful to bookmark the course Main page if you'll be coming to the Course Wiki regularly.

The Main page link on the sidebar of wiki pages is *not* for the Course Main page.  That is for the Main page of the entire Coursera Wiki, not just an individual course.  That's one way to be lost.

Another way to be lost is by using Search.  The Search entry at the top of all of the pages will search the entire Coursera Wiki.  That can be interesting.  When you're not certain where you've landed, you can always come back into the Course Wiki at the *course's* Main page.
