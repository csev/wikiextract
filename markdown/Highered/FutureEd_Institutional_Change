##Instructions
This wiki is for institutional change, including ideas and road maps for leading change and scaling innovation across a learning or educational institution.  (NB: Please contribute to the "[pedagogical innovations](https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/HigherEd:FutureEd_Pedagogical_Innovations)" wiki for innovations explicitly designed for teaching and learning and intended for the classroom.  This is designed to model  changed educational, disciplinary, departmental, other institutional structures and paradigms, small and large. MOOCs are one example.  What are other models?)

Please use the format below.  We recommend that you copy the format template, add it to the list, and fill in your content.

Title:      Professional Society of Academics

Source or location: Shawn Warren PhD

Short Description (inc comment on what kind of change is addressed): This is an original, comprehensive, alternative, entrepreneurial model for the provision of higher education (HE).  There are in fact two such models - a professional and a co-operative - that when combined stand to move HE from the capitalist to the social economy.  Focusing here only on the professional model, this alternative to the current institutional model (university/college service providers; government funding; and union labour representation) specifies that academics offer their expertise as attorneys, dentists, physicians or accountants do, under the protection and direction of a formal professional social contract - not as the union represented employees of universities and colleges.  The result is systemic change that stands to benefit all interested parties in HE - institutions, academics, students and the public.  One important benefit is that for face-to-face education with low teacher/student ratios the professional model is as much as 75% cheaper to run than the institutional model.  A second benefit is that many more academics can be put into service since they are no longer subject to the bottle-neck of institutional employment.  These benefit stand to increase access to quality HE provided by labour that is not exploited.  These and other important, significant benefits recommend the professional over the traditional institutional model.

Sample Project: As far as I know there are none.  At the moment the model is new theory.

##Institutional Change

Title:  ASAP (Accelerated Study in Associate Programs)

Source or location:  Borough of Manhattan Community College; story, Atlantic: [http://m.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/01/how-to-escape-the-community-college-trap/355745/](http://m.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/01/how-to-escape-the-community-college-trap/355745/) by Ann Hulbert, "How To Escape the Community College Trap"

Short Description: Begun in 2007 under Mayor Bloomberg's Center for Economic Opportunity, the ASAP progrma deserves consideration now as an institutional innovation because it runs exactly counter to the logic of MOOCs and most other self-designed programs for lower income students.  Research shows that successful completion of online courses (MOOCs and otherwise) requires exceptional motivation and often enculturation into the norms of self-paced learning.   ASAP goes the opposite direction and is based on the research that success depends on structured, clear, demanding programing, constant advisory supervision by mentors, peers, and teachers, exceptional guidance, and clear rewards for success (Metro Cards, loans forgiven, and other clear financial outcomes for academic success). 

Sample project:   "Take Harvard, where the rising elite chart their paths within well-designed parameters: the college offers a bachelor’s degree in 48 academic fields only to full-time, residential students, who must also fulfill carefully articulated general-education requirements. Their first-year experience unfolds under the supervision of an entire team. . . Compare that with nearby Bunker Hill Community College, as Judith Scott-Clayton, a professor at Columbia University, has done. ...As to plotting a course of study and then staying on it, community-college students are largely on their own."--quoted from Atlantic article.

Title:        Bass Connections  

Source or location:  Duke University 

Short Description: Bass Connections is a new university-wide initiative that re-envisions the typically scattered and disconnected version of general education by offering students interrelated theoretical and problem-based pathways through the curriculum.  It begins with a topical team-taught introductory overview course required in the first year, then proposes related courses for remaining distribution requirements, and culminates in students working in research teams of undergraduate, graduate students, and faculty dedicated to complex challenges.  Bass Connections is by design interdisciplinary and extends, amplifies, and deepens more field-specific discipline-based majors.

Sample Projects: Topical areas include Brain and Society; Information, Society and Culture; Global Health; Education and Human Development; and Energy.

Title: British Columbia Education  Plan 2014, K-12      

Source or location: British Columbia, Canada

Short Description:  British Columbia’s education system is among the world’s best. B.C. students are learning well at school and scoring well on international exams.  So it is fitting that leaders of this excellent educational system should also be leading the world in a new plan to make it more innovative, modernizing it so it becomes flexible and more responsive to students’ and families’ needs. One of the keys is to personalize learning by putting students at the centre of learning so they can follow their own interests and passions within the topic matter.  It provides additional support to teachers, involves family, and, as a next phase, plans to find alternatives to high-stakes, summative, end-of-year testing in favor of real-time feedback or formative challenges and testing.

Title:   Liberal Arts Network for Development (LAND) 

Source or location: Michigan Community Colleges

Short Description:  In addition to other missions, LAND has added a forward-looking digital literacy component and competition for community college students in Michigan.  LAND seeks to develop and to promote a network for strengthening the liberal arts in Michigan community colleges. Mission LAND's mission is to (1) Explore the values and relevance of the liberal arts to our colleges and communities, (2) Unify and integrate the liberal arts with our curricula as appropriate, (3) Identify and work toward improving liberal arts instruction, (4) Plan for the immediate, short-term, and future needs of liberal arts education and instruction, and (5) Meet on a regular basis to work toward achieving the above objectives

Sample Project:  LAND Conference and LAND Digital Literacy Prize: [http://www.landconference.org/digital/index.html](http://www.landconference.org/digital/index.html%C2%A0%C2%A0)   New competition designed to inspire digital literacy

Title:   PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge  

Source or location: Duke University

Short Description: To prepare doctoral students for future teaching and research where digital fluency, online publishing, and collaborative methodologies are increasingly important, the PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge at the [Franklin Humanities Institute](http://fhi.duke.edu/) at Duke provides an arena in which PhD students in humanities and interpretive social sciences and MFA students in Experimental Documentary Media and Arts can learn together.   The emphasis is on ways to use new digital scholarship, engage with its challenges, and see its promise for their own research and professional lives within or outside the university. In the PhD Lab, we seek to balance the practical and the conceptual by allowing participants to prototype projects and receive peer feedback to enrich their understanding of the potential of digital scholarship. 

Sample Projects:  Each PhDLab Scholar builds a professional website for his/her own cv, syllabi, open source articles, blog posts, related interests.   Other graduate student-designed projects:  SoundLab, Ecology of Networks
