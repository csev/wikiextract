#3200 BCE
Earliest known use of writing (other than for counting), Mesopotamia (Sumer)

Notes regarding writing:

For thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution human social networks remained relatively small and simple. The first that managed to overcome this problem, were the ancient Sumerians, who lived in Southern Mesopotamia, what is today Southern Iraq. Large towns and even kingdoms began to grow around the year 4000 BC there. 

Sometime between 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some unknown Sumerian geniuses invented a new system for storing and processing information outside the brain. This new system was custom-built to handle large amounts of numbers of mathematical data. In this way the Sumerian’s released their social order from the limitations of the human brain 
and opened the way for the appearance of larger societies. 

This data processing system that the Sumerian’s invented is of course writing. Writing is a method for storing and processing information by using material signs rather than neurons. Writing wasn’t invented to write poetry or philosophy, or history, this could and was done without writing. (If we look for the first words of wisdom reaching us from our ancestors 5,000 years ago we are in for a disappointment. If you’re thinking that the first words of wisdom written by human kind is some kind of big philosophical idea or some kind of wonderful poem or story then think again).

The college's president disagreed and the riff between Dartmouth’s president and the Board of Trustees evolved into the landmark supreme course case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1811.  The famed Daniel Webster argued the case on behalf of Woodward purporting that it was unconstitutional to usurp the rights of a private institution and turn it into a public institution.  Daniel Webster won the case, resulting in laws that have protected the rights of private institutions of higher education for over 200 years.  Dartmouth College continues to operate today as a private college in New Hampshire. http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17/518
