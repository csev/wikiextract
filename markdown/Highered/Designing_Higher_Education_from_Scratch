#Designing Higher Education from Scratch: 
The students in Professor Davidson's face-to-face course (aka your community TAs) have created a first draft of some basic, preliminary ideas for their collaborative project on designing higher education from scratch. Please find below a "napkin sketch" for your comments and feedback from our "Designing Higher Education from Scratch" project, created by a project team in the Duke "History and Future of Higher Education" course.  For more information about this project, please see [this post](http://www.hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson/2013/11/23/what-if-we-could-build-higher-education-scratch-what-would-it-look). 

_**Note: You can also give feedback, post comments, provide suggestions and pose questions in the [Designing Higher Education from Scratch forum](https://class.coursera.org/highered-001/forum/list?forum_id=10151).**_

##[[Highered:OurCollege | Our College]]
_Motto: “Helping students engineer bridges toward our future…”_

**Background:**
In today’s world, landing a good job and a secure income often depends on graduating from a four year college. Unfortunately college completion rates for students from low-income families are significantly lower than their higher-income counterparts. While the reasons for this are complex, it is partially due to the fact that students from low-income families often do not have access to quality high school education and therefore are not equipped with the skills needed to thrive in college.

**Mission:** 
Our College is a small low-cost junior/community college aimed at equipping promising students with the skills they need to succeed in a rigorous higher education environment.  Our College targets the underserved population of low-income students [in the city where we are located] who enter college without the skills and support they need to succeed.

##[[Highered:HandHeadHeartUniversity | Hand, Head, Heart University]]
_Learning yourself to engage the world, engaging the world to learn yourself._

_Louis Nizer: “He who works with his hands is a laborer. He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman. He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.”_

**Decision Points/Assumptions:**

*Based on current university structure
*We should discover a purpose in life
*We should pursue those purposes to positively engage communities
*Every individual has a unique way of learning
*Every culture has unique priorities and ways of thinking about their world
*We are an increasingly globalized world. While that has its flaws, we strive to use the advantages afforded by critical and meaningful engagement for making positive growth
*Those who have gained access to education and social mobility should ‘pay it forward’
*The best ideas can come from the most unlikely sources, we should be in ongoing dialogue with a myriad of peoples

**University Principles:**
*To help students identify their interests and skills and apply them in real-world cases.
*To provide spaces for collaboration with people in communities within and outside of the university space.
*To provide students with the resources and networks necessary to pursue a project of their own design
*To provide a system within which students can grow to become seers, doers, teachers, and sharers of their individual passions and intellectual interests.
*To provide holistic education and a university culture that supports and promotes the full individual’s development.

##[[Highered:Libertates|Libertates University]]
_Motto: The Freedom to Nurture Learning and a Future_

**Our mission**: 
We believe in an education system that is personalized--not standardized, comprehensive but not a check-list, and exploratory not mandatory. 

**We specialize in**: Social awareness, Collaborative Learning, and Innovation

**Who we are**: 
A student-driven, living-learning community where students have the opportunity to re-imagine their learning experience in a year-round, three year program. Students have the opportunity to engage with mentors and intellectual interests in a number of customizable exploratory tracks, with the flexibility to explore the intersections and interconnectedness between these areas of focus. 

Every year, we will have a state of Libertates University address, to discuss how we are meeting our mission and what we can and should do to address our mission

**Our Location**: 
Home base location/city TBD.

Our university is mobile through collaborations with an onsite shared work-space (a la “Impact Hub”) and a Marker/Fab Lab and networks affiliated with it.
 
Our students are mobile through programs abroad and the travel/intercultural track.

Our university is part of a network of similar institutions that share similar missions.

##[[Highered:mediciu|Medici University]]

[[File:MU-FutureED-MU450.jpg]]

We live in the 21st century. Yet most universities today live in the 19th century. Education as typically experienced by the future *labor force* was designed to meet the needs of the Industrial Revolution. Universities today may *use* Information Revolution tools, but the vast majority are not offering an Information Age educational experience.

***Medici University is different.***

At Medici University we don't believe in *requirements.* We also don't believe in fees. At Medici University real education begins where arbitrary requirements end.

##[[Highered: Collaborative research masters course | Collaborative humanities research masters course]]

**Proposal**

To develop a one year collaborative research masters degree in the humanities to be delivered for between one tenth and one twentieth of the current cost of a research masters degree delivered on campus.

To deliver this one year research masters degree with student satisfaction reported at double the current satisfaction levels for campus based degrees

To impart integrated physical and digital research skills in a way that most humanities masters degrees currently fail to do, both within a specific humanities discipline and across humanities, social sciences and computational sciences

**Need**

The annual cost of delivering higher education per student per year has increased much faster than parental earnings and much faster than prospective earnings. In the United Kingdom rising delivery costs have been coupled with a radical change in the funding of higher education, with a shift from student grants to student loans.

Post-graduate education has been especially hit by accelerating costs and charges to students. Whereas undergraduate students in United Kingdom are eligible for student loans, this is not true for postgraduate students, who depend on merit based awards from research councils, limited bursaries, and on their own finances.

Postgraduate study in the humanities has been particularly affected by these changes, with significantly less funding available to humanities students than to science technology engineering and medicine students.

United Kingdom universities are now seeing a drop in the number of students embarking on one year research Masters degrees in the humanities - the traditional step in the United Kingdom for a student before embarking on a three or four year doctoral programme
