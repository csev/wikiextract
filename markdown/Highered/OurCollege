The students in Professor Davidson's face-to-face course (aka your community TAs) have created a first draft of some basic, preliminary ideas for their collaborative project on designing higher education from scratch. Please find below a "napkin sketch" for your comments and feedback from our "Designing Higher Education from Scratch" project, created by a project team in the Duke "History and Future of Higher Education" course.  For more information about this project, please see [this post](http://www.hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson/2013/11/23/what-if-we-could-build-higher-education-scratch-what-would-it-look). '

#Our College

_Motto: “Helping students engineer bridges toward our future…”_

**Background**:  In today’s world, landing a good job and a secure income often depends on graduating from a four year college. Unfortunately college completion rates for students from low-income families are significantly lower than their higher-income counterparts. While the reasons for this are complex, it is partially due to the fact that students from low-income families often do not have access to quality high school education and therefore are not equipped with the skills needed to thrive in college.

**Mission**: Our College is a small low-cost junior/community college aimed at equipping promising students with the skills they need to succeed in a rigorous higher education environment.  Our College targets the underserved population of low-income students [in the city where we are located] who enter college without the skills and support they need to succeed. 

**We value**:
*Developing student’s abilities for self-teaching and critical thinking
*Students engaging their teachers as well as their peers
*Innovative effective teaching
*Intellectual freedom for students and teachers

**We intervene by**:
*Providing underprivileged, promising students of all ages from the community where we are located low-cost access to quality learning experiences 
*Emphasizing Service Learning
*Real-world capstone project
*Structured mentorship (peer/professor)
*Offering salaries and working conditions that inspire and support professors who excel at innovative and dynamic teaching

**Our students**:
*Come from low-income families based in the region where we are located
*Are intelligent and motivated to succeed through advancing into higher education.
*Come from educational backgrounds that did not fully prepare them for the challenges of college

**Structure**:
*In order to keep costs down, Our College does not have a university campus, but rather is located in a low-cost office building in an area convenient to our student body. 
*It is a commuter school; there are no on-campus housing options.
*With the exception of college counseling, our student resources are kept to a minimum in order to keep administration small and tuition at a very affordable level. 
*Part of our administration needs would be met through a work-study program for students who would serve the university while attending classes.
*Tenure is not a feature of Our College. In lieu of tenure, all professors are paid high salaries and good benefits. Teaching performance is evaluated every three years through a combination of peer-to-peer evaluations, teaching portfolios, student outcomes, self-evaluation, and other yet-to-be-determined forms of evaluation. If a teacher receives a negative teaching evaluation, they are given one year to improve their performance. 
*Our library  is all built from electronic materials. We do not have a big physical library, but we do have thousands of books, journals, magazines which students can access at any time with PCs, tablets, PDAs.

**Pedagogy**:
*Our College focuses on the delivery of transferrable skills instead of the traditional silos or disciplines of higher education.
*Since the focus of Our College is learning how to learn, classes focus on critical thinking, rhetoric and communication, language and composition, mathematical reasoning, scientific exploration, and aesthetic interpretation.
*Our College intends to foster an environment dedicated to student learning.  Teachers at Our College recognize that students learn in a variety of ways, and they are dedicated to a constant review of teaching methods and practices.
*Our college has many linkages with industry for practical, hands-on experience of our students. Faculty are mostly industry experts, who teach on a part-time basis.
