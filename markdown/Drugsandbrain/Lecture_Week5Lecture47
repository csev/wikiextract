An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 47 Bipolar Disorder. Drugs and Other Therapies   
* Hello, we're back talking about drugs and molecules, rather than about personalities in the context of bipolar disorder.  

**Therapeutic approaches to bipolar disorder**  
* In terms of therapeutic approaches to bipolar disorder, a very important statement is that many bipolar patients avoid therapy, or remain only partially compliant because they don't wish to give up the pleasant feelings during the manic phase.  

* Among the most important points to be made is that noncompliant patients may risk suicide. DSM-IV cautions that the presence in a depressed patient of a positive family history of bipolar disorder or acute psychosis probably increases the chances that the patient's own depressive disorder is a manifestation of bipolar rather than unipolar disorder and that antidepressant therapy may incite a switch into mania.  

* In other words, psychiatrists have a lot of concern that if a patient is in major depressive patient rather than a unipolar depressive patient, giving that patient an antidepressant may precipitate mania, and so this is a constant concern for bipolar therapy. Added to that concern is the fact that DSM-V may reclassify some major depressive disorders as actually being on the bipolar spectrum instead, and this would then have major ramifications for how one takes drugs to suppress bipolar disorder. We'll all have to stay tuned about this possibility.  

**Therapeutic approaches to bipolar disorder (slide 2)**  
* In addition to drug approaches to bipolar disorder, we should talk about surgical and electrical intervention. Lobotomy or psycho-surgery, was used in the 1950s and 60s and removed large portions of the brain. These types of surgeries are no longer performed.  

* Electroconvulsive shock therapy should be distinguished from deep brain stimulation which is much more delicate takes place within the brain and at much lower voltages. ECT, electroconvulsive shock therapy is now administered under anesthesia for instance muscle relaxants, so that there are no muscle convulsions. There are various placements of the electrodes pulse widths, pulse durations, and frequencies. And excellent psychiatrists believe that there are situations in which ECT, electroconvulsive therapy is indeed a highly effective treatment for severe depressive episodes.  

* Now, how does ECT work? It is transient and over 100 theories have been offered to account for the efficacy of ECT. these range from the molecular to the systems and none of them have been proven, but they all remain viable hypotheses.  

**Therapeutic approaches to bipolar disorder: Drugs for Bipolar Disease**  
* The drug therapy approaches to bipolar disorder of course, began with Lithium. The Lithium ion is a very simple one, on the periodic table it's just above Sodium and the four blue colored ions here are the ones that we usually think about in drugs in the brain: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium.  
* We don't really understand how Lithium works. Itâ€™s therapeutic effects begin in less than five days and require several weeks. Lithium is quite poisonous at higher doses eliciting convulsions and so patients need to be monitored carefully.  
* Indeed, drugs that were originally discovered as anticonvulsants are also used for bipolar disorder. They also require several weeks for full effects. We don't understand how these drugs work either.  

* The general statement that people with manic symptoms may be more active neurally than people without manic symptoms, has been invoked as a way of explaining that anticonvulsants might be quieting down excess neuronal activity. But in fact, we have no reason to believe that Valproic Acid or Lamotrigine,  both approved for bipolar therapy are acting on ion channels or even that they're acting outside the cell. So there are lots of mysteries about drugs originally discovered as anticonvulsants used for bipolar therapy, but they do work.  

**Five exemplar patients in the early days of Li+**  
* Lithium was discovered in the 50s and 60s as a bipolar drug. And here are five example patients in the very early days of experimentation using Lithium.  

* Here's a patient who had mostly manic episodes. When he started Lithium he was rather well-controlled. This patient also had manic episodes and one depressive episode, Lithium helped. This patient, mostly depressed, this one through bipolar also helped with lithium, and this patient as well.  
* So there's no doubt that lithium works, but how does it work? How is it acting? We really don't know, but there are some good guesses. All ideas about lithium assume an intracellular target and that is simply because no high affinity extra-cellular receptor has been identified for lithium as is also true for Valproic {Acid}.  

* So this is not to say that Lithium and Valproic {Acid} are acting in an inside-out fashion in the endoplasmic reticulum and as molecular chaperone's. But, it is impressive that we simply assume that they work intracellularly.   

* Lithium does enter cells through several channels and ion coupled transporters that normally serve for that for sodium which, as you'll remember, is just below lithium on the periodic table as a monovalent cation.  

* The therapeutic concentrations of lithium, intra cellular, are probably several millimolars. Most of the ideas about lithium involve its ability to inhibit enzymes and most of the suspected enzymes manipulate high energy phosphate bonds. They are kinases or phosphatases, but which ones are not clear. We'll have to stay tuned for this very interesting story.  

**Antipsychotics in bipolar disease**  
* Antipsychotics are also used in bipolar disease. We will discuss antipsychotics in greater length when we talk about schizophrenia in the next few lectures.  
* In 2006, the FDA approved quetiapine,  an antipsychotic for managing mania and hypomanic episodes in bipolar disease. And Risperidone is also used off-label.  

* One should also point out that psychotherapy is a useful adjunct to medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy, which we mentioned in connection with major depression, family focused therapy, so that family members understand how to deal with a bipolar patient, Interpersonal, social rhythm therapy, and psychoeducation that teaches people with bipolar disorder about the illness and its treatment.  

* So that brings our discussion of bipolar disorder to an end. I hope it's given some useful knowledge, but we have a lot more we need to learn about bipolar disorder.
