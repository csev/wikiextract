An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 44 Major depression. Additional Antidepressant Mechanisms 
* This lecture continues our discussion of antidepressant drugs and how they might be acting.  

**Neurogenesis in the hippocampus**   

* The first topic is neurogenesis. In adult rodents, and in adult monkeys, and perhaps in adult humans, it's not yet certain, new neurons form continuously from progenitor cells, a type of restricted stem cell located near the hippocampus, in a place called the subgranular zone.  

* These neurons differentiate; they become incorporated into neuronal circuits in a region of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus;  so they become granule cells in the granule cell layer and extend their dendrites into the molecular layer, ML.   

* It is thought that these newly born migrated neurons, maybe more active and may have special characteristics that the mature neurons don't. And so the thinking is that perhaps, these new neurons are more important for antidepressant actions than are the remaining adult neurons.  

**How might adult neurogenesis influence antidepressant action?**  
* Now it is very clear that some antidepressants do result in additional hippocampal neurogenesis. Not clear whether this happens in people, but clear in mice. And so, the question becomes how do antidepressants produce neurogenesis?  

* The possibility is that the antidepressants result in the release of growth factors, of the sort that we have already discussed and that these then produce new neurogenesis; that the newly derived neurons become incorporated into hippocampal circuitry. And this then, via the diagrams that we saw in mini Lecture 42 might affect the ventral brain, the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, as well as the prefrontal cortex. And might in turn, be influenced by other brain regions including the HPA axis. So, whether and to what extent neurogenesis is involved in antidepressant action remains to be seen over the next few years.  

  
**Some Antidepressants are “SNRIs”, Serotonin/Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors**  
* I want to remind you also that some modern antidepressants are not simply serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but mixed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. And so, many experts ask, how does blockage of noradrenaline reuptake, relieve depression via the presumed outside-in mechanisms?  

* You'll remember that the locus coeruleus is near the Raphe {nucleus}. It has most of the noradrenergic neurons in the brain, and these noradrenergic neurons project to many areas of the brain. We don't need to think about noradrenaline activated ion channels here, because there are no noradrenaline activated ion channels among vertebrates. We need to think simply about G protein coupled receptors and the usual outside-in mechanisms.   

  
**Acute low-dose ketamine produces antidepressant effects within 2 hr. How?**  
* Now, a very interesting recent theme involves a possible way to get around the problem posed by the two to three week therapeutic lag. Depressed patients would like to be helped much more rapidly and how can one do that?  

* Well, ketamine is known as a dissociative anesthetic. It produces an altered state of reality, among many people, and it is a street drug or recreational drug, where it is also called Special K. It is also used as an anesthetic in veterinary practice, no longer for humans. Over the last ten years it has become clear that acute rather low dose ketamine also produces antidepressant actions within about two hours in people and in the animal models for antidepressant action that I described in a previous lecture. Well, how do these antidepressants actions come about and would it be possible to improve ketamine or to make a derivative of ketamine, here is ketamine that might to act better?  

* First, of course, we need to understand how ketamine actually works. Well very nice recent papers from excellent scientists, show that the effects on antidepressant action do involve BDNF synthesis and release, at least partially. So it appears that the presence of ketamine does result in the secretion of BDNF. And so, now we plug into the growth factor BDNF story that I've been telling you about antidepressant action.   

* It's also clear, recently, that these effects occur in the dendrites as opposed to the soma of neurons.  

* Also, the effects require the synthesis of new proteins, not gene transcription, which does not place, take place in the dendrites, but simply protein synthesis. Dendrites do have endoplasmic reticulum, where membrane-bound proteins and secretory proteins can be made. They do have Golgi apparatus, so that many molecules including BDNF can be synthesized within the dendrite, based on mRNA that has been shipped there from the cell body. These newly synthesized molecules can be secreted right away. And, in keeping with these observations, the dendritic actions do not require the activation of genes, but they do require the translation of proteins.  
* Now, the best-known action of ketamine is on NMDA-type glutamate receptors. You'll remember from previous lectures that NMDA receptors have the remarkable property that they are permeant to calcium. And they therefore, can act as coincidence detectors and be involved in memory and learning; this is not a topic that we can discuss in this course. And so the hypothesis has been that blocking these NMDA receptors in dendrites.  
* So this is a picture of a dendrite blocking NMDA receptors at rest leads to decreased calcium influx as part of the ongoing activity in a functioning nervous system. This decreased calcium influx acts as usual, as an intracellular messenger, changing the action of some calcium activated kinases and it is appreciated that when RNA-binding proteins get phosphorylated they change their ability to influence the translation of RNA in the dendrites. And so, this changed influence might result in the expression of more BDNF, export from the endoplasmic reticulum, export through the Golgi, trafficking to the cell membrane and the release. So, that's the dominant theory these days.  
* There are lots of advantages to this theory, but two major disadvantages. First of all, the action of ketamine is thought to be on basal synaptic transmission. Now, baseline synaptic transmission in the brain is not particularly strong. It's possible that there is a subset of neurons that really are working very hard and that it's this subset that is influenced by ketamine.  

* The second problem with the blockade hypothesis is that one can calculate that the concentration of ketamine, these sub-anesthetic very low doses of ketamine is actually not quite high enough to block the NMDA receptors. So, that's a problem for this so-called outside-in model. So how does one get around that?  
* Well, there is one possibility that there is another receptor for ketamine or receptors sensitive to ketamine that might be involved in this entire story. That's a possibility, but the other point to be made is that I've told you that nicotine acts as a chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum at much lower concentrations than at the plasma membrane. So, this brings up the possibility of an inside-out action for ketamine.  
* The idea would be that ketamine-like, almost every drug we've discussed has a deprotonated neutral form, that this deprotonated neutral form can enter cells, can enter the endoplasmic reticulum. And there, one of two or three things might happen. For one thing, ketamine might act as a chaperone for NMDA receptors being made. This would influence the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress pathway that I described to you during the final lecture on Parkinson's disease. This could change the state of the physiology of the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in more BDNF secretion, possibly by kinase pathways, that would again bind to mRNA but different kinases than the one in the outside-in version.  

* The other possibility is that the NMDA receptors and BDNF do form a complex and would escort each other out of the endoplasmic reticulum out of the Golgi apparatus. And the ultimate result would be the secretion of BDNF, but via an inside-out rather than an outside-in pathway. Well, I would dearly love to be able to test hypothesis of this sort over the next few years. And the goal of providing a more rapid antidepressant is certainly a good one.  

* That does it for antidepressants and next time we will talk about bipolar disease.
