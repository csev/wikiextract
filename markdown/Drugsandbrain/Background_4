**Therapeutic use of Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (and optogenetics)**  
* I found a fascinating paper on the therapeutic use of Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease. This paper is also an interesting introduction to the use of [optogenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) from Karl Deisseroth's lab at Stanford.
