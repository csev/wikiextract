An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 22 Drugs Bind to Neurotransmitter Transporters  

* Hello, we are discussing neurotransmitter transporters. These are very cool molecules, and they are the third major class of targets in drugs and the brain.

**Slide>> To most experts, success of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) implies participation of serotonergic systems in the brain**
* As usual, we start with a system or a nucleus in the brain that can focus our attention on the target under discussion. And, certainly, for the neurotransmitter transporters, part of the focus needs to be on the cells that make serotonin, the so called Raphe nuclei. 
 
* In the midbrain, there are two major systems, the rostral and the caudal. They project to many regions of the brain and modulate synaptic transmissions and neuronal excitability in many areas of the brain. To most experts, the success of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRI's implies participation of serotonergic systems in depression.

**Slide>> 3 classes of proteins transport ions across membranes**
* In order to understand neurotransmitter transporters, we need to distinguish three major classes of proteins that transport ions and other molecules across membranes.  

* We've already discussed ion channels. Ion channels, flux many ions, per conformational change, that opens or closes them. And we will discuss them further, in this lecture.  

* Two other systems that transport ions include, the active transporters, or pumps, that split ATP, in order to bring, ions across the membrane. There are three major classes of such ion pumps. We'll discuss two of them today.  

* But really the hero of the story today, are the ion coupled transporters. These bring small molecules across the membrane, by harnessing the gradient set up by the pumps. Let's explain this a little more.

**Slide>> First, Na+-coupled cell membrane neurotransmitter transporters …**
* First of all let's talk about how neural transmitters get into pre-synaptic terminals. Of course, sometimes they are made in pre-synaptic terminals. But in addition, after they are released into the synaptic cleft, sodium coupled with cell membrane neurotransmitter transporters utilize the preexisting sodium concentration gradient that was originally established by the so-called sodium pump. We also call the sodium pump the sodium-potassium ATPase.  

* So we have little sodium inside a neuron or inside most cells. We have a lot of sodium outside. And so the cell can utilize this gradient of sodium to drive small organic molecules into the cytosol against their concentration gradient. More on how this occurs in the next mini-lecture.  
  
* But we have here in the plasma membrane the sodium coupled cell membrane transporter, neurotransmitter transporters, and here we are depicting either the one for serotonin or a different one for dopamine. As we'll see, there are several classes of sodium-coupled cell membrane neurotransmitter transporters.

**Slide>> Plasma Membrane Neurotransmitter Transporter Genes**
* Once the neurotransmitter gets into the cytosol there's a second ion-coupled neurotransmitter transporter that brings the transmitter into the synaptic vesicle. This is a proton-coupled vesicular neurotransmitter transporter.  

* It utilizes the proton gradient, the hydrogen ion gradient that was originally established by a different ATP coupled pump. This is the proton ATPase  which exist in the membrane of the synaptic vesicle so; there is a ATP driven proton pump that puts protons into the synaptic vesicle, and the proton-coupled neurotransmitter transporter that exists in the synaptic vesicle membrane and exchanges those protons for neurotransmitter.  

* So, we have four types of transporters getting neurotransmitter into the synaptic vesicle. In the. Plasma membrane going back a slide, we have the sodium pump and the sodium coupled, cell membrane transporter, and then in the, synaptic vesicle membrane, we have the, proton pump, also driven by ATP, like the sodium pump, and the proton coupled neurotransmitter, transporter.  

* As a result the synaptic vesicle contains neurotransmitter, the synaptic vesicle also contains ATP. Possibly, the ATP serves a useful function because it's negatively charged, of neutralizing the positive charge on the neurotransmitter. But also, there are post synaptic receptors for ATP which we're not going to have the chance to discuss in this course.  

* On the whole then, the synaptic vesicle contains between 1,000 and 10,000 molecules of  neurotransmitter and ATP. In fact, it’s nearly isotonic, because it's so small. It's about 100 nanometers in diameter.

**Slide>> MDMA or Amphetamines Release Transmitter into the External Medium**
* Let's talk now about the plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporter genes, because since they are on the plasma membrane they are much more susceptible to binding drugs than are the intra-cellular transporters. But as we'll see, the intracellular transporters can also bind some drugs.  
* There are families of plasma membrane neurotransporter genes. There is one for serotonin, and it's abbreviated: SERT. There's one for dopamine, abbreviated DAT,  dopamine transporter; and one for norepinephrine, also called noradrenaline and that one is called NET.  

* For GABA there are four plasma membrane transporter genes. We'll discuss them in the next lecture. And for glutamate, there are various abbreviations, there are about five genes for glutamate transporters. Their ligands have no known clinical uses so we won't discuss them much.  
* Now plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters have two major jobs. First, they terminate the action of the neurotransmitter, and second, they replenish the supply of neurotransmitter in the presynaptic terminal, where it can then be loaded into synaptic vesicles. I'm going to prove to you that both of these actions are important in a special system, but before doing that, it is necessary to explain how MDMA, or amphetamines, release transmitter into the external medium.   

* So, here is MDMA, also called ecstasy. It can exist in either the protonated or the deprotonated form. Here is a synaptic vesicle. The experiments I'm going to tell you about today were done mostly with serotonin-containing vesicles, although the same kinds of events may also happen with dopamine containing vesicles.  

* So first, a person takes in MDMA. It gets into the cerebrospinal fluid, into the areas surrounding a neuron, and from the areas surrounding a neuron; it passively diffuses through the plasma membrane as well as through the vesicle membrane because it's a neutral molecule.  
* And so it enters the serotonin vesicle. Now in the serotonin vesicle, it can pick up a proton, so it becomes MDMA protonated.  Right here is a secondary amine, and it can pick up a proton. Now, in its protonated form it becomes a substrate. That is, it becomes able to be transported by the proton-coupled vesicular serotonin transporter.  

* And so it leaves the vesicle via that transporter. It leaves via that transporter because transporters can run in reverse when the concentrations of their transporter substrates are reversed from the usual concentrations. They are simply thermodynamic machines. They can run in either direction, depending on their ionic gradients, more about this in the next lecture.  

* So, because MDMA is transporting protons out of the vesicle, it is in fact dissipating the vesicle's proton store. This prevents the vesicle from transporting serotonin in through the proton coupled vesicular serotonin transporter. So, the vesicle empties.  

* When the vesicle empties into the cytosol, the same kind of reverse transport happens at SERT, the plasma membrane seratonin transporter. The result is that, MDMA or amphetamines release transmitter into the external medium, where they can act on other neurons. Now, with this in mind, we can go and understand the point that neurotransmitter transporters both terminate the action of transmitters and also replenish transmitter concentrations in the synaptic cleft.

**Slide>> Electrochemical measurements allow experiments to detect dopamine…**
* And, to show this, we need one more fact, and this is a cute gadget. It is a micro-pipette with a carbon fiber at the end. It allows us to do electro-chemical measurements, so that we can detect dopamine in a solution by oxidizing the catechol moiety, the adjacent hydroxyl groups.  

* Of course when we oxidize a chemical, we take its electrons, those electrons go into the carbon fiber, produce a current which can be measured by a sensitive ammeter and it get returned to the medium. Clearly, the nature of the current carrier gets changed several times, when electrons leave, when current goes into the carbon fiber, when current goes from the carbon fiber to an electrode inside the pipette. We're not going to worry about that in this lecture, or in this course. The result, though, is that we actually have currents which are proportional to the concentration of dopamine in the external medium.

**Slide>> In dopamine transporter knockout mice  (“DAT -/-”)…**
* So, what happens now? Well, the other fact that we need to know is that there exist mice that are knockouts for the dopamine transporter. That is, these are mice that have been engineered, so that both chromosomes lack the dopamine transporter. They're called knockout mice and they're useful in studies of drugs and the brain and in neuroscience. And these mice are healthy and lead happy lives.  

* When we give stimuli to the presynaptic nerves that could release dopamine, let's see what happens. Plus, plus means here are mice that have normal,  happy DAT, dopamine transporter. Minus, minus are the knockout mice for the dopamine transporter, and we are using electrochemistry to measure the concentration of dopamine near the pre-synaptic neurons.  

* So in the normal mouse, with two copies of the dopamine transporter, we give a stimulus. We are measuring the amount of dopamine using electro-chemistry. It rises to a peak in less than a second. And then it decays, in about a second, rises to a peak because the dopamine is released from the pre-synaptic terminals, it decays because the dopamine transporter is taking it up into the neuron. 
 
* In the dopamine transporter knockout mice, there is less dopamine in the presynaptic nerves. So that pulse of dopamine is not so high, and very importantly it takes a lot longer to clear, because the dopamine transporter is absent. 
 
* When we add amphetamine, we slowly, in the normal mouse, we slowly release more dopamine even without nerve impulses, just on its own. And then subsequent stimuli release less and less dopamine because there's little in the nerve terminal to be packed into those synaptic vesicles to be released.  

* In the knockout mouse, we are releasing less dopamine in the first place. And the amphetamine releases much less dopamine again, because there is less dopamine around. So, this tells us that the dopamine transporter is responsible both, for building up the dopamine in the pre-synaptic terminal and for terminating the action of dopamine once it's released.

**Slide>> Na+-coupled cell membrane neurotransmitter transporters…**
* So, in short, sodium coupled neurotransmitter transporters in the plasma membrane are major targets for drugs of therapy and abuse.  
* {In serotonergic neurons} Antidepressants are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. Drugs of abuse, MDMA for instance, at cell membrane serotonin transporters.  

* In dopaminergic neurons, carrying the dopamine transporter, important uses for Attention Deficit Disorder medications, various derivatives of amphetamines are used for ADD and ADHD. And also, cell membrane dopamine transporters are targets for drugs of abuse including cocaine and the amphetamines.  

* Next time we'll talk about neurotransmitter transporters as  molecules.
