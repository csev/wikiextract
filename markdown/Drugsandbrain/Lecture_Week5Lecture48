An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 48 Schizophrenia Clinical Description; Genetics..

* {Music - David Helfgott playing Rachmaninov Piano Concert #3} 
* Today, we are going to talk about Schizophrenia. It's the last of the major neuroscience diseases that we will discuss.  

* We're going to follow our usual procedure of discussing first, the clinical description. Then, what we know about the genetics. Then, pathophysiology, which I call, for schizophrenia, a century of frustration. Then we'll discuss biomarkers and animal models, then heterozygote advantage. We'll make short shrift of that, because there probably is no heterozygote advantage in schizophrenia. And then we'll talk about, drug therapies for schizophrenia.  

**Clinical description**  
* The major clinical description of a schizophrenic, for instance, DSM-IV, consists of positive symptoms: delusions, hallucinations and thought disorder. You can see many simulated interviews with schizophrenics on YouTube, played by actors.  
* Schizophrenia also includes some negative symptoms: decreased motivation, diminished emotional expression, some motor abnormalities, posturing, impaired coordination, catatonia, in which the patient usually does not move much and, very importantly, cognitive deficits, impairments in attention, in executive function, some types of memory.  
* In retrospect, but usually only in retrospect, there were prodromal signs: “He was weird, even as a child.”  Socially isolated, withdrawn, perhaps impaired in normal function with playmates and classmates, perhaps odd behavior, ideas, again, a blunted affect and poor personal hygiene.  

* But this is only in retrospect. So, this range of clinical features The positive symptoms, the delusions, the decreased motivation, the motor symptoms, the cognitive symptoms suggest that schizophrenia actually affects several complex brain systems. So it is really a very challenging disease.

**”He saw the world in a way no could have imagined”**
* There have been a couple of very good recent movies, describing schizophrenics. A Beautiful Mind, the story of John Nash, the great mathematician, portrays schizophrenia largely in terms of visual hallucinations. For instance, the implant into his arm, the scenes at the CIA, these drawings and that is really not typical of a schizophrenic. Most schizophrenics have auditory rather than visual hallucinations. But for a movie that’s what one is forced to do.  

**Genetics**     
* Now, what does one mean by a complex disease such as schizophrenia, or depression or bipolar disease? What is a complex psychiatric disease? It has three characteristics.  
* The first characteristic is genetics. Schizophrenia is polygenic. The disease occurs only if several genotypes are present together. Among identical twins there is a very strong concordance, that is if one member of a twin pair has schizophrenia, there's roughly a 50% chance that the other does as well. They share 100% of their genetic material. Among people who share 50% of their genetic material, fraternal twins, children, siblings, parents, the concordance is much less It's much less again among people who share 25%, and less again among people such as first cousins who share 12.5%. I don't think anybody understands the differences among the 50% or among the 25%.  

* Finally, when one gets to the general public and one simply asks, what is the chance that one, anyone randomly selected person will have schizophrenia? That is more or less independent of culture. The diagnosis rates may vary by a factor of two or three among cultures and is around 1%. So one aspect, of a complex disease, is certainly the fact that it's polygenic.  

* Another aspect is that it is partially penetrant. Note that the concordance among identical twins is only 50%, not 100%. So this means that nongenetic, or, what we call now, epigenetic factors are required, or the disease is inherently random. It occurs at a low probability in life, sometimes one gets it, and another person one does not.   

* And a final characteristic is that schizophrenia like most complex diseases are genetically multi factorial. That is, if we map disease genes say in an Icelandic population, we may at some point in the future be lucky enough find ten genes which together cause schizophrenia. If we now take another population elsewhere in the world, we might find nine, or ten, or eleven genes, but they may be totally different genes, from the ones in Iceland. And so that, we have these multifactorial genes, where, several types of collections of mutations, all come together to form this one clinical phenotype, that we might call schizophrenia. So { schizophrenia is} a very complex disease, very challenging to study.  

**8p21, site of recent schizophrenia linkages, including these genes**  
* Nonetheless, there has been a lot of activity on mapping genes for schizophrenia. Here is a region in chromosome 8, the P part of the chromosome, the short arm, band number 21. And it includes several genes that have been link to schizophrenia: neuregilin which we will discuss a bit more, frizzle, a gene involved in neuronal fate and the vesicular monoamine transporter number one, we call this VMAT. And as we've discussed it in previous lectures: calcineurin, a phosphatase, and a growth receptor as well.  
* So,there are several interesting regions of genomes, this is certainly one of them and you can get a feeling for genome wide association scans from going back to mini Lecture 30.


**ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity)**  
* A particularly interesting set of schizophrenia associated genes may be the neuregulin. The first of this family that was identified some three decades ago, called Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity or ARIA, was first discovered at the nerve muscle synapse in the periphery secreted by the nerve.  

* The general family {of neuregulins} consists of transmembrane proteins, they are proteolyzed, that is an enzyme cuts them to release a growth factor with a domain that has been called an epidermal growth factor-like domain or EGF domain. Some neuregulins are cleaved by a protease just once, to form a released fragment which then acts on other cells. Other neuregulins, for instance the type 3, need to be cleaved twice to release the fragment, that again acts on other cells.

**Large deletions / duplications are associated with schizophrenia**  
* The cost of DNA sequencing continues to decrease and its throughput continues to increase. As a result, recently it is been possible to sequence, base by base, large portions of the genome of schizophrenia patients.   

* And these investigations have involved both the kinds of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs that I told you about in mini lecture 30 where you don't actually sequence the entire genome, you look only at a small fraction of the sequences. And the kind of large scale sequencing, base by base, that allows one to assess copy number variations {CNVs} which are deletions, or duplications of DNA that might be several tens of kilobases, or hundreds of kilobases in length. 

* The conclusion of this study is that common genetic variance that might account for 10, or 20, or 30% of the population, actually don't seem to be important for causing schizophrenia, even if there are many of them occurring together.  Instead, these copy number variations {CNVs} contribute to a rather small minority of schizophrenia cases, so far. But the hope is that the more schizophrenia cases that one sequences, and the more complete sequencing coverage that one gets, one can find mutations associated with schizophrenia.  

* So, one molecule of interest has been rediscovered with this technique. it's called DISC1, or disrupted in schizophrenia. And previous data had shown that it causes psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia in one family. It's a famous mutation. But, all the other events did not seem to focus on one particular pathway. So, we'll have to see over the next few of years, whether improved sequencing techniques really do allow us to find more genes associated with schizophrenia.
