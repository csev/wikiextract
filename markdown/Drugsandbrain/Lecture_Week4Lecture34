An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 34 Alzheimer's disease-Biomarkers & therapeutic approachestext  

* Hello, our final lecture on, Alzheimer's disease, is going to talk about animal models, and bio-markers, and therapeutic approaches, to Alzheimer's disease.

**Slide>>Animal models**
*  Experimenters, in modern neuroscience, have a series of animal models, for Alzheimer's disease. Especially mice, especially mice that over produce APP amyloid precursor protein. And other mice that have mutations in presenilins, again especially with Alzheimer's disease associated mutations. So there is some progress. And the, challenge, is to make data from mice relevant to those with people.

**Slide>>Biomarkers for AD.**
* Now, in general, what does one want to do, for Alzheimer's disease. Well, as for Parkinson's disease, which we'll discuss in the, next series, you would like, to do two things, for Alzheimer's. You would like to find a person with early stage Alzheimer's and stop that early stage Alzheimer's from progressing any further, if you get it early enough. Why, that's a remarkable change in the time course of the disease, if you can stop it from progressing. The way to stop it from progressing early enough is either to have a very good neurological or psychiatric diagnosis. Or to have a so called bio marker, that is an objective measurement either bio chemical or physiological that tells you, yes this person has very early stage Alzheimer's without a doubt.  
* Now we are not far along on either of those challenges. Some of the new data suggest that if you take measurements of the tau, remember the tau protein,and phosphorylated tau, and of A&beta;42 and look at the individual values, or the ratios among these you can get a fairly early diagnosis, of Alzheimer's disease.  
* Another fruitful approach has just been approved by the FDA, the US Food and Drug Administration. It's a molecule, called, Florbetapir. It seems to bind to amyloid plaques that contain &beta;-APP. Here's the structure and here is the {fluorine radioactive isotope} F18, which emits beta particles, that's why it's called Florbetapir. So here is a typical positron emission tomography of a person who does not have Alzheimer's disease. Very few plaques, very few places, plaque places, for Florbetapir to bind. Here's a person who, by other criteria, does have Alzheimer's disease. Clearly, there is a lot more binding, of Florbetapir. So, one needs to be extremely careful, about these scans, as they're called.  
* And here are the words that the manufacturer uses. A negative scan, sparse to no neuritic plaques, inconsistent with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the time the image is made. So probably that patient does not have Alzheimer's disease. Since the patient goes to a neurologist in the first place for cognitive impairment among other complaints, then that cognitive impairment is not Alzheimer's.  
* Now, of course, one needs to be very careful and say that a positive scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid plaques. And that some patients with these kinds of plaques also have Alzheimer's. But there are examples of people with other types of neurological conditions, as well as older people with normal cognition who show positive scans. So, the manufacturer says very carefully, Florbetapir is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. More than this we can't say, at the moment, we hope for better biomarkers.

**Slide>>Heterozygote advantage: none known**
*  Again, heterozygote advantage does not seem to exist for Alzheimer's so we'll leave that go until we get to depression and let's look now at therapeutic approaches.  
* Suppose a person is diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's, what can be done? Well the molecules that are in the clinic now and that are the molecules of choice are the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors because neurons that make acetylcholine are among the first to die in Alzheimer's disease. They're in the basal forebrain and therefore, if one can prolong the life of acetylcholine by inhibiting its breakdown by Acetylcholinesterase one has more acetylcholine. And the lack, relative lack of cholinergic neurons does not matter much. The three {Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors} that are on the market are somewhat effective. Interestingly enough, galantamine, may also be a positive allosteric modulator of &alpha;4&beta;2 receptors, so that, it could be acting, both, by preventing the breakdown, of acetylcholine, and by enhancing its action.  
* Also on the market is one NMDA inhibitor, called memantine, and the thinking here is that excessive activity at NMDA receptors may be excitotoxic. And so, it may be possible to slow down the time course of Alzheimer's using memantine. For both of these types of medications, the slowing down is statistically significant but we need very much better drugs.  
* So, because we've talked about that the various secretase sites in &beta;-APP, you can appreciate that &beta;-secretase inhibitors would also be useful if one could develop them with no side effects and specific action. There have been other drugs {latrepirdine = dimebolon} with unknown mechanisms that failed for Alzheimer's trials.

**Slide>>Î³-secretase inhibitors such as semagecestat have failed so far**
* &gamma;-secretase inhibitors might also be useful. The one that got the furthest along in clinical trials also failed. One could think about targeting the protease complex with Notch-sparing &gamma;-secretase inhibitors. Remember the probable natural function of &gamma;-secretase is to, proteolyze Notch {protein}. So you'd need to develop a &gamma;-secretase inhibitor which allows Notch proteolysis to go ahead but blocks cleavage of the APP. And other &gamma;-secretase drugs, modulators that shift the proportion of A&beta; peptides, in favor of shorter, less harmful, peptides. have been conceived, but not brought to the clinic.  
* And then there's the topic of antibodies against &beta;-APP or A&beta;. And the three that had been tried so far in clinical trials are listed here {Gantenerumab, Solanezumab, and Bapineuzumab}. The have been largely unsuccessful, although one of them has been mildly successful in early stage of Alzheimer's.  
* So, clearly, Alzheimer's therapy has a very long way to go. Next time we will continue or discussion of neurodegenerative diseases by talking about Parkinson's disease.
