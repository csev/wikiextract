An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 50 Schizophrenia Nongenetic contributions, Biomarkers, & Animal Models  
* Hi there we're going to talk about several additional topics before we go on to talk about drugs for schizophrenia. So in this lecture we'll discuss non genetic contributions to schizophrenia. We'll discuss biomarkers and we'll discuss animal models for schizophrenia.  

**Nongenetic contributions: the other ~50%**  
* Why is the maximum concordance for schizophrenia only 50 percent? What are the non-genetic contributions to Schizophrenia risk?  

* Well, one important characteristic may be nourishment and health of the fetus. Viral infections during pregnancy could affect one fetus and not the other (though this would not apply to identical twins which shared the same fetal environment) possibly leading to low-level inflammation. My colleague Professor Paul Patterson at Caltech studies this and there are good historical examples, mostly from wars, of malnourished population, and a few months later the rate of schizophrenia, among children, later measured as adults was greater than under normal populations. So low level inflammation, possibly interacting with schizophrenia susceptibility genes, is a factor that must be considered.  

* Another factor is head injury. A friend who is a psychiatrist has taken me on his interviews with schizophrenic patients and he always asks: “Have you recently had a head injury before you started to display the schizophrenic symptoms?” A sudden or traumatic head injury has been known to precipitate schizophrenia, again possibly in association with schizophrenia susceptible genes.  

* And then we will very briefly say that for some diseases, especially bipolar disease, a small dose of susceptibility genes may confer a selective advantage in bipolar disease by making a person livelier, more fascinating, etc. There is no known heterozygote advantage associated with schizophrenia.  

**Biomarkers for schizophrenia**  
* Biomarkers are important for research in the neural diseases because they provide an objective way of measuring, independent of a full neurological or psychiatric workup, a blood test or an easy physiological measurement that can be repeated often to monitor the progression , or the protection against a disease.  

* For schizophrenia we're going to talk about electroencephalograms, which are recordings from the brain, and in people, from outside the skull. There are also measurements that one can make of eye movements. We won't discuss them here.  

**Sensory gating anomaly measured electrophysiologically**  
* So the electroencephalogram {EEG} measurements are often called sensory gating, or in people, they are called P50, because the key measurement takes place 50 milliseconds after the stimulus. These sensory gating measurements can be made with external electrodes on people, but here in some data from mice we see recordings from Bruce Cohen, who's involved in teaching this course.  

* Bruce has put electrodes in the hippocampus of a mouse and has given two clicks about half a second apart. The first click evokes complex recording in the hippocampus, the second click evokes much lower responses in the hippocampus. So it's as though the synapses activated during the first click, inhibit the response to the second click. Now, what does this have to do with schizophrenia?  

* First, it's well known that some schizophrenics have trouble tuning out repetitive and continued noises. A favorite statement is that the noise of the lawn mower or the noise of the vacuum cleaner sometimes triggers hallucinations.  

* Second, and remarkably enough, this, this, sensory gating anomaly occurs in most schizophrenics, 90%, but I should hasten to add that it also occurs in 8% of the general population, whereas you'll remember that only 1% of the general population has schizophrenia. So, sensory gating is not predictive of schizophrenia in any sense at all.  


* But interestingly enough. if one looks at the healthy relatives of schizophrenics, and asks about the genetics, of, the sensory gating anomaly, one finds that the sensory gating anomaly, in which the, second wave, is almost as large as the first wave, that anomaly is inherited in a simple Mendelian all or none manner, and it's autosomal dominant. That is, one needs only one apparent copy of the gene to get this sensory gating anomaly.  

* So here is a family with two schizophrenics in it and several normal people. These schizophrenics have dark boxes. The sensory gating, the P50 ratios, are considered abnormal, or anomalous, if they're greater than 0.5, and normal, if they're less than 0.5. So both of the schizophrenics have this sensory gating anomaly, but, interestingly enough, one of the parents who is a carrier, also has this sensory gating anomaly, but, he is not schizophrenic, he is normal, and, some of the siblings have the anomaly, some do not. So, here are the healthy relatives of schizophrenics, in which we see autosomal dominant transmission, of the anomaly. Interestingly enough, this trait maps to the vicinity, of the &alpha;seven nicotinic receptor on chromosome 15, and we'll treat that a bit later in our next lecture.  

**Animal models for schizophrenia**  
* An animal model for schizophrenia would be desirable, and there are several in fact. There is sensory gating, which we saw in the previous slide.  

* In mice, there's ultrasonic vocalization. Now, most people think that mice are pretty quiet. But in fact, they do vocalize a great deal in the ultrasonic range, and one can detect these vocalizations with a monitor that's usually used to locate bats.  

* Mouse models of schizophrenia have abnormal vocalization. Mouse models of schizophrenia also have abnormal social behavior, and they do not groom so well. The classic mouse model, which is the DISC1 knockout, you'll remember that DISC1 is disrupted in schizophrenia, shows defects in social behavior and in grooming.  

* Finally, there is amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. You'll remember from previous lectures, for instance, on recreational drugs, that amphetamine releases dopamine, and in the striatum, this causes increased motor activity. You'll learn in the next lecture, that many anti-psychotic drugs are dopamine antagonists, and so the idea came about, well, why don't we see whether candidate anti-psychotic drugs can suppress this dopamine mediated behavior?  
* And indeed, all known anti-psychotic drugs do suppress this dopamine mediated behavior in mice. Well here is a candidate anti-psychotic drug which is not a dopamine receptor inhibitor but it inhibits a kinase downstream from ErbB4. And we've learned that ErbB4 may be associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia.  

* So, one puts a mouse in a new cage, measures the amount the animal moves around, using automatic apparatus. When a mouse gets into a new cage, it likes to explore. It habituates to this exploration. The mice then get an injection of amphetamine. Now, when the mice get the injection of amphetamine but are treated, pre-treated with a control solution not containing the candidate drug, they move around vigorously and then they settle down. But if the candidate drug is present after the amphetamine injection, the mice don't move around so much.  

* So, this is certainly no proof that one has an anti-psychotic drug, but it's one of the steps that one might take. Now the other traces we won't discuss much, except to say that those are lower amphetamine levels, and they provide some control traces. There is a fair amount of experimental background for testing drugs for schizophrenia and in our next lecture we'll talk about those drugs.
