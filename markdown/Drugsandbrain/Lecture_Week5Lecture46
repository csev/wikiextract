An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 46 Bipolar Disorder. Heterozygote advantage  
* This is Throop Garden in the foreground and Millikan Library in the background. This scene appeared in several episodes of Numb3rs.  

* Hello. We're going to talk about a delicate and perhaps controversial topic. And this is the question of how it is that genes predisposing to bipolar disease have survived and even perhaps maintain their ratio in modern societies? And the answer may be that, a small disposition to bipolar behavior, a small disposition to manic behavior may be a selective advantage.  

**Heterozygote advantage?**  
* So let's go on and talk about the so-called heterozygote advantage. It is clear to many people that people with bipolar disorder are often fascinating in the early stages. Indeed, I have a psychiatrist friend who says that everybody needs to fall in love in his life with one bipolar person.  

* Bipolar people often receive favorable notice in high-functioning environments. And I'm now going to give you some observations by Kay Redfield Jamison about high-functioning environments that are primarily artistic ones. But I think these days, we are all more aware than previously of the possibility that bipolar disorder somewhere on the spectrum or a tendency to bipolar disorder is also prevalent in other high-functioning environments where people receive favorable notice for excellent achievements and this would include universities, corporate leadership, and government.  
* So in her book, Manic Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament, Kay Jamison gives an illustrative, rather than a comprehensive list of people who certainly suffered from a mood disorder, because their mood symptoms predated their other conditions.  

**Illustrative list from Jamison**
* But, when most of these artists and writers and composers, poets lived, there was no DSM-IV, there was not even DSM-III and there was no clear distinction between neurology and psychiatry and no way to talk about bipolar disease.  Certainly, no way to distinguish among bipolar I or II or III. But the list of highly creative people, artists, writers, composers, musicians, poets, artists, is really quite impressive. People whose success seemed to go along with a certain propensity toward mood, possibly bipolar behavior.  

**Vincent Van Gogh 1853-1890**  
* A good example of a person who showed traits of bipolar disorder would be, of course the painter Van Gogh. In his rather short life time, 37 years, he was vastly prolific with 750 paintings, 1600 drawings, 700 letters. He was born and raised in the Netherlands moved to Paris, where many artists lived at that period. In Arles, he was hospitalized after cutting off his own ear, an obvious manic state of one sort or another, and then two years later, he shot himself.  
* So, here is a progression of self-portraits of Van Gogh over this remarkable four-year period. Statements like this might seem hypomanic to us: “I'd like to do portraits which will appear as the, revelations to people in a 100 years’ time.”  

* Here is another self-portrait of himself with the bandage over the ear that he cut off, early 1889.  Here  are two remarkable portraits of his physician, Dr. Gachet. At the time, it was not possible to distinguish between neurologists and psychiatrists. Here is a more or less classical painting of Gachet. Here is one in Van Gogh's famous style of emphasized brush strokes. Gachet is pensive. He may be worried. The plant may have medicinal value, but I'm not sure which plant it is, and we can have some discussion about this.  

* And finally, one of van Gogh's most famous paintings, most experimental, just possibly his last one just before he shot himself. So, clearly highly creative behavior is along the mood disorder spectrum and along the bipolar spectrum in ways that we do not understand.
