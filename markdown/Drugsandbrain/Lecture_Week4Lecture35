An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 35 Parkinson’s Disease. Clinical picture; genetics

* Hello. The next few lectures we are going to be discussing Parkinson's Disease. This is an active and vibrant area in modern
research, especially on the translational front. We can't cover all aspects but, as usual I'm going to try to give you a flavor
of the research that may develop new drugs and new treatments for Parkinson's Disease.

**Slide>>Parkinson’s disease**

* As usual we will begin with the clinical picture and with the genetics and then in the following lectures, we will talk about pathophysiology, about bio-markers and non-human models for the disease. That there won't be a heterozygote advantage. And then we will talk about therapeutic approaches. Interestingly enough. For Parkinson's Disease, there are two therapeutic approaches being considered. One is symptomatic relief for people who clearly have the symptoms of Parkinsons and the other is protection against further degeneration.   
* The story begins with James Parkinson who was an apothecary surgeon. In 1817, he described in an essay, a paralysis agitans, an agitated paralysis. These were not patients of his. These were individuals he observed during his daily walks in London. The disease includes tremors at rest, three to five hertz (a hertz is a cycle per second). Also, a kind of pill rolling motion like this. Slow movements, particularly when starting, and short rapid steps. These days, however, most Parkinson's patients are either medicated or electrically stimulated, and so one does not see a complete set of Parkinsonian symptoms.

**Slide>>Excellent video of the large motor problems in a PD patient**  

* Here's an excellent Youtube video. This gait is the hypokinetic  gait the prototype is Parkinson's or Parkinsonian type of gait, in which the patient will have a posture which will be stooped over, lean forward, and then will have difficulty as far as initiating gait. When the gait is initiated, there are small steps. Often times, there's a tremor associated with this. And as the gait progresses there may be a picking up of speed or what's called a fenestrated gait, and then a turning. Instead of having the normal turning, the patient will turn  "en bloc", which means they'll turn, almost as a statue moving around and then again, having difficulty starting in the Marche à petits pas [{gait with little steps}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marche_a_petit_pas).  I apologize for not knowing the name of the wonderful expert who uploaded this video. But since he was wearing a microphone, he clearly wanted to be seen in public.

**Slide>>Dopaminergic neurons in the human brain: Saggital view**

* What happens in Parkinson's disease? Well, it has been known for nearly a century that a set of neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease. Here is a sagittal view of the brain from our recommended textbook Nessler. And in Parkinson's disease, the most dramatic death of neurons are the neurons that make dopamine; the dopaminergic neurons which die in the substantia nigra. Here in a mouse brain is a coronal view, and it is stained for tyrosine hydroxylase, one of the enzymes that helps to synthesize dopamine. Again, this is the so called handlebar mustache view. In which the handlebars of the mustache are the substantia nigra (literally black substance) and the upper lip is the ventral tegmental area. The ventral tegmental area does not degenerate in Parkinson's Disease to a large extent, but the substantia nigra does degenerate and it is the substantia nigra which controls motor functions.

**Slide>>Symptoms appear when “most” (50% -80%) SNc neurons are lost.**  

* In this diagram of the basal ganglia in mid brain and cortex we see a couple of feedback loops. A key element in this diagram is a feedback loop from the substantia nigra (SNc means literally substantia nigra pars compacta,  the part of the substantia nigra that is chock full of cell bodies. It projects to the striatum;  the striatum then projects back to the another part of the substantia nigra called the substantia nigra pars reticulata , the substantia nigra pars reticulata then also projects to the SNCE not shown here but it does and so we have a feedback loop in which various interruptions can cause oscillations and tremors.  
* There's another feedback loop from the substantia nigra pars reticulata to the thalamus, then to the cerebral cortex. And then back to the striatum as well as, although not shown here, back to the substantia nigra pars compacta . And this feedback loop apparently also is involved in the tremors of Parkinson's disease.  
* An important part is that symptoms occur in Parkinson's patients when they have lost most of their dopaminergic neurons. It used to be thought that you can see symptoms when patients have lost about 80% of their dopaminergic neurons but some clinicians say no; you can pick up symptoms of patients have lost only 50%. I should point out that most people lose dopaminergic neurons throughout their life. But Parkinson's patients have lost more, and earlier than other people. Now interestingly enough in many parts of the brain when a group of neurons degenerate, other neurons of the same sort which remain can pick up and form sprouts which partially compensate with new synapses for the loss. And this certainly occurs also in Parkinson's disease, which may account for the fact that patients need to lose a majority of their dopaminergic neurons before behavioral symptoms appear.

**Slide>>A hallmark of PD pathology: Intracellular “Lewy bodies”, especially in dopaminergic neurons**  
* Now in postmortem studies, one of the classic hallmarks of Parkinson's disease pathology, has been the so-called the Lewy bodies, discovered of course by Lewy. These occur especially in dopaminergic neurons. These are deposits of many types of proteins including we'll see later -synuclein. And so it has been used for many years (Lewy bodies) as a proxy for Parkinson's disease. But one must also remember that Lewy bodies also occur in other diseases, especially in some dementias.

**Slide>>PD patients often have additional symptoms and degeneration** 
* Parkinson's patients often have additional symptoms and other degenerations. Constipation is one of them. Detailed surveys show that most Parkinson's patients have constipation long before the clinical symptoms. I should hasten to add that Parkinson's is not predicted by constipation. Many, many people have constipation, but do not go on to develop Parkinson's Disease. Interestingly enough, intestinal biopsies, bits of tissue from the intestine, show Lewy bodies, in the neurons of the intestinal wall in patients with Parkinson's Disease. And, there are indeed many dopaminergic neurons, in the intestine.  
* A famous [staging paradigm by the great neuroanatomist Braak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braak_staging) shows that various neurons with long axons throughout the brain show Lewy bodies before dopaminergic neurons show Lewy bodies but there are fewer no symptoms due to these other neurons which show Lewy bodies. Parkinson's patients also showed sleep disorders especially in REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep). Many Parkinson's patients also have olfactory problems that is they have anosmia. Many Parkinson's patients develop depression as part of the disease and many also develop dementia. So one should see Parkinson's disease as primarily manifested in these motor symptoms that you've seen demonstrated. But there's also a constellation of other problems as well.

**Slide>>Genetics. Familial Parkinson’s disease provides a good review of biochemistry**

* Now, the genetics of Parkinson's Disease really provides a good review of basic biochemistry. I should point out that only 10% of patients clearly have a genetic form of Parkinson's disease and in these roughly 10% of patients with genetic Parkinson's disease;  the onset is in the 30s to the 50s, rarely earlier or later than that. And so 90% of Parkinson's patients are sporadic or have no known cause. But we'll get into that in future lecture.  
* And so, the Parkinson's researchers have systematized the genes in just calling them Park1  through however many have been discovered. I believe we are up to 16 now, the most famous gene that's defective in Parkinson's Disease is &alpha;-synuclein. And even among inherited Parkinson's Disease. Very few have &alpha;-synuclein mutations. The inheritance pattern for these mutations varies.  
* This is not of course in genetics, but inheritance can be chromosomal dominant, that is one needs only one defective copy of the gene. Autosomal recessive, one needs two copies, and then, even if the genes are present, one sometimes has incomplete penetrance. I will discuss this a bit more when we talk about mood disorders. So, some of the Parkin genes have unknown function, for instance Park3, there is a known function of &alpha;-synuclein, it seems to be membrane fusion in various organelles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi to endosomes and from synaptic vesicles to the surface membrane for instance.  
* The ubiquitin system is a well studied one in neuro-degenerative diseases. Basically, proteins accumulate when they shouldn't; there are kinases defective in Parkinson's disease. DJ-1 really has an unknown function. Next lecture we'll discuss several additional topics in Parkinson's Disease, including pathophysiology of the genes that we just mentioned.
