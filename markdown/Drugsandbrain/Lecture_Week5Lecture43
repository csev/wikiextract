An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 43 Major depression. Mechanisms of antidepressant action 

* We're beginning now to synthesize everything that we've learned in this course about drug action and about the natural physiology of cells and neuroscience. And we're trying to put together a coherent story, if we can, about how antidepressants act. We'll take two mini lectures to do this.

**Slide>> How does the SSRI-SERT Interaction relieve depression?**  
* How does the interaction between SSRIs and SERT relieve depression? Well, most experts would restate this question: How does blockade of serotonin re-uptake relieve depression via the presumed outside-in mechanisms.  

* In mini Lecture 21, for instance, we've recapitulated the outside-in pathways for gene activation downstream from G protein coupled receptors. There is also a serotonin-activated channel, the 5HT3 receptor.  

* And in discussions about nicotine action and nicotine addiction we've said that some ligand-gated channels are permeable to calcium. This could start second messenger pathways, either directly or indirectly. This seems unlikely for the 5-HT3 receptor. It's not very calcium permeable. But let's keep that in mind.  

* So, in general, then, the possible downstream consequences of changed regulation of serotonergic systems would be short term derangement of the modulation of synaptic strength and possibly also, neuronal intrinsic properties. How keeping this going for two to three weeks, produces the full effects of SSRI is not known.   

* And then there's the possibility that these changes in intracellular function could lead to long-term changes in neuronal gene expression. How these might take two to three weeks is also not known, but the possibility exists.  

* And there is also additional evidence for the action of serotonin and as we'll see norepinephrine systems in antidepressant action because the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO),  which are not used so frequently these days, primarily because of their side effects, clearly involve both serotonin and noradrenaline. Those are monoamines. And also, the tricyclic antidepressants, also not so commonly used anymore, act on many aspects of serotonin and noradrenergic systems. So there's a lot of involvement for serotonergic and noradernergic systems.  How?

**Slide>> SSRIs bind tightly to, and stabilize, intermediate state(s) of the serotonin transporter**
* Well, it is very clear that SSRIs bind to, and stabilize, intermediate states of the serotonin transporter. I've showed you this before {see Lecture 22 and 23}. And it is thought, at least at the beginning, that this blockade of serotonin uptake is what leads to the antidepressant actions.

**Slide>> To most experts, success of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)â€¦**
* And, indeed to most experts, the success of SSRIs and of the previous drugs that also work on the serotonin system, imply participation of serotonergic systems in the brain but non-specifically. You see, the problem is that there are about fifteen serotonin receptor genes, and scientists have not yet implicated one of these genes or one of these serotonin receptors, either presynaptically or postsynaptically, or two or three of them, as absolutely necessary and sufficient for the anti depressant action of SSRIs.  

* And instead the one serotonin associated protein that's common to all serotonin systems, the serotonin transporter, is the one that's been implicated. Now for any kind of reductionist approach, to further progress or for the intellectual curiosity of understanding how a drug acts. This is a real puzzle.

**Slide>> Non-cell-autonomous actions in SSRI antidepressant treatment**
* Well, some new data suggests the possibility that there are non-cell autonomous actions in SSRI anti-depression treatment. Of course that is actions that do not involve the cells that express the serotonin transporter themselves but also involve other secretions of the serotonergic cells in addition to the ultimate non cell autonomous effect which is that the concentration of serotonin gets increased throughout the nervous system.   

* So it is thought that a type of molecule is involved called a micro RNA. These are small RNA molecules which bind to messenger RNA and help to regulate protein synthesis. It is thought that in the native state. Micro RNA, helps to regulate the amount of SERT in particular, micro-RNA sixteen, also called miR16, and this may involve other transduction pathways.  

* And so one data set suggests that after SSRI antidepressant treatment there is a change in the amount of micro RNA made. Not clear how this comes about from fluoxetine binding to the serotonin transporter. This changes the amount of a neurotrophic factor released. The neurotrophic factor is called, for very interesting historical reasons, S100&beta; We have already talked about glial derived growth factor, and later in this and in next lectures, we will be talking about another growth factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor. So, it is thought then that the action of Fluoxetine leads to increase release of S100&beta;. And the Raphe and the locus coeruleus, that is the serotonin and the noradrenergic neurons are adjacent in the brain.  

* And so it's thought that possibly, S100&beta; acts on the miR16 noradrenergic neurons. This induces SERT, this induces sensitivity to fluoxetine in the noradrenergic neurons which previously had little or no concern. And this leads to serotonin being incorporated into the synaptic vesicles of the previously noradrenergic neurons. Additional trypotphan hydroxlase will be involved and this leads to release of serotonin by the previously noradrenergic neurons.  

* So this is an example of the ferment around the question of how antidepressants work. And a very interesting aspect of this topic is that it hints at an inside-out mechanism. Note that the fluoxetine here is drawn as though it enters the neuron, directly. What happens downstream from fluoxetine entering the neuron is not clear in the present data.

**Slide>> Postulated Role for Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in Depression & Therapy**
* There is a rather remarkable molecule called Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor, vastly important in the development of maintenance in the nervous system. And data over the past decade or so suggests that in the normal state of a neuron, for instance in the hippocampus or in the cortex, here we have the dendrite we have spines on the dendrite we've discussed them previously. The spines get excitatory synapses.  

* There are data clearly indicating that in the depressed state neurons have fewer spines, so pre-synaptic terminals in some cases lack spines to make synapses on. And there are further data suggesting that increased amounts of BDNF, Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor increases the number of spines and therefore increases the probability of having bona fide excitatory synaptic transmission. SSRIs then seem to enhance the expression of BDNF, either at the mRNA level and at the protein level, in fact at both levels. And so this might ameliorate some of the structural effects of major depression. Well, there are a few more theories, and we will treat that in the next lecture, as well.
