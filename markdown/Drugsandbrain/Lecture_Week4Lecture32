An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 32 Alzheimer's disease-Clinical description & genetics text  

* Here is another view of the Parson Gates building at Cal Tech. It was formerly the laboratory where Linus Pauling did a great deal of his work. It's now administrative and in numbers it's the hero's office building.  
* Hello. Welcome back to Drugs and the Brain. We've spent the first two, two and a half weeks of this course describing some very basic properties of the nervous system and the drugs that act on nerve cells. We spent, then, the third week discussing recreational drugs. And at the end of the third week, we put together all of our knowledge and talked about the disease, nicotine addiction, that is really based on taking drugs. For the next couple of weeks, we're going to talk about neural diseases, what we know about their causes. And how we can use drugs to help patients for neural diseases.

**Slide>> Alzheimer’s disease**
*  So let's get started with Alzheimer's disease. We're going to follow a general organization for all neural diseases and Alzheimer's disease will be our first. First we'll describe a clinical description of Alzheimer's disease and then what we know about its genetics, about its pathophysiology, what causes the disease, about bio markers and animal models and about a heterozygote advantage and we'll describe what we mean for that. Basically, none is known for Alzheimer's disease and we won't have a good example of a heterozygous advantage until we begin to talk about depression and bipolar disease.  
* And then of course, because this is a course in drugs and the brain, we're going to discuss therapeutic approaches. Now for each disease we will emphasize one or the other, depending on what is actually known about that disease and how much therapeutic progress has been made.

**Slide>> Symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease**
*  First of all the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease begins with what we might call a pure impairment of cognitive function. I should point out that what we call mild cognitive impairment does not always lead to dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia. The progression of Alzheimer, follows several stages.  
* The first symptom may be mild forgetfulness. And in this stage people have trouble remembering recent events or activities or the names of familiar people or things, may not be able to solve simple math problems. And, they may begin like a professor to repeat themselves every few minutes in conversation.  
* In the middle stages patients may forget how to do simple tasks like brushing their teeth or combing their hair and. They are no longer able to think clearly and they begin to have problems speaking, understanding, reading or writing.  
* In the late stage, Alzheimer's patients may become hard to manage. They may become aggressive or anxious and they may wander away from home and eventually they need total care. So that's the clinical picture in Alzheimer's Disease

**Slide>> Incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)**
* The incidence is worth describing. Alzheimer's disease or AD is the most common neurodegenerative brain disease. One estimate is that five million Americans and 25 million people globally now suffer from this disease.  
* The most important risk factor for Alzheimer disease across all populations is age. And so we see roughly a 2-fold increase in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease as people begin to get older than 65 every five years or so. So, at age 75 we have ten percent incidence. At age 80, it's 20 percent. At age 85, more than 30%. Despite this increasing incidence of Alzheimer disease, as people get older; it's not considered a normal part of aging. It is a Pathology. 
* The more common form of Alzheimer's is also known as late onset, or sporadic Alzheimer's disease. It is  certainly the most common, occurs fairly late in life, and there is no obvious, inheritance pattern. None the less, several genes may interact with each other to increase the risk of the disease. Certainly the most common risk factor gene identified so far for late onset Alzheimer's disease is a gene that makes one form of Apolipoprotein E or ApoE. The ApoE4 is the particular allele, the particular protein made. It's prevalence is 16% in the population and people with ApoE4, have a three to fold increase in Alzheimer's disease risk, even if they only have one ApoE4 allele.  
* Now we're going to spend a few moments talking about familial Alzheimer's disease or inherited Alzheimer's disease and it's much rarer and it also begins at an earlier age.

**Slide>> Anatomical Hallmark of Alzheimer’s Pathology**
* The anatomical hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology, known for about a century, are striking structures in the brain called amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A plaque, you can see why it's called that, and a tangle you can see why it's called that. The plaques contain large amounts of a 42 amino acid protein called &beta;-amyloid or simply A&beta;42.  
* We'll see in a few minutes, how it got that name. And in the next lecture, we're going to note the data amyloid itself may be the initial cause of the pathology that leads to dementia. This doesn't mean, that the amyloid plaque is the cause of the pathology. The pathology may be a lot earlier than that plaque. But the plaques and the tangles probably contribute to the later stages of the pathology.  
* So what about the tangles? Well, they are extremely rich in cytoskeletal proteins. And the one that, is best known as the microtubule associated protein called tau. And in the tangles, there are heavily phosphorylated proteins. You remember that we learned about phosphorylated proteins, in previous lectures. And it's possible that these cause aggregation and precipitation of the cytoskeleton. Again, it's not clear that these tangles, are what causes the disease.  
* And in general there is reduced brain volume. Especially in some regions of the brain that are quite important for cognition; the entorhinal cortex in the hippocampus. Now, I want you to appreciate that because one of the few tools we had up until a few decades ago was anatomy, it was easy to see these plaques and tangles but we can't conclude that they actually cause the disease.

**Slide>> presenilin 1 and APP mutations associated with familial AD**
* I want to tell you about another couple of genes that have mutations very closely associated with familial Alzheimer's Disease. One of the genes makes a protein called presenilin-1 and another of the genes makes APP or amyloid precursor protein. Presenilin-1 has many mutations shown here in red that are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease. So each of these red mutations, each of these red amino acids can be mutated.  And certain mutations then do cause Alzheimer disease. APP, we will talk about in a moment.  
* Presenilin is one is part of a large protein complex called &gamma;-secretase, which is a membrane associated protease. You'll remember that a Protease is an enzyme that cleaves other proteins.

**Slide>> There are “tauopathies” as well**
*  In addition to mutations in presenilin and in APP, there are also mutations in tau proteins that cause, dementia. They are called tauopathies. Literally, pathological features of tau and, some of these cause frontotemporal dementia with Parkinson's disease linked to chromosome 17. So this gives you an indication that there are lots of different types of dementia. Alzheimer's is the most common but, frontotemporal dementia is another type. Next time we will talk a little bit more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease, the pathophysiology.
