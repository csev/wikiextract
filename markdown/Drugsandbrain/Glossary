**[Penetrance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance)**
*  The penetrance of a disease-causing mutation is the proportion of individuals with the mutation who exhibit clinical symptoms.
> Example: The penetrance of schizophrenia among identical twins (genetically identical) is only 50%, not 100%. Thus, schizophrenia is partially penetrant. (as discussed in mini lecture 48)

**[phosphodiesterase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase)**

**Plasticity (Neural plasticity) or [Neuroplasticity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)**

* The long-term adaptations of neurons to the sustained short-term actions of a drug.  
> Example: The clinical effect of the SSRI class of antidepressants (such as fluoxetine and mirtazepine) has a delayed onset. This is probably because neural plasticity is the means by which these drugs improve the individual’s mood and functioning.  
> In healthy individuals neural plasticity is associated with learning and memory. Some disease conditions (such as chronic pain syndromes) may be caused by abnormal neural plasticity.  
> These changes may be brought about by phosphorylation of neuronal proteins and regulation of gene transcription or expression or by changes in synaptic function.

**Stochastic process**

* A random process.  A set of random values.  

>  Example: Once a ligand-gated ion channel opens, the duration of time it remains open before closing again is not pre-determined. The closing time varies for the same channel on consecutive openings, and also varies between channels of the same kind. The channel closing event, in this example, can be mathematically modelled as a stochastic process.
