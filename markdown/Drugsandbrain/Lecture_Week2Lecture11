An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 11 Dose-Response Relations  
* Hello, we'll begin by playing from the San Francisco Bay area where Coursera has its headquarters to the Cal Tech campus where drugs and the brain is being taught. In fact, we'll fly to the Kirchhoff building on the Cal Tech campus, where most of the drugs in the brain is recorded.  

**The concept of dose and response**  
* Now, we'll talk about dose-response relation. The concept of dose and response has intimate connections with the concept of receptors. And receptors and dose-response relations were defined more than a century ago and many decades before we knew about receptors as proteins in genes.  

* The general idea is that we can add drugs to an organism, or to an isolated part of an organism, or to a cell in many different ways that perhaps the most precise way of doing it is the molarity of the drug, its concentration and we can also express that in terms of grams per liter, grams per hour per kilogram of body weight if we're applying to an entire animal. We can talk in general terms about doses, such as the number of the injections, the number of pills, and other way of adding drugs to a system.  

* We can also talk about responses at a lot of levels of analysis. Here is a picture that I showed you a couple of lectures ago about various ways to study the nervous system, we can use all of those ways to study the responses to drugs, and in a more reductionist approach we can actually measure individual single channels in drug, in biological membranes. Unfortunately, we won't have a chance to discuss this in greater detail. Of course, not on here is the classical method of identifying the binding of a drug to its receptor, which is using a radioactively labeled drug or using a fluorescent drug.  

* And also above the level of analysis in this slide is the concept of behavior. We can measure the number of times an animal, or a person, presses a lever to get a reward, or the ambulation of that animal, or another aspect of the animal's cognitive behavior such as pressing a lever, in a very complex situation in order, again, to get a reward.  

* So these are doses, and these are responses and in it typical very general dose response relation, we have a relationship between the drug dose or the concentration and the response and in general when we have zero dose we have zero response and if we do have a baseline response well we're just looking at the increment above that baseline. And then when we add up dose or at a high enough concentration we begin to get terms that could be called under various terms no more no additional response. Sometimes we call this a saturation of the response, or a plateau, or a ceiling, or an asymptote, but in general after at some high level of concentration of drug we get no more response.  

* And so in this case, we can say that the drug is probably an agonist, because it is in fact eliciting a response. And the term agonist comes from the Greek word, to act, and so this is just a fancy way of saying, or an international way of saying that the drug is acting. Now we can of course do this, in a more general thing. Now let's talk about more general aspects of drug doses.  

**The “infinite sink” simplification**  
* Now let's discuss, the so called infinite sink simplification, in drugs and the brain. Receptor proteins are numerically scarce in and around cells compared with other protein molecules or with drug molecules in the solution around the receptors, and therefore drug concentrations are not markedly depleted by binding to receptors. Now this is very different from elementary chemistry in which one has two reactants reacting with each another, and both of them are depleted by the reaction.  

* Another way of saying this is that drugs remain at constant concentration near receptors. At least on a time scale of seconds to minutes and the distant scale of micrometers. Now on a longer time scale, of course, the body metabolizes drugs in various organs on a time scale of hours to days. And on a larger length scale we discussed the blood-brain barrier, and we've discussed permeation into various organs. But on the time scale we're discussing here, we can say that drugs remain at a constant concentration, near receptors.  

* Therefore, we can use pseudo first order kinetics, at least from the viewpoint of a receptor, to describe the drug binding. If we have a drug, D, plus a receptor, R, we get a drug-receptor complex. Now, as we'll see, this drug-receptor complex is not what we measure. We measure some downstream consequences of it, usually. But the differential equation for this process is that the rate of change of the drug receptor complex is equal to a forward binding rate times the concentration of drug times the concentration of receptor, minus an unbinding rate times the concentration of the drug receptor complex. And the key here is that indeed the drug concentration is a constant not depleted by binding. 

**Excel dose-response demonstration**  
* With that in mind let's go to a typical drug receptor modeling scheme. And here's an Excel file which you can access at Coursera for a more formal analysis of dose response relations. Now we have a concentration of agonist and a response. We won't say specifically what response we're using but it could for instance, be a number of open channels, or the activation of G-protein pathway, etc, everything on that first slide.  

* We have linear coordinates in the graph on the left with the yellow background. And we have logarithmic agonist concentration coordinates in the graph on the right. Lets open it up just a little bit and I'll show you this { the x-axis of the logarithmic dose-response relationship graph} runs from one to a 100,000, and we're using for example nanomolars in this hypothetical reaction. So we have a couple of parameters that we can adjust.  

* We have the EC50, this is the half maximal concentration of the drug, we have the efficacy of the drug and the Hill coefficient. Let’s see what happens when we make the drug receptor interaction weaker, we’ll change the EC-50 from twenty nanomolar to a 100 nanomolar. But here on the linear scale the response reaches half maximal only toward the end of the range. And here on the log scale, again, the response is half maximal on the EC50. Let's go back to twenty nanomolar for the EC50, and let's go to this very important concept of the Hill coefficient.  

* Now, the Hill coefficient basically describes how cooperative the dose response relation looks. On linear coordinates, we have more or less a rectangular hyperbola. Here we have a linear start and a gradual saturation. On logarithmic coordinates in agonist we have a different form, in which there does seem to be a sigmoid plot.  

* Let’s see what happens when we make the Hill coefficient two. Now what this basically says is that the active state of the receptor is more likely to be associated with the presence of two bound agonist molecules than with the presence of a single bound agonist molecule. And for receptors like channels which are pseudo-symmetric multimers as we've seen, it often does take more than one bound agonist molecule to activate that receptor. So we'll press return and now have a sigmoid start, a parabolic start to the dose response relation looks a little bit like a parabola, and indeed if we blow it up we'll see that it has it's perfect square law response as long as we stay at a very small agonist concentration. And the logarithmic dose response relation has become a bit sharper.  

* Now, another key concept is the efficacy. We're assuming here that every receptor molecule that binds an agonist produces a response but if we change this so called efficacy to only half, then the maximum of the dose response relation never gets bigger than half on either coordinate. So these are examples of dose response relations involving the concepts of EC50, of efficacy, and of Hill coefficient. Of course, the Hill coefficient is named after A.V. Hill, the great British physiologist. So, let’s go back to one for efficacy.  

**Concepts in dose-response relations**  

* We will now say in general that if we look at the dose response relations again we have the input parameters.  Here's the full hill equation that we've used. Here is the efficacy (F). Here is the concentration of agonist (A), the EC50, and (n sub H) is the hill coefficient. And so we have the dose response relation on linear plots here in light yellow, and on semi-log plots for the agonist in this light red. And the maximal response decreases as the efficacy of the agonist decreases. That is for efficacies less than one, the agonist is a partial agonist. 

* And again, for Hill coefficients there is somewhat of a difference between a Hill coefficient and cooperativity. Cooperativity indicates that after the first agonist is bound, the second is more likely to bind. And that is involving concepts of shape shifting proteins such as we talked about earlier. The statement that we made about the Hill coefficient is rather more general than that. And here it is repeated: { If n sub Hill = 2, the active state of the receptor is more likely to be associated with the presence of two bound agonist molecules than with a single bound agonist}. 

**Examples of Drug Classes**  

* So, let's look at examples of drug classes.  If we have a efficacy of one, we have a full agonist. And here's an example: Nicotine at nicotinic receptors is a rather full agonist. At most, at some nicotinic receptors in the brain.  

* An example of a partial agonist, whose efficacy is between zero and one, would be varenicline, the drug used for smoking cessation. It also binds to nicotinic receptors. And it's thought that binding to nicotinic receptors but not activating them fully allows varenicline to out-compete nicotine, and to give just enough of a feeling of well-being but not a full activation to help a smoker stop smoking.  

* Obviously as the efficacy drops more and more, the ligand sits on the receptor, and does not allow the conformational change, that actually activates the receptor. And that becomes an antagonist, against an agonist. An example of an antagonist, switching to another class of drugs is fluoxetine, which is an excellent, high affinity antagonist for the serotonin transporter.  

* Then we have inverse agonists which actually shift the receptors into a conformation that is not simply inactive, but does not allow the agonist to bind at all (so a different shape in entirely). And so an example of a partial inverse agonist is clozapine, the anti-psychotic drug at 5-HT2 receptors.  

*And finally there are full inverse agonists, which act even more to keep the receptor in a closed confirmation, different from the inert confirmation. And this would be &beta;-carboline which acts on GABA A receptors. And we'll discuss GABA A receptors in a little while.
