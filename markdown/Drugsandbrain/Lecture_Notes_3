# Drugs Bind to [Neurotransmitter Transporters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_transporter) (22)

**Serotonin pathways in the brain**
* [Raphe nuclei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphe_nuclei) release serotonin to the rest of the brain.
* Raphe nuclei are in two systems
  - Rostral and Caudal
* Serotonergic means "related to the neurotransmitter serotonin".

**3 classes of proteins transport ions across membranes**
* Passive Transport
  - Channel Proteins  
  - Ion Coupled Transporter (play a major role in neurotransmitter transport)  
* Active transport
  - requires energy from ATP  
  - Ion Pumps (also important in neurotransmitter transport) 

**Plasma Membrane neurotransmitter transport into cell** 
* ATP driven Sodium pump increases Sodium concentration in cell
* Sodium (Na+) coupled neurotransmitter transporter
  (Sodium ions flow out of cell, neurotransmitter flows into cell
* Process can be reversed
* Performs two major functions 
<ol>
<li>Terminate action of Neurotransmitter</li>
<li>Replenish neurotransmitter in presynaptic terminal of neuron</li>
</ol>

**Vesicle transport** 
* gets neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles (SV)
* ATP driven Proton pump increases protons within SV
* proton coupled neurotransmitter transporter
  (Protons flow out of SV, neurotransmitter flows into SV
* Process can be reversed 

**MDMA or Amphetamines Release Transmitter into the External Medium**
* inhibits uptake of dopamine into presynaptic terminal
* causes release of dopamine (DA) from presynaptic terminals

**Method to detect dopamine**
* Carbon-ﬁber electrodes can be used to make sensitive current measurements
* This method is called Cyclic voltammetry

**Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockout mice experiment**
* Experiment to determine effect of amphetamine on normal mice and mice that lack dopamine transporter
* DAT knockout means deletion of a gene that expresses dopamine trasnporter protein
* Normal mice: after release of amphetamine there is a gradual increase of extracellular dopamine
* DAT knockout mice: after release of amphetamine; no change in extracellular dopamine   

**Sodium (Na+) coupled cell membrane neurotransmitter transporter major targets for drugs of therapy and abuse** 
* serotonin transporter 
- Antidepressants (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI)  
- Recreational drug: MDMA 
* dopamine transporter
- Attention-deficit disorder (amphetamine)  
- Recreational drug: cocaine, amphetamines

# Neurotransmitter Transporters as Molecules (23)
* discussion of neurotransmitter transporter as proteins
* counting neurotransmitter transporter  

**“Alternating Access” Model for ion-coupled transporters**
* How do ion coupled transporters work?
* Move an ion and a small molecule
* transporter protein "cycles" between two conformations which moves molecules between two compartments
* symport moves molecules to the same compartment
* antiport moves molecules to opposite compartments


**Fluoxetine Bound to LeuT, a Bacterial Homologue of Neurotransmitter Transporters**
* the bacterial protein shown is a transporter that is analogous to neurotransmitter transporter 
* it is a static view, not dynamic

**[SSRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) bind tightly to, and stabilize, intermediate state(s) of the serotonin transporter**
* The experiment describes the dynamics of the “Alternating Access” Model
* ion-coupled transporters behave like ion channel with gates on either end
* Sodium, potassium and chloride ions can be used
* Sometimes both gates can be stuck open - like an ion channel
* [SSRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor)get the transporter "stuck", preventing it from functioning

**The GAT1 inhibitor, tiagabine, is used for epilepsy.**
* one type GABA transporter is caled GAT1 
* tiagabine slows GAT1 transport of GABA, which prolongs lifetime of GABA, allows GABA inhibition to increase, decreasing neuron firing
* developed method to count GAT1

**[cerebellum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum), rich in GABA inhibition**
* Looked at molecular layer, [Purkinje cell layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell), and [granule cell layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_cell_(cerebellum))


**How to localize and quantify GABA transporters**
* Take the gene of GABA transporter and append [green fluorescent protein (GFP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein)
* the protein expressed is a GABA transporter that fluoresces green and can be counted


**Brain of GABA Transporter-GFP ‘Knock-in” Mouse**
* need to make a strain of mice with the gene that has GABA transporter with GFP
* called a knock-in because a gene has been added
* GABA transporter with GFP expressed throughout mouse brain

**GAT1-GFP expression in cerebellum**
* The highest density (most green) region of the cerebellum is at junction of basket cells and Purkinje cell layer
* this is the pinceaux region
* at the molecular level, there are about 1000 GABA transporter per square micron
* An example of how neuroscientists study the targets for drugs

# Recreational  Drugs: Overview (24)
* Apply what we learn to certain key classes of drug action

**Recreational drugs**
* Recreational drugs are not equal to addictive drugs are not equal to abused drugs are not equal to illegal drugs
* but there is some overlaps
* We will study a constellation of nine drugs, mostly low molecular weight
* [morphine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine), [tetrahydrocannabinol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol), [ethanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol)  
* [caffeine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine), [phencyclidine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine), [LSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD)  
* [nicotine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine), [cocaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine), [amphetamine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine)

**Sources of recreational drugs**
* Most come from plants
* Drugs protected plants from herbivores

**Cocaine in the test tube and Mechanisms of entry, exemplified by cocaine**
* Cocaine base is uncharged (free base or crack) which permeates membranes
* Cocaine is reprotonated, the charged form in the brain acts on the dopamine transporter

**Routes into the body**
* The various routes include eating/drinking, inhaling, smoking, and injecting
* The best routes depend on the chemistry of the molecule.

# Targets (25)

**Targets for Recreational Drugs**

**Knockout mice and one application for them**

**Knockout mice in pharmacology**

**Most recreational drugs act at low active concentration**
* 10 nM (very low active concentration) 
- LSD
* 1 uM (low active concentration)- this is 100 x LSD 
-morphine-heroin, tetrahydrocannabinol, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine & derivatives, phencyclidine
* 10 uM active concentration - this is 1,000 x LSD  
- caffeine
* 1 mM (higher active concentration) - this is 100,000 x LSD
- ethanol
