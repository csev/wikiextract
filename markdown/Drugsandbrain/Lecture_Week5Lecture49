An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 49 Schizophrenia Pathophysiology.  A Century of Frustration..
* Hello, this mini lecture is entitled Schizophrenia Pathophysiology, A Century of Frustration. Because as you'll see, history shows that we do not yet have an idea about what causes schizophrenia.  

**Pathophysiology**  
* In fact, over the past century, each advance in biology and technology has been tried out on schizophrenia. Schizophrenia has become a kind of touch stone for neuroscience. Are we there yet? Do we have an explanation for schizophrenia?  

* Early in the twentieth century the great German scientists followed their passion for classifying, in this case, mental disorders. And in, in the 30s' the Nazi's had the idea that the Aryan race was a pure one and that to the extent that other genes got mixed up in the Aryan genes, there would be mental illness.  

* As a reaction, in part, to this totally genetic view of schizophrenia, American psychiatrists formulated the so-called schizogenic mother hypothesis, in which it was all environmental. And the behavior of the mother led a child to have schizophrenia. This was at about the same time that Bettelheim was developing the so-called “refrigerator mother” hypothesis of autism, since roundly rejected.  

* In the 1950s, the great Caltech chemist Linus Pauling was developing the idea that sickle cell anemia, a monogenic disease is caused by a change at a single amino acid in a protein sequence. That was remarkable at the time and Pauling, who was quite audacious, had the idea that perhaps all diseases were caused by molecules. In 1968, he published a paper entitled Orthomolecular Psychiatry in which he explained how all psychiatric diseases might be caused by the small molecules. So, that was his idea and he applied the most advanced technique available at that time to that idea.  

* And this most advanced technique available was paper chromatography. You remember those experiments in high school where you took a bit of filter paper or a paper towel, and you stuck it in an inkwell, and the ink got separated into its different components which climbed up the paper. Well, that was the advanced technique that Linus Pauling used to figure out whether schizophrenics had a molecule that was not there in the urine of normal patients or vice versa. He found nothing but the key idea that you applied the best technique you had at the time continues.  

* In 1955, when chlorpromazine was accidentally discovered as an antipsychotic, this had two results. First of all, it became possible to release from mental institutions, those patients who had been living in mental institutions. As you can see on this graph, the population of US mental institutions was increasing from the early 1800's till around 1955, and was a more or less constant ratio of the U.S. population. The same was probably true in the other advanced countries but, the advent of chlorpromazine allowed people to suppress the positive psychotic symptoms and to lead better lives. And so, the policy decision then was to release people from the mental institutions and allow them to live independently.  

* At the same time, it became evident that chlorpromazine acted on dopamine D2 receptors, more about this in a moment. And so, that gave rise to the theory that there was a deficit or a surfeit of dopamine synaptic transmission in the brain. So, the most advanced idea at the time applied to schizophrenia still around, still difficult to prove or disprove.  

* In the 70s' when neuroscientists learned that glutamate is a synaptic transmitter, it became evident to suggest that a particular type, one or the other of glutamatergic transmission was defective in schizophrenia.  

* In the 90s,' when we learned more about growth factors and development and migration and understood that schizophrenia typically sets on in the late teens, then it became possible to think about schizophrenia as primarily a developmental disease. One in which growth factors do not correctly control migration of neurons and this idea persists and is being developed at the present.  

* Around the turn of the millennium, when genetics and genomics became powerful enough to have lots of sequence,  we return to the idea of trying to find schizophrenia susceptibility genes. And this idea persists also to the present.  

* In the early 2000, when it became clear that interneurons were diverse in many ways, it became possible to suggest that only a single type of interneuron is defective in schizophrenia. That idea is being pursued today as well.   

* At about the same time, when innate immunity and other aspects of the inflammation became fairly well described,  a bunch of threads came together to suggest that schizophrenics either had a damaged immune system because of a prenatal trauma, or had a lower level, constant inflammation as late stage teenagers or adults. And this important area of pursuit remains.  

* I have made a minor contribution recently by suggesting that early exocytotic pathways may be defective in schizophrenic patients, that is the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. This is a paper in Biological Psychiatry 2012, sorry, it's hidden here.  

* But, in fact, there is no satisfactory explanation yet for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia and research on schizophrenia has taught us a great deal about neuroscience, but we don't yet have a satisfactory explanation. Except that we say that modern theories of schizophrenia emphasize abnormal balance among neuronal circuits or pathways.  

**Gross neuroanatomical abnormalities in schizophrenia**  
* And indeed, one can see many abnormalities in the brains of schizophrenics and it needs to be done with identical twins because there are variations in ventricle size among normal people. But when one looks at identical twins and averages, it's pretty clear that the identical twin who has schizophrenia has larger ventricles, more fluid space in the brain than the twin who does not. And this enlargement seems to be stable for several years.  

* Now, the probable reason that the ventricle is larger is that parts of the brain are smaller, in particular, decreased gray matter in the cortex, neurons and their processes. And this decreased gray matter in the cortex is found in certain areas, and so the ventricles have expanded to take up those areas. This decreased gray matter may, in some cases, be a result of drug treatment, but it is also present in first episode, never medicated patients.  
* Now, it's important to point out that neurodegeneration also involves decreased gray matter because neurons die. But in schizophrenia, there's only a modest loss of neurons. Instead, it looks as though the volume of each individual neuron and its processes is smaller.  


  
**Cellular neuronal abnormalities in schizophrenia (not shown here)**  
* There are abnormalities at the cellular level in studies of monozygotic twins, again, a favorite subject for schizophrenia research,  Activity relationships show that the prefrontal cortex has less activity as measured by SPECT, and you can review this topic from mini lecture 36 or as imaged by Positron Emission Tomography, PET. So, there are overall changes in activity and I'll get to those in the next slide as well.  

* There also seem to be changes at the level of sub-cellular structure. Here is a typical part of two dendrites from the cortex of a brain of a normal person at post mortem. You can see lots of spines presumably with lots of synapses on them. In these two schizophrenic brains, the dendrites are about the same diameter but they have many fewer spines. And this seems to be a reproducible finding.  


**Neuronal activity occurs during hallucinations (fMRI measurements, mL 26)**  
* Now, when a person is having hallucinations in schizophrenia, it is indeed possible to measure changes in brain activity especially in the auditory cortex, which would be appropriate for hallucinations. This is mostly done using, these days, using fMRI which we review in mini lecture 26.  

* So actually, when a person is having hallucinations, there is a neuronal activity correlate which is measurable, telling us, yes, that person actually does have the increased neuronal activity during the hallucination.  
 
**Known developmental activities of neuregulins (NRGs) fit with some pathophysiological hypotheses about schizophrenia**  
* Now, we have mentioned the neuregulins and the fact that neuregulins are mutant in some schizophrenic patients. In fact, the known developmental activities of neuregulins do fit with some pathophysiological hypotheses about schizophrenia.   

* So, neuregulins are important controls of the migration of neurons early on in life; of axon guidance, when axons do or do not get to their proper destination; of myelination of neurons, following up the theme of glia;  the oligodendrocytes which are going to be in sheathing the axons have some developmental anomalies if neuregulins are not there.   
* As mentioned previously, neuregulins help to form the neuromuscular junction, the nerve muscle synapse. And also, neuregulins help to form the spines and dendrites which as we have seen in a previous slide, seemed to be abnormal in schizophrenics.  

 
**Neuregulins also have acute effects on synaptic transmission, fitting with other pathophysiological ideas about schizophrenia**
* Neuregulins also seem to participate in some acute actions on synaptic transmission, and this fits with other pathophysiological ideas about schizophrenia.  
* So, for instance, the message carried by neuregulins is received in part by a molecule called ErbB4 which is a tyrosine kinase neuregulin receptor. We've learned about kinases before. We've learned about phosphorylating serine, and threonine, and tyrosine.  
* And ErbB4, which is one of the tyrosine kinase neuregulin receptors, is also mutated in some schizophrenics. And so, here is a diagram of a typical cortical microcircuit. We have the glutametgergic pyramidial cell at the center, we have three types of GABAergic inter neurons inhibiting various portions of the pyramidal cell. We have ErbB4 on all of the cell types. And the thinking then is that the neuregulin, which is always present, is maintaining the synaptic transmission at several key points in a microcircuit in the cortex that may go awry in schizophrenia.  

* So, in general, we have lots of pathophysiological hypotheses to think about in schizophrenia. But, none yet have been very clearly identified as causing schizophrenia.
