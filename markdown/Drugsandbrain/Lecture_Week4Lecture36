An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 36 Parkinson’s Disease. Pathophysiology; non-human models  

* Hello. In this lecture we're going to talk about Parkinson's Disease specifically pathophysiology in non-human models for the disease.

**Slide>>Parkinson’s disease: pathophysiology**  
* First of all we have to say explicitly that most cases of Parkinson's Disease have an unexplained cause. In general. People suspect that dopaminergic neurons may be selectively vulnerable because the cell body of the dopaminergic neuron must maintain large amounts of axoplasm and presynaptic proteins.  
* Here is the cell body and as you know it projects to many areas of the central nervous system, many parts of the brain. And so it is maintaining an enormous amount of cytosol in its axon and at its axon terminals, and this puts a tremendous burden on the cell body, which must then be maintained for many decades of life. Specifically, dopaminergic neurons may also be selectively vulnerable. Now, of course there are many types of neurons that have large axons. And, in fact, there are neurode-, degenerative diseases that correspond to most of them.  
* The motor neuron in the spinal cord is susceptible to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis which we will not have a chance to discuss in this course. The large Purkinje cell of the cerebellum degenerates in some ataxias. And as we've mentioned the large cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain can degenerate in Alzheimer's disease. Why each of these is selectively vulnerable in a certain disease is not understood.  
* Dopaminergic neurons may be selectively vulnerable in some cases because dopamine is highly reactive. Here are these two adjacent hydroxyl groups, a catechol group, and they are selectively accessible to oxidizing agents, and they then form reactive oxygen species themselves. And so, over a period of decades and decades, one has a build up of reactive oxygen species inside neurons.  
* Another cause of Parkinson's disease seems to be pesticides. There's a very nice paper by my friends at UCLA on pesticides in the central valley of California in people who are selectively exposed to those pesticides who have a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease.  
* And then there is the frozen addict episode several decades ago in the San Francisco Bay area. There was an impurity in synthetic heroin which was taken up by the dopamine transporter. As you'll remember, the dopamine transporter is expressed only in dopaminergic cells. This impurity was changed to another compound, and it killed dopaminergic neurons quite drastically.  
* Even before then, the influenza pandemic, worldwide epidemic of 1918, killed 20,000,000 people. In many people, the flu specifically killed dopaminergic neurons. Some of the survivors of that epidemic lived through the 60's and they were studied when Oliver Sacks was a young doctor in The Bronx, I believe, and that was the story of his book called "Awakenings" and of the film based on that story. He has gone on to write many wonderful books at the intersection of neuroscience and medicine.

**Slide>>&alpha;-synuclein has an unknown function**  
* What about the proteins that seem to be defective in Parkinson's Disease? Well, the best known is &alpha;-synuclein. It has an unknown function, although as I told you it seems to be involved in the trafficking and fusion of membranes especially in organelles.  
* An interesting aspect of &alpha;-synuclein is that it's an intrinsically disordered protein. That is when, studied on its own it doesn't seem to have a well described shape of &alpha;-helices and &beta;-sheets. It seems to be disordered. And mutant &alpha;-synuclein forms fibrils, so here is the monomer natively unfolded, a bit of a tendency to cause a fibril along extended protein and then we get an amyloid like fibril and then it is possible that these mutant synuclein can condense into Lewy bodies. The fact that the protein is increasingly disordered does not mean that is always disordered apparently &alpha;-synuclein can become ordered but only when it binds to certain other proteins, so its binding to other proteins which order synuclein.  
* Interestingly enough, there are some data suggesting that &alpha;-synuclein can be transmitted among the cells. The hypothesis has arisen that it can be transmitted like a prion so that an improperly folded state in cell A could be transmitted to improper folding in cell B. We'll have to see how this field of research plays out.  
* Another major theme in Parkinson's research is improper mitochondria function. This large cell body, which must maintain massive amounts of axoplasm and also large dendrites places severe metabolic burdens on the axoplasm and the most metabolically active organelles, the mitochondria and so, early mitochondrial function may be one of the causing agents in Parkinson's disease.

**Slide>>Animal Models for Parkinson’s Disease: Drosophila that overexpress synuclein**  
* Now to study all of these problems, there are animal models for Parkinson's disease. Among the earliest animal model was drosophila, fruit flies which over express synuclein. And here is an example of four dopaminergic neurons, which when they are over expressing synuclein, especially one of the synuclein mutants that are associated with human Parkinson's Disease, these neurons begin to degenerate. While they're degenerating they also show dense structures, which are like Lewy bodies, and indeed the flies show a movement disorder. Here is a measure of the climbing ability, very much like the experiment that Seymour Benzer did with the flies climbing up the side of a test tube, that control flies retain this ability until they're about a month old. But the flies which have been induced to express either wild type synuclein, or especially one of the human mutant synuclein, lose this ability to climb at a much earlier age. So the flies have a movement disorder.

**Slide>>More Models for Parkinson’s Disease**  
* There are more models for Parkinson's Disease. Because of the toxin angle, there are toxin treated mice, and rats, and monkeys, which have parkinsonian-like tremors and movement disorders. There are a number of mice whose park genes have been altered. In my laboratory we're working on one with &alpha;-synuclein, and these show varying degrees of movement disorders and Parkinson-like symptoms.  
* Interestingly enough it's been possible to show pathology in yeast. That have been induced to express &alpha;-synuclein from humans. These do not ordinarily express &alpha;-synuclein, but when they are forced to over-express synuclein and in particular mutant synuclein, they show defects and cellular stress that have also been associated with Parkinson's disease.  
* And then of course there is the question of whether one can culture cells from people carrying Parkinson's disease mutations, disease in a dish, if you will, and begin to study some of the most basic processes out of contact with other cells that might have extraneous influences. Disease in a dish is a very powerful concept in modern science and especially in neuroscience because, the brain is so complex, it's a great challenge to study the characteristics of the individual cells in the brain.  
* The two ways that scientists are approaching this use either human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) but this is not a course in stem cells or regenerative biology. But the major challenge would be to take cells from a person known to be at risk for Parkinson's Disease and to perform experiments on these cells in a sustained and rigorous manner and if for instance there are embryonic stem cells that have one of the mutations for Parkinson's disease this would be an excellent preparation.  
* A somewhat more foreseeable way to get these cells would be from skin cells from humans who have Parkinson's Disease with or without one of the defined mutations. To induce these skin cells, so called fibroblasts to go back to being stem cells. And then to induce these stem cells to become dopaminergic neurons.  
* Now there are still major technical issues in generating dopaminergic neurons that behave like vulnerable neurons, either from stem cells, or from induced pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent means able to differentiate into any other cell type. What is required are a number of growth factors in the cell culture medium, and these are maintained for at least a month. And neurons then begin to show some characteristics that suggest that they are dopaminergic.  Of course, what you would really like to do is to distinguish between neurons that look as though  they are substantia nigra pars compacta, the vulnerable ones versus the ventral tegmental area, the non-vulnerable ones. Experiments of this sort are just beginning based on markers, genes that are expressed by one or the other of these dopaminergic populations.  
* And then of course it's not enough simply to say that a cell has epitopes, molecules that can be addressed by antibodies for the classical enzymes such as tyrosine hydroxylase because cells that make dopamine and cells that extend their axons to many regions of the brain have a very large number of specific characteristics that are not shared by other neurons. And of course one asks which of those characteristics render them typically vulnerable to Parkinson's disease and how does the vulnerability progress?  So, disease in a dish is an exciting set of opportunities but, we need a lot more research.

**Slide>>Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease**
* What about biomarkers for Parkinson's disease? Well, there is no effective blood test for Parkinson's. So an experienced neurologist is still the best judge of whether or not a patient has Parkinson's disease. An excellent criterion used by many neurologist's is responsiveness to L-Dopa. If a person is able to move better, then that is a good indication that he has Parkinson's.  
* Recently an imaging reagent has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, it's called ioflupane. It's a high affinity dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand and it's been labeled with iodine 125 which is an excellent marker for single photon emission computed tomography or SPECT. So, in general neurons that are dopaminergic and alive and healthy express lots of the dopamine transporter as we had described in the previous lecture in order to take up the dopamine that's been released and to package it into vesicles again. Neurons that have died past the point that they can sprout more dopaminergic terminals have less of the dopamine transporter and here are images using the iodinated probe from a normal striatum. These are SPECT images, this would be a lot less extensive in a patient with Parkinson's Disease. So one of the major uses for ioflupane would be to differentiate symptoms that are Parkinsonian but may not be Parkinson's Disease. You may remember in the video during our last lecture that the presumed neurologist was very careful to say that this was a parkinsonian patient with symptoms as in Parkinson's Disease.  
* So you really do need post mortem material to show that a person has Parkinson's Disease. There are lots of behavioral symptoms that are called Parkinsonian that may not arise from deterioration of dopaminergic neurons, so one way to make that distinction is to use this iodinated ligand and for instance this might be able to differentiate Parkinson's disease from other symptoms such as essential tremor. And then we have to admit ioflupane has not yet become effective as a screening or confirmatory test or for monitoring disease progression, or for monitoring response to therapy. And this is one of the major uses we can make for an imaging reagent. It would be to monitor either, protection in the long run or symptomatic relief in the short run. And that of course will be the twin topics of our following lectures: symptomatic relief in the short run and protection in the long run.
