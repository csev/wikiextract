An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 37 Parkinson’s Disease. Therapeutic approaches: symptom relief  

* It's a late fall day at the Athenaeum in Pasadena, California. We're looking at the Einstein balcony, where Einstein used to enjoy looking at Caltech during his visits to the campus. Hello, this lecture is about Parkinson's Disease. Mostly about therapeutic approaches that reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. In a final lecture, we will then talk about stopping the degeneration of Parkinson's Disease.

**Slide>>Heterozygote advantage: none known**   
* First as warned, when we discuss psychiatric diseases, we'll talk a bit about advantages in carrying just one gene for the disease, as opposed to two. That's the so-called heterozygote advantage. There is none known for Parkinson's disease. Indeed, as you will remember, some Parkinson's mutations are dominant. One copy of the diseased gene is enough to cause the disease.

**Slide>>levodopa**  
* So we'll talk about symptomatic relief and of course the major agent for symptomatic relief has been in use for about four decades. It's L-dopa and here is its structure. It is a zwitterion, not neutral by itself, but has a balanced positive and negative charge. It penetrates into the brain via a transporter. Dopamine itself does not penetrate into the brain. Once in the brain, L-dopa, it is a substrate for an enzyme called a decarboxylase and the carboxyl group is removed by that enzyme and we have dopamine.  
* Now in order to get maximal effectiveness and minimal side effects in the peripheral nervous system L-dopa is usually mixed with carbidopa, which inhibits decarboxylases. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, and it therefore prevents hydrolysis in the blood and in the peripheral nervous system, and so we don't get peripheral effects of dopamine. In addition, Parkinson's patients also take D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine. This seems to reduce the dyskinesias, which I'm going to talk about on the next slide.

**Slide>>Side effects of L-dopa**  
* L-dopa of course remains effective only as long as sufficient dopaminergic neurons remain to take up the dopamine through their dopamine transporter to concentrate it and then to liberate it into the extracellular space where it can act on receptors. So, when a patient loses too many dopaminergic neurones, despite the fact that the dopaminergic neurons sprout as well as they can, ultimately L-dopa becomes ineffective.  
* In addition, there are side effects, of prolonged use of L-dopa. There are dyskinesias, so called bad movements literally, which are very common in people, who've used L-dopa for many years. In such dyskinesias, jerking movements, uncontrolled, very different from the hesitant slow shuffling movements in an unmedicated Parkinson's patient which you saw in a previous video, these dyskinesias are very common in public appearances of medicated Parkinson's disease patients. The mechanism by which L-dopa cause dyskinesias, is basically unknown. We all assume that it's an outside in mechanism, in which continued activation of Gi coupled pathways, ultimately leads to changes in protein synthesis which are only slowly reversed when the medication is discontinued. But that's really just a hypothesis, that it's an outside in mechanism.  
* In addition, the side effects include visual hallucinations, other psychotic symptoms, sleep disturbances, and confusion in patients who take L-dopa. There's also a so-called on-off phenomenon. Abrupt transient fluctuations in the severity of Parkinsonism. So note here we're using Parkinsonism in terms of the movement disorder to distinguish it as a cluster of symptoms rather than as the disease. So these fluctuations occur at intervals throughout the day, not related to the acute dosing of L-dopa. And so what exactly causes the on-off phenomenon remains a mystery among the side effects of L-dopa.

**Slide>>Other drugs for relief of PD symptoms**  
* Our recommended text book by Nessler and colleagues does a very good job of describing drugs that are occasionally used for relieving Parkinson’s disease symptoms among patients. The monoamine oxidase or MAO Type B inhibitors are useful because they prevent dopamine from being destroyed after it's been released into the extracellular medium. And there they prolong the action of dopamine in those dopaminergic neurons that still remain. Apparently, MAOB inhibitors have been used successfully for managing Parkinson’s disease in some patients.  
* Physicians also use muscarinic antagonists. You remember the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a  G-protein coupled receptor. It may help the action of certain key interneurons, GABAergic neurons in the striatum.  And it's not abundantly clear how this affect the symptoms of Parkinson's disease directly.  
* Some people use Amantadine for Parkinson’s disease. Amantadine blocks NMDA receptors which as you'll remember are glutamate receptors. They're calcium permeant glutamate receptors and so the thinking here is that Amantadine may decrease excit0toxicity via activation of the NMDA receptors.  
* Antioxidants, such as Co-enzyme Q10, perhaps creatine, are thought to act because of the toxins that have been identified that seemed to poison particularly mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons. So the thinking is that if you can prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species, either by helping the mitochondria or by preventing the oxidation of dopamine then you have provided a way for dopamine neurons to function better.  
* And finally adenosine receptor antagonists, which are Gs coupled. Either the A1 adenosine receptor or the adenosine A2A receptor have been used for Parkinson's, the mechanism of these antagonists and of their helpful effects is uncertain, at least to me.

**Slide>> Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease**  
*Now, another therapy for Parkinson disease is not a drug, but it is so effective that we should mention it here. It is deep brain stimulation. Here is our diagram of the basal ganglia in the mid brain.  For a period of a couple of decades neurosurgeons interrupted the feedback loops which cause tremor, by literally ablating,  sometimes cauterizing individual groups of neurons, in the basal ganglia. Sometimes the globus pallidus pars exterior. Sometimes the subthalamic nucleus sometimes, I'm not sure whether neurosurgeons ever bladed the globus pallidus pars interior.  

* Now, in order to get the damaging instrument in exactly the right place, neurosurgeons started putting electrodes into the brains to find out whether they were getting the characteristic discharges from the neurons in either the GPe or the STN. And ultimately to make sure, they started stimulating these neurons and that stimulation itself, not destruction but merely stimulation of the neurons seemed to decrease the tremors. So this lead to the rapid development of several wonderful devices which can be implanted in the brain that stimulate neurons without killing them, and stop the tremors and other movement abnormalities in Parkinson's disease.  

* How does deep brain stimulation work? It's not clear. Does it work by activating neurons? Possibly. But the stimulus frequency which is about 160 Hertz is a bit too rapid to have sustained activation of neurons. And so the theory has developed that perhaps by keeping neurons depolarized. Keeping those sodium channels inactivated, you remember we talked about the inactivation flap on sodium channels? Well perhaps this silences neurons.  

* And then there's another set of data which have arisen recently, that perhaps what the deep brain stimulation is doing is actually activating axons passing through one or the other regions of the basal ganglia. So, this is an exciting field, the mechanism of deep brain stimulation. Stay tuned, and then we may have a chance to talk about deep brain stimulation using optical techniques. Next time, we'll talk about how one can protect against Parkinson's disease once it has been diagnosed in a patient.
