An edited transcript of Drugs and the Brain Lecture 40 Introduction to Psychiatric Disease 
 

* Here's another view of the cook off building with its carvings and arches and wisteria. That arch passage way is delightfully cool during the summer.  
* Hello, during this final week of drugs and the brain we're going to be talking about the very important, but very complex topic psychiatric diseases, and especially drugs for psychiatric diseases. Many of you students have told me that this is the reason that you're so interested in the course. And I hope you find that the material that we have treated up until now, prepares you to understand at least some aspects of drug treatments for psychiatric disease.

**Slide>> The recommended textbook by Nestler, Hyman, and Malenka**
* Let's get started by recommending again the book by Nestler, Hyman and Malenka. You can find a link to it on the course’s syllabus page. The three authors Eric Nestler, Steven Hyman and Robert Malenka are all psychiatrists with clinical experience. And they've also contributed importantly to research on psychiatry. Each of them have personally and in private conversation, taught me a great deal about psychiatry and psychiatric drugs. The material on psychiatric diseases is especially good and two chapters that we will be using this week include mood and emotion, chapter 14 and schizophrenia and other psychosis, chapter 16.  

* I'd like to remind you that as psychiatric disease can be diagnosed only if a person has clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or in other important areas of functioning. So, those societies that try to marginalize people if they are politically or socially inconvenient, by calling them mentally ill, are actually not adhering to our definition of mental illness. And the other point to be made is that the statement, 90% of suicide victims have a mental disorder, derives in part from the assumption that any person who destroys himself has significant distress or impairment in his functioning.

**Slide>> Major Depressive Disorder**
* We will be discussing Major Depressive disorder, Bipolar disease and Schizophrenia in that order. And as usual we will go through our six part description of the diseases. We will treat clinical descriptions, a bit more cursorily than usual because the diagnostic and the statistical manual of mental disorders, the diagnostician's bible, is undergoing a transition from the fourth to the fifth edition. And there will be some changes that occur over the next year or so in the definitions of psychiatric diseases.  

* We will treat the genetics of psychiatric disease. When we get to schizophrenia I will remind you that these are complex disorders and that they are polygenic, multifactorial and partially penetrant. We'll explain what those means.  

* We’ll discuss the pathophysiology which is a very important topic for psychiatric diseases but also our frustrations that we know so little about the pathophysiology.  
* We'll discuss bio-markers for psychiatric diseases and animal models and I'll remind you that these animal models rarely account for, or reproduce the so called, therapeutic lag at the two to three week period that it takes a psychiatric drug to achieve its full effect.  
* When we discuss bipolar disease, we'll talk about the heterozygotic advantage. And of course we will emphasize drug therapeutic approaches, both the existing ones and how they work and the experimental ones and what their prospects are. We'll also discuss right here and then not again, the challenge posed by the placebo effect.  

* Often in clinical trials, patients want to feel better, and they like the attention that they're getting from the trial conductors, and so they state that they do feel better. Now, an unusual take on the placebo effect is this book by Robert Scott, who is a historian, entitled Miracle Cures: Saint's pilgrimage and the healing powers of belief published in 2010. Basically Bob Scott told me when he finished the book he realized that he had written a book about the placebo effect. During the Middle Ages when people knew very little about the causes of any disease, it was natural to blame the spirits of deities. And so a person who got a disease was deemed to be not chosen and was perhaps stigmatized because of the disease. And so going on a pilgrimage or being cured was a sign that, that person had found favor in sight of God, or in the sight of the local saint. So, as we say, this is an interesting take on the placebo effect.

**Slide>> Psychiatric Diseases present a large global burden**
* Now, psychiatric diseases present a large global burden. There is a unit called the DALY which is the Disability Adjusted Loss of the Years worth of full health and this is a chart of the world health organization's data for DALYs for women around the world, aged fifteen to 44 years. And so, this chart tells us that among high income countries three major sources of loss of full health, loss of work, loss of productivity, happiness, are the psychiatric diseases that we're going to discuss this week.  

* Unipolar depressive disorder, as we'll see, seems to be reported more for women than for men, so this bar would be shorter for men. Schizophrenia, very important. Bipolar disorder, very important, both in low and high income countries. Migraine another very important disorder of the brain will unfortunately not be treated in our course just for lack of time.

**Slide>> How do psychiatric drugs work?**
* We come back to this problem, how do psychiatric drugs work? The two to three week delay continues to present a mystery. In these quotes from the Nestler book reminds us that we understand a bit about for instance the antidepressants that work on serotonin transporters. But we don't understand, what happens in the two to three weeks that it takes, fluoxetine or another SSRI (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor) to produce its full effects. And indeed SSRI are thought to help roughly 50% of major disorder patients.  

* When we talk about bipolar disorder, we will talk about lithium and another bipolar drug. It too requires weeks for its full effect, and nobody knows why. And when we talk about schizophrenia, we will again remind you that antipsychotic drugs, which are most often used for schizophrenia have another two or three week lag and we don't understand why.

**Slide>> Mood Disorders in DSM-IV**  
* Now in the next three or four lectures we're going to talk about major depression. And then we will talk about bipolar disorder. These are both classified in DSM four as mood disorders.
