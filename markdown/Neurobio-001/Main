# Introduction

Welcome to the wiki for Everyday Neurobiology!


Hopefully this wiki will serve two purposes:

1.  A structured place for students to share and combine knowledge.
2.  A place to organize and store staff answers to student questions.


The wiki will therefore be evolving over the course, as needed.
