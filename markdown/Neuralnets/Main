Welcome to the wiki page.

This wiki will be collaboratively created by students in Prof Geoffey Hinton's Neural Networks for Machine Learning course (Fall 2012).

Feel free to create pages as needed. To see how to edit or create a page, see "Help" on the left navbar.

[[ Lecture 2a - An overview of the main types of neural network architecture ]]

[[ Lecture 2b - Perceptrons: The first generation of neural networks ]]

[[ Lecture 2c - A geometrical view of perceptrons ]]

[[ Lecture 2d - Why the learning works ]]

[[ Lecture 2e - What perceptrons canâ€™t do ]]

[[Lecture 4c - A quick note on the cross-entropy and derivative of a softmax unit]]

[[Lecture 13b - The math of Sigmoid Belief Networks]]

[[Lectures 1-14 in one file]]
