Cubase is a Midi / Audio editing programming suite under a proprietary licence, started in 1989 by German based company Steinberg.

Computers such as the Atari ST (the first home computer with built-in MIDI support) were able to run Cubase and communicate directly with devices such as external synthesizers and samplers via MIDI. Recording of the MIDI messages was also possible - enabling musicians to record and playback different instrument sounds from the same MIDI notes. 

It was not until 1996 and the release of Cubase Audio that users could record and playback multiple audio tracks in tandem with MIDI tracks.

In 1999, VSTi was born: Software synthesis of instruments.This made third party development of Cubase plugins possible. 

By 2000, Cubase was capable of using a 32 bit word length (bit depth) for audio sampling and was now able to access its own real-time processing modules as well as integrating its first VST plugin - Propellerheads Rebirth.
