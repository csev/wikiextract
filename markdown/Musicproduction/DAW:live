##Editing Audio
details of editing audio
*Trimming
*Cutting - "Split" In Ableton Live - Left click on the audio where you would like to cut, right click and select "split" - Short cut Ctrl+E
*Grid
*Change grid resolution
**CTRL-4 (CMD-4 on a Mac) toggles the note grid on and off. CTRL-1 and CTRL-2 (CMD-1 and CMD-2 on a Mac) make the note grid wider or narrower. CTRL-3 (CMD-3 on a Mac) toggles the triplet grid. CTRL-5 (CMD-5 on a Mac) toggles between the fixed and adaptive grid, which automatically adjusts as you zoom in and out (I find it easiest to stay with the fixed grid). These shortcuts are under the Option menu at the top of Live if you forget them. You can also right click over the note editing grid and there is a pop-up menu where you can adjust the same grid settings.

To name a locator, select it by clicking its triangular marker, and choose the Rename Edit menu command (or use the [CTRL][R](PC) / [CMD][R](Mac) shortcut). You can also enter your own info text (page 9) for a locator via the Edit Info Text command in the Edit menu or in the locator’s [right-click](PC) / [CTRL-click](Mac) context menu. Locators can be removed with your computer’s [Backspace] or [Delete] key , the Create menu, or the Delete Locator button.

###Channel strip layout

**Channel Strip from Ableton Live 9**

[[File:MusicProd\_Ableton\_ChanStrip.jpg]]

**Sections of the Channel Strip**

1. Track Name - Ctrl (Cmd)-R is the shortcut key for renaming the track
2. Scene Area - Ableton Live accepts multiple clips for each track.  This area shows a list of those clips
3. Track mini-view - A bar graph representation of the clip.  Vertical bars mark loop points and current position in the clip
4. I/O Panel - Input and output for the track is set here.  Also the monitor output is controlled from this panel
5. Sends - Each track has a send fader for each return track in the project.
6. Fader - This section contains the track fader and down the left side the pan knob, mute, solo and track arm buttons.
7. Delay - Each track has an optional delay value
8. Crossfade bank - Ableton’s master fader has a crossfade slider that switches between groups A and B.  Tracks are associated with a group here.


###Configuring a Submix

There are three main ways to set up a submix in Live.  It is easier to do this in Session mode.

1. **Group Tracks**
Select multiple tracks and hit Ctrl (CMD) - G.  The output of all the tracks will be set to 'Group' and a new track will be created.  You can rename this track to an appropriate name for the submix.  Another UI feature in Live is you can fold up the group track to hide all the component tracks of the submix.

2. **Create an aux track**
Aux tracks are not called aux tracks in Live.  But you can create one by adding a new track ( Ctrl (CMD) - T ) and setting the 'In' button on the 'Monitor' section of the track I/O panel.  You can then route the output of all the tracks in the submix to that track.

3.  **Create a return track**
You can create a return track from the Live Create menu.  A new send fader will be added to the Send area of the Channel Strip.  You will want to set the output of the tracks in the submix to say 'Sends only'
