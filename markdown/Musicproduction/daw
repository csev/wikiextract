#DAW Wiki
We will need to work together to compile a resource that includes all major DAWs and the most common tasks in each. The structure is in place, just add a little bit. As a humble suggestion, for all of the DAWs listed below, it is extraordinarily helpful to read in-depth the software manufacturer's manual for the program, and most of the DAWs listed below should have links to their manufacturers' respective manuals. This is not to say that simply reading the manual is a replacement for actually using and getting familiar with your program, but it can be very useful to have something of a road map to navigate through what might be unfamiliar terrain. Another upside of this is that you can become familiar with the particular terms your DAW uses for certain procedures, tasks, etc., which might amount to the same thing as to their practical result, generally speaking, but be called several slightly different things between programs.
