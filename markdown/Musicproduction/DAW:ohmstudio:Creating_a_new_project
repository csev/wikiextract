The main features are:
*A Chatroom with connected users and contacts.
*A New Project Button, for new projects.
*A project list that allows to open, clone or share existing own and public projects.
*Access to the Documentation and the OhmStudio Forum.
==Creating a New Project==
A new project could be created by cloning an existing project or by starting a completely new one. A completely ''new project'' is created using the ''New Project'' button. A ''cloned project'' could be created from a list of Cloneable projects or from an existing own project. Appropriate buttons for each of these tasks are available in the Starting Window.
