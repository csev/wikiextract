*Cutting
To split clips in Audition CS6, click on the "Razor Tool" button (or press R) to activate the Razor mode. Then, just click on a clip to split it. Note that the position of the mouse does affect where the clip is split (i.e. click the clip in the middle to split it into halves).[[File:musicproduction_dawwiki_audition_razor.png|400px|thumb|right|The Razor Tool]]

If you click and hold the Razor Tool button, you'll see two options pop up, "Razor Selected Clips Tool" and "Razor All Clips Tool." Selected Clips is selected by default. If you choose Selected Clips, only the clip your mouse is hovering over will be cut by the Razor. If you choose All Clips, the Razor will cut any clip (in any track) overlapping that time point. These differences are more obvious when you try them out, because there is a yellow line that shows you what will be cut and where, before you click.

You can also choose Clip > Split (or press Ctrl+K) to split the selected clip at the current-time indicator.

##Efficient Editing

*Zoom
There are quite a few ways to zoom in Audition CS6. Here's a (probably not complete) list of ways to do it:<br>
1) Scroll the mouse wheel while hovering over the time ruler.<br>
2) Hold Ctrl while scrolling the mouse wheel anywhere in the editor.<br>
3) Right-click and drag on the time ruler to zoom into a specific region.<br>
4) Press + and - on the keyboard (uses the current-time indicator as the zoom-center).
*Nudge
*Cycle
Choose the Time Selection Tool (or press T) and click and drag in the editor workspace to choose a region of time. Now, the playback will stop when it reaches the endpoint of the region. To cycle, hit the "Loop Playback" button next to the Record button (or press Ctrl+L), and the playback will loop when it reaches the endpoint.
Note that you can also select a region of time by pressing I and O to set in- and out-points, respectively, at the current-time indicator.
*Merge
*Name
Right-click on a clip and select Clip Properties (or click on a clip and show the Properties tab). You can change the clip name in the text field at the top.
*Color
Right-click on a clip and select Clip Properties (or click on a clip and show the Properties tab). You can change the clip color in Basic Settings.
*Markers
Pull up the "Markers" tab. Here you can add and edit markers. Also, you can add a marker just by pressing M.
Note that (at least in Audition CS6) you can have a marker be a "marker point" (which is default) or a "marker range." You can change the marker type by right-clicking the marker above the time-ruler and select "Convert to Range" (or "Convert to Point" if it's already a range).
