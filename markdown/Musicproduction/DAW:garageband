*Bit depth

To change the project's bit depth, select GarageBand > Preferences... > Advanced; from the drop down menu at the top of the screen. On the advanced panel, there are three options: good, better, and best. The default "good" setting sets the bit depth at 16-bit. "Better" uses 24-bit in recording, but exports to 16-bit. "Best" exports in 24-bit.
Note: this does not apply in the latest Garageband (10.0.3) which only has a checkbox for 24-bit (24-bit checked, 16-bit unchecked)

*Sampling rate
By default, GarageBand records and exports and exports at 44.1kHz. There is currently no option to change the sampling rate.
