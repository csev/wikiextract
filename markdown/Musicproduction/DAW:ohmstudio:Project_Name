==Project Name==
Because OhmStudio is web-based and intended for collaborative music production it does not manage files like other common DAWs i.e. creating a particular folder in the hard-disk in which all project files are stored. OhmStudio uses a single name for each project inside the application, and stores project sound information and files in the cloud (their servers). Nevertheless a backup of the samples is created in a hard-disk location: ~\Documents\Ohm Force\Ohm Studio\samples. This folder could be changed in the Preferences Window.
