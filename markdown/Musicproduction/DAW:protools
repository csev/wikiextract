##Recording
details of audio recording
*Metronome(click track)
**Create a new track, then go to Track>Create Click Track.  A mono track is created with the 'click' plugin.  You can customize the plugin from there.  You could, instead, simply create a mono audio track in samples, then find and add the plugin yourself by selecting Inserts A-E>plug-in>Instrument>Click(mono).
**Customize the click by doing a left click on the plugin in the track strip within the Mix window.  click on the <factory default> button to get the Librarian menu.  There you can choose the click sound.  Next, you can modify the accented and unaccented settings (measured in dB) which help keep time while you create.
**To listen to your click track, click solo in the click track (in case you already have other recorded tracks in your session).  Select View>Transport>Midi Controls, then, in the Transport Window, highlight only the Metronome in the bottom right.  Be sure to de-select the Countoff button, and click Play.  Modify settings as desired.
