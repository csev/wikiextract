##Greek Mythology in Art

The Google Art Project is a huge project by Google to digitise artworks hosted in the world’s greatest museums.

+    http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/

The paintings and sculptures are photographed in ultra-high resolution and are presented in the form of virtual collections with extensive commentary on the subject and the artist. The project includes the new Acropolis Museum in Athens. A guided tour through the Greek Antiquities and the paintings that are inspired by Greek Myths is an ideal visual companion to the readings and lectures of the course.

#Film, TV & Radio

##Films

The Euripides Trilogy During the ‘60s and ‘70s Greek director Michael Cacoyannis (he also directed the film ‘Zorba the Greek’) wrote, produced and directed three film adaptations of famous plays by Euripides. All of them received rave reviews, multiple awards and nominations in the Cannes Film Festival, the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and elsewhere. The films are recognised even today as the most historically and artistically accurate adaptations of Ancient Greek texts (either plays or myths) in cinematic form.

###    Electra (1962)

The first film was Electra. It is based on the play of the same name by Euripides and stars Irene Papas in the title role. The film received the Award for Best Film Adaptation in the 1962 Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated for the Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film category. The haunting score is by famous Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis.

The film is available on DVD by MGM: http://amzn.com/B00005UJY8 (Amazon US)

Luckily it can also be found complete on YouTube in the original Greek with English subs: http://youtu.be/wWLpclJ3xfk

For more information you can have a look at the Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_%281962_film%29

###  The Trojan Women (1971)

In 1971, Cacoyannis followed with The Trojan Women, this time a US-UK co-production in English with an international cast that included Katharine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave, Geneviève Bujold and Irene Papas.

The film is available on DVD: http://amzn.com/B0002T2Q6U

The film is uploaded on YouTube in English with Greek subs: http://youtu.be/z7MF2phw_Oo

Also the Wikipedia article for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trojan_Women_%28film%29

### Iphigenia (1977)
Finally, in 1977 Cacoyannis returned to Greece to write, produce and direct the final (and many believe best) instalment in his trilogy of Ancient Greek plays, Iphigenia. The film stars once more Cacoyannis’ muse, Irene Papas, some of the most important actors of the Greek Cinema and Stage, and in the title role a 13-year old Tatiana Papamoschou in a truly heart-breaking performance. The film was shot in the actual locations in Aulis where the Greek ships according to legend were stranded waiting for the winds to blow and carry them to Troy. Most of the extras were actual soldiers in the Greek Army. It is said that it lost the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film that year by a single vote.

The DVD is from MGM World Films: http://amzn.com/B000PMFS6

There is a high quality version of the film available on YouTube in the original Greek soundtrack with English subs: http://youtu.be/piTgtvtsd7g

And the Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_%28film%29

###Antigone (1961)

The only other film version of an Ancient Greek drama that can be placed next to Cacoyannis’ trilogy is Antigone (1961). It was produced around the same time as Electra and also stars Irene Papas in the title role.

The film is aslo uploaded on YouTube in its full version with English subs: http://youtu.be/suN2Pq6qoKE

The DVD is available from Amazon US: http://amzn.com/B0002T2QAQ

And more on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_%28film%29

###The 300 Spartans (1961)

This Hollywood production is considered to be the most historically accurate film adaptation of the legendary Battle of Thermopylae with King Leonidas and the 300 Spartans against the Persian Army. The film was shot in locations around the actual battlefield in Thermopylae and stars an international cast including a number of Greek actors. The music was composed by famous Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis (of the ‘Never on Sunday’ fame).

You can watch the original trailer of the movie on YouTube: http://youtu.be/oRVE6o5Yz9Y.

The film is available on DVD: http://amzn.com/B0001NBMDK

The detailed Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_300_Spartans

###The Odyssey (1997)

This TV Mini-Series starring Armand Assante is for me the best adaptation of Homer’s epic poem in any medium so far. It runs close to 3 hours and follows the original plot of the epic very closely. The costumes and sets invoke the Greek cities of the Mycenaean times perfectly.

The film can be viewed in full here: http://youtu.be/c-7_8y-McLo
