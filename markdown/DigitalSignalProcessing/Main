Welcome to the Digital Signal Processing wiki page!

If you've recently solved a tough issue or gotten helpful advice about a review question, exercise, or the video lectures, please take some time to help out your fellow classmates by writing about it in the appropriate wiki page.

Feel free to create pages as needed. To see how to edit or create a page, see "Help" on the left navbar.

## Note sharing subpages 

The list of subpages for sharing notes below mirrors the module titles in the [Digital Signal Processing Syllabus](https://class.coursera.org/dsp-001/wiki/view?page=syllabus)page (add your own if needed):

* [[DigitalSignalProcessing:Introduction|1: Introduction]]
* [[DigitalSignalProcessing:DTSignals|2: Discrete-time (DT) signals]]
* [[DigitalSignalProcessing:EuclidHilbert|3: Euclid and Hilbert]]

## About the transcripts of video lectures

Transcripts of the video lectures can be downloaded from the [Digital Signal Processing Video Lectures](https://class.coursera.org/dsp-001/lecture/index) page. This is very useful, however these transcripts are generated by - and strictly reflect - the last version marked complete of the subtitles created on Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) for the videos, which get automatically transferred to that page: as subtitles viewed on the videos, as subtitles .srt page - and as transcripts.

Consequences: 

* One problem is that the first subtitles marked complete on Amara are those made by the [Coursera bot](http://www.amara.org/en/profiles/profile/jngiam/) that uses voice recognition: these subtitles are quite good for what they are, but they have the inevitable errors of voice recognition. And these errors also appear in the transcript. 
* Moreover, when someone human later edits the subtitles on Amara and mark their revision as complete, this also changes the content of the transcript offered in the [Digital Signal Processing Video Lectures](https://class.coursera.org/dsp-001/lecture/index) page. So people downloading the transcript for a given video from that page at different times might end up having different transcripts.

So the simplest solution would be for the human participants of the Digital Signal Processing course to go edit the subtitles for its video lectures directly on Amara, but without marking their revision as complete when they save it, until they are reasonably sure that the subtitles are accurate. These Amara subtitling pages for the Digital Signal Processing videos are gathered in the [[DSP "project"]](http://www.amara.org/en/teams/coursera/videos/?project=dsp) of the [[Coursera Amara team]](http://www.amara.org/en/teams/coursera/videos/).

For more info on how to use this Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) subtitling, see the [[Video Subtitles]] page linked in the navbar.

But if we don't manage to do that, let's take the transcripts offered in the [Digital Signal Processing Video Lectures](https://class.coursera.org/dsp-001/lecture/index) page with a grain of salt ;-)
