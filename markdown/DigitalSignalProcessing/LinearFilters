## Module 5: Linear Filters - note sharing

This page is for sharing notes about, and discuss, "Module 5: Linear Filters" of the [Digital Signal Processing](https://class.coursera.org/dsp-001/class/index) course.

### linear time-invariant systems, convolution


### ideal and realizable filters


### filter design and implementation


### examples

#### running numerical example «Real-time audio processing in C++» on Linux

Here is working source (you can diff it with original source): https://dl.dropbox.com/u/937480/rtproc.tar.bz2
Added CMake configuration and some functions' implementation for Linux, removed all VS stuff. This version uses distro's portaudio library, not internal.

Steps to compile:

  1. Install portaudio development files. For Ubuntu it can be done with `apt-get install portaudio19-dev`
  2. Install if needed cmake and run `cmake .` in project folder
  3. Run `make`

After that you should have compiled `rtproc` binary and you can run app with `./rtproc` in project folder.

All should be working now: app reads stream from your mic, applies selected effect and plays to speaker.
