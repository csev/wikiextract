# 4-2 Cardiovascular System: Heart as a Pump  
  
Greetings. Today, we are going to talk about the heart as a pump. And what we want to keep in mind is that the amount of blood that is going to be moving through the right side of the heart is going to be comparable to the amount of blood that is moving through the left side of the heart. So the heart chambers are depicted here, and what we see is that we have blood coming back from the vena cava, which is the systemic circulation. We are bring the blood back into the right atrium. The blood is then going to be moving from the right atria into the right ventricle. And then from the right ventricle it will leave and go through the pulmonic artery to get to the lung. Oxygenated blood will move from the lung into the left atrium and then from the left atrium into the left ventricle. And then from there out into the aorta, which then takes it through the systemic circulation. So this is a closed system and this is going to be the pump which is going to generate the pressures within the system. So again, as we are moving materials (the blood) through these different chambers, we want to have a unidirectional movement, and we want to have a coordinated movement, so that the amount of blood that is moving through the right side of the heart is equal to the amount of blood that is moving through the left. At the base of the heart, we have inserted valves. And these valves, then, are going to help us to have the unidirectional flow of blood from one chamber to the other. There are two valves: the AV valves. One is in the right side, and one is in the left side of the heart, which are actually going to open when we have low pressures. And that the blood is going to flow from the atria into the ventricles, and we are going to be filling the ventricles. These two valves will be closed when are starting to generate a lot of pressure from the ventricles, and that is a contraction of the ventricles. And so, these two valves close at that time and are going to experience much higher pressures. So, these two valves are attached by tendons to the papillary muscles within the ventricles themselves. The papillary muscles do not open the valves, but the papillary muscles prevent these valves from prolapsing, when that is to undergo eversion and to allow backflow of blood under high pressures. So the valves now are going to be closed during the filling of the heart. The other two valves, the one that is going to the lung, that is the pulmonic valve and the aortic valve are going to be open when we are having contraction. They are the valves that are allowing the blood to be ejected from the ventricle and out into the receiving organ  or system. So they are not tethered. So those two valves then do not have these chordae tendineae holding them in place. Those valves also open to pressure differences. So pressure differences are what is going to cause the valves to open in both chambers. So we have the four cardiac valves, and they are going to be for preventing backflow. The pulmonic and the aortic valves prevent the back flow into the relaxing ventricles, and that we are going to have a passive response to pressure gradients. The pulmonic and aortic valves open when the myocardium contracts, and they will close when we have relaxation. The AV valves and the mitral valve are on the left atrium, and the tricuspid is in the right ventricle. These valves experience high pressures and they are tethered so that they cannot evert. Those are the ones that are also going to open under pressures, but they are going to open under very low pressures and allow for filling of the ventricle. The pressures that we are dealing with on the right and the left heart are quite different. So, if we look at the right atrium, in contraction, we will generate about 10 millimeters of mercury, and the right ventricle is about 25 millimeters of mercury. The left atrium will have about 25 millimeters of mercury. And the left ventricle, 120 millimeters of mercury. So that the amount of contraction, that is the amount of pressure that is going to be generated from the ventricle, is going to be quite significant. And so, between the two valves, the one that is actually the most damaged is the[INAUDIBLE]. Valve. All right so how does the cardiac cycle work? So the cardiac cycle is a single beat. We are going to have one contraction and one relaxation. The contraction state is called systole and that is what is shown here. And the relaxed state is called diastole. And that is what is shown over here. So let's start with systole. So we are going to start where the chambers of the heart are completely isolated. The ventricle is completely isolated from the atrium. So, all of the valves are going to be closed under this condition. And the ventricles are going to be filled with blood. So the ventricles are filled, and the valves are closed. We then, on the ECG, will have a QRS event. And the QRS is going to depolarize the ventricles, and this is going to allow the ventricles then to start to contract. And as the ventricles contract, we will see that they are contracting from the apex towards the base, and also from the outside walls to the inside walls. And this is very analogous to when you have a toothpaste tube. If the hole for the toothpaste tube is at the top, and that is where if you start to squeeze at the top of the toothpaste tube, all of the toothpaste stays inside the tube. The same thing happens in the ventricles. If we started to squeeze the ventricles from the top where the valves are, then we would not be able to get the blood out of the ventricle. So we start to shorten the ventricles and we bring the walls in. So then, we are able to push all of the blood out through the valves, which are present at the base. Once we build up enough pressure that we can open the aortic valve and the pulmonic valve, we are ejecting blood. And we are injecting blood then, either into the systemic circulation or into the lung. Eventually, the pressure is going to fall within the ventricles. And as the pressure falls within the ventricles, then these valves will close and will again have a state where all four vales are going to be closed. This is going to be end of systole and at this point we will have a T wave on the ECG. After the T wave on the ECG, if you recall this is triggering repolarization. So we are going to have a repolarization event where then the contractor cells, cells are going to relax. And as the contractor cells relax then the volume of the ventricle will get bigger. And as it gets larger, the pressure within the chamber then falls further. And eventually, the pressure in the chamber falls to a point where we are actually going to open the AV valves. The AV valves open. And now blood will move from the atria into the ventricles as the passive filling of the ventricles until the very end of diastole, and at the end of diastole we have a little P wave. And the P wave is going to be followed by a depolarization of atria and contraction of the atria. And when this occurs, we are going to have a little contraction of the atria and so injection of blood into the ventricles. This is called the atrial kick, and it accounts for about 20% of the fill of the ventricles. At the end of this period, all of the valves will close, the ventricles are full, and then we start the next cardiac cycle. These events are what is diagrammed here and what is known as the wiggers diagram. So the wiggers diagram is very complicated. It shows not only the timing of the cardiac cycle, which is at the base where we have diastole, systole, and then diastole. But it is coordinating that with the ECG then. And with the pressure changes within the ventricles and within the atrium. So let's only consider the pressure changes within the left ventricle, and that is the red line. So if we are going to watch the red line, as we go through diastole, we are starting to fill and the pressure is increasing within the ventricles. It increases until we have a little P wave, and then there is this little extra sort of push of pressure within the ventricle, and then we have closure of the AV valves. At this point, all the valves are closed and this is the end of diastole. We would have a QRS complex which fires and now with all the valves closed, the QRS fires, and we are going to start to get contraction of the ventricular myocyte. And as they contract, pressure builds within the vessel within the ventricle. This is called isovolumic contraction. Isovolumic contraction simply means that all of the bloods that is within the ventricle is fixed and we are simply the pressure within the ventricle by contraction of the myocytes. At this point, the pressure now is greater than the diastolic pressure, that is the pressure which is present within the aorta, and now we will open the aortic valve and we have ejection of blood into the aorta. As the blood ejects into the aorta, the pressure within the aorta rises and we would eventually get to a point where the pressure in the aorta now is higher than the pressure within the ventricle, because the ventricle is losing volume. And that point, the aortic valve closes. And at this point we also have a little t wave. And the t wave then triggers relaxation of the cardiac myocytes in the ventricle. The cardiac myocytes start to relax. We have all the valves closed. So the volume that is within the chambers is fixed. And so this is an isovolumic relaxation. Isovolomic relaxation continues until the pressure within the ventricle is less than the pressure in the atria, and then the AV valve opens and we again have passive filling of the ventricle. And the next cycle starts. So that is one cardiac cycle. So we have one contract, one filling event, and one contractual event. One diastolic, and one systolic. The other thing that is noted on this chart is that, we have the sounds and that is the lub dum, lub dum, lub dum. These heart sounds you hear when you listen through a stethoscope. The one sound lub coincides with the closure of the AV valves, and the second sound, the dub, coincides with the closing of the aortic valve in the left ventricle and also it would be the closing of the pulmonic valve in the right ventricle. The two valves are going to be synchronous in their opening and closing. Because again, we are going to have synchronous contraction, synchronous movement of blood throughout the entire system. Under the normal circumstances,  the left ventricular systolic pressure is a 120 millimeters of mercury and the left diastolic is about 80 milliliters of mercury, the right systolic is 25 and the right diastolic pressure is 10. Now another way that we can look at at the cardiac cycle is to actually look at a PV loop. That is the pressure-volume loop. In a pressure-volume loop, we are plotting the change in pressure as we change the volume within the ventricles. And this is only the left ventricle, which is[INAUDIBLE] depicted. So if we start at A, we have the AV valve is open,  and we are filling the ventricle. And so our volume then is moving from 50 to 90 milliliters. At B, we have the N diastolic volume. So it is the end of diastole that is the end of filling, and we now have closing of the valves. And so we close the AV valve and we undergo isovolumic contraction, and that takes us to C. With this isolvolumic contraction you can see that the pressure is increasing within the system. At C, the pressure is such that it is bigger than what the diastolic pressure which is within the aorta, and we now open the aortic valve and we now have an injection of blood. So we lose volume from the ventricle. And at D, we have closing of the aortic valve, and then this is followed by a relaxation event where we have isovolumic relaxation and we would come back to A. D is the end systolic volume. A stroke volume would be end diastolic volume minus end systolic volume, and that would be stroke volume. So that is the amount of blood that has been ejected from this ventricle. If I took this heart and I filled this heart with more and more and more volume, I could actually move the heart along this line which is depicted here. So it is D, this red line, which is up here and that is what is shown with the green loop. This line is called the cardiac function curve, and we will come back to the cardiac function curve a little bit later. Okay. So cardiac performance, then, is that we are going to have to change our output from the heart in order to match the needs of the body. Normally, each ventricle has about 120 milliliters at the end diastolic volume. And during one systolic contraction, then we eject usually 70 milliliters. This is the stroke volume. Not all of the blood in the ventricle is ejected, and about 55 milliliters is staying within the ventricle. It is never filled with air. So the ventricle then, is always has blood in it. And the stroke volume is going to be the end diastolic volume minus the end systolic volume. The stroke volume is how much blood we eject per beat. Cardiac output. That is the amount of work that the heart is doing is the amount of volume that is being pumped per minute. And that is going to be equal to stroke volume times heart rate. Heart rate is typically 72 beats per minute. And the stroke volume is 70. So the cardiac output is 5 liters per minute. Now, we have in instances where we can have very low heart rates. We can have an individual, such as Lance Armstrong, who has a heart rate of 35. He has a heart rate of 35, but he his cardiac output at rest is 5 liters per minute. And so that means the stroke volume has to increase. So the parameter of heart rate and stroke volume are two parameters that can be modulated by the body to increase cardiac output. 
So what are our key concepts? 
*The heart consists of two separate pumps. And blood moves in a unidirectional manner from the right heart to the lung, for gas exchange, and then returns to the left heart, from which it is pumped to the systemic circulation toward delivery to tissues. 
*Secondly, each beat of the heart is a cardiac cycle that starts with an electrical activation of the atria and then of the ventricles. And this sequence is the same for both the right and the left chambers. 
*Thirdly, ventricular contraction and injection occurs during systole. And beginning systole coincides with the first heart sound, and it ends with the second heart sound.
*Then the fourth. The ventricle relaxation and filling occurs during diastole. And diastole begins, then, after the second heart sound,  and it ends with the first heart sound. 
*And five, the volume of blood that is ejected with each beat is called the stroke volume. 
*And six, the sum of the stroke volume ejected in one minute  is cardiac output. 

All right, so for the next time we come in here, we are going to talk about cardiac performance. And see how we can modulate both the stroke volume and the heart rate to increase cardiac output. Okay, see you then.
