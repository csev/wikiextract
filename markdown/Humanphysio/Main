## Edited Lecture Transcripts  
These are edited and reformatted versions of the subtitle files that accompany the lecture videos. There are many errors, redundancies, and other confusing thigs in the subtitles, and these edited versions are to help those who are not fluent in English. The lectures must be extremely difficult to follow, understand, and then to translate, and so I hope that by posting these, it is helpful in some way.  
**Note: Some video lectures have been re-recorded, which means that some transcripts might not match the video. Please leave a note if this happens, so that I can post an updated version. Thanks.**

## Lecture Notes  
One great way to share with your classmates what you have learned is to write notes. Writing and improving the notes will both help you to understand the material better and help to supplement the courses.
