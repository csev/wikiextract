# 3-5 Smooth Muscle: Structure, Regulation and Pacemakers  
  
Greetings. Today we are going to continue our discussion of muscle, and we want to particularly talk about smooth muscle.   
  
**Structure**  
Smooth muscle is an involuntary muscle that is regulated by the autonomic nervous system.   
  
Smooth muscle has some special properties about it that differ very significantly from striated muscle, which is both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle.   
  
One of those is that smooth muscle actually can divide throughout the life of the organism. And secondly, that it will change in size, so that if you have increase in mechanical work, smooth muscle will get fatter or it will get longer. So the smooth muscle has both hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia.  
  
The smooth muscle is found around the walls of the blood vessels, and it is found in the walls of the visceral organs.   
  
The smooth muscle, like other muscles, does in fact have 3 of the very important principles.   
  
The first is that the smooth muscle will use the sliding filament mechanism for contraction. This is where we have myosin filaments walking past the actin filaments and drawing the actin filaments closer together.   
  
The second thing is that the myosin and actin interactions are going to be governed by calcium. So, in order to get a contraction event, we will have an increase in cytosolic calcium.   
  
The third is that we are going to have a change in the membrane potential, or a change in the membrane in going to be reflected by a change in the amount of calcium within the cytosol. Then the amount of calcium, in turn, is going to activate contraction. So this is, again, going to be our E-C Coupling.   
  
Now, the smooth muscle itself is a cylindrical cell. It looks sort of like a cigar. It is very narrow at one end, they have tapered ends, and they are about 2 microns in diameter. The center of the cell, where the nucleus is, is about 10 microns in diameter.   
  
In the light microscope, the cell does not show the banding that we see in striated muscle, and instead, the actin filaments are attached directly to the plasma membrane through what are called dense bodies. These dense bodies are analogous to the z lines that we see in striated muscle. The actin actually is coming in at an angle to the interior of the cell in so that the actin on opposites sides of the cell is is going to interact with myosin which is between these filaments, and draw the parts of the cell in close together. In the contracted state, we are going to have a cell which is going to change from a cigar or elongated shape, to a cell that looks like a postage stamp. And that is what is shown here.   
   
The other thing that is unusual about these sarcomeres of the smooth muscle is that we have no troponin present on thin filament. So you have no troponin-tropomyosin complex for the regulation of those thin filaments by calcium, and because the cells are very small in diameter, we have no T tubules.  
  
So the {??} then, when we dump the calcium from the interior of the cell is going to be by diffusion, we do not need to have the T tubules.   
  
**Regulation**  
Now, the contraction of the smooth muscle is going to be regulated by myosin, or the thick filament.  
  
And if you recall, myosin is a molecule that has a rod area and then the head. And the head group actually is our ATPase. So this myosin, this what I have just drawn for you, is the heavy chain of myosin.   
  
But there is also a light chain of myosin which is a regulatory chain and regulates the head. This light chain in smooth muscle becomes phosphorylated when calcium rises within the interior of the cell, and the phosphorylation event of the light chain actually is going to activate the head group of the myosin, and allow then the interaction between myosin and actin.   
  
So regulation of contraction is by calcium, but that the regulation is going to be on the thick filament, the myosin filament, not on the thin filament as we have seen in striated muscle.   
  
The other part about this system is that this is a special kinase. It is called the myosin light chain kinase that adds this phosphorylation group to this ATPase head. The other thing about this is that this is going to be a slow ATPase, so this is a slow acting contraction. This calcium itself is going to be released from intracellular stores just like we see in striated muscle, and that is that it is going to come from the endoplasmic reticulum or the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle is the interior storage site for the calcium, and on its surface it will have ryanodine channels. And these ryanodine channels will not open as they do in skeletal muscle to a rise in calcium.   
  
So we will have a small amount of calcium entering into the cell, and then that amount of calcium will bind to the ryanodine channel and cause a dump of a very large amount of calcium to come out of the endoplasmic reticulum and bathe all the contractual elements.   
  
To remove the calcium we have a calcium ATPase on the endoplasmic reticulum, just as we have in skeletal muscle. But their smooth muscle can also cause a release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum by actually using a second receptor, and that receptor is the inositol trisphosphate. And, so, that allows metabotropic receptors on the cell surface to activate a change in intracellular calcium within the smooth muscle cells, and we will talk a little bit about how this is actually occurs.   
  
So again, it is the calcium that is going to regulate our contraction, and calcium is going {??} and a rise in calcium causes a phosphorylation of the myosin light-chain. And that activates the head group who remove the calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We dephosphorylate that head and contraction stops, and we have relaxation.   
  
**Contraction**  
Now there are several different types of contraction in smooth muscle. Smooth muscle is able to contract to variable states, so that we can actually have what is called a tonic contraction. We can have a contraction where it is completely contracted down as we see in sphincters between for instance along the GI tract, between the stomach and the duodenum. And here, we have to relax the muscle in order to allow materials to pass from one compartment to another.   
  
In addition to this though, we also have smooth muscle sitting around blood vessels, and in the body they have a certain tone, or certain toneness that is a basal state. They can contract further down and decrease the diameter of the blood vessel, or they can relax and then allow the blood vessel to increase in the lumen size to increase. This ability to have in a sort of variable amount of contraction state is a property of the tonic types of smooth muscle.   
  
The other type of muscle that we see is a phasic type of a contraction. And that is that you stimulate the smooth muscle, it contracts and then it will relax when we remove calcium.   
  
Smooth muscle also has a very variable type of regulation, and it can have both positive and negative regulation. So remember in striated muscle, skeletal muscle, whenever we activated the neuromuscular junction, it was always excitatory. In this case, the smooth muscle can either be inhibited because it is relaxed, or we can cause it to contract. It is the net effect of all of these different impinging factors on the smooth muscle that dictates its actual contracted state.   
  
We have, in some smooth muscles, what are called mechanically-gated channels, and this is simply that these are stretch channels. So if we have on our blood vessel, we have these this type of channel, and if we increase the amount of blood that is flowing through that vessel, we will stretch the smooth muscle of the walls, and that will cause calcium to enter through these mechanically-gated channels and cause a contraction.   
  
We can also have ligand-gated channels present on the smooth muscle, and as I said, the autonomic nervous system actually can control smooth muscle. We have alpha one adrenergic receptors, which are going to cause contraction of the smooth muscle, blood vessels, for instance. And we have beta 2 receptors which are present on the smooth muscle's airways, which cause the airways to dilate or cause that smooth muscle to relax.   
  
Smooth muscles also sensitive to hormones such as oxytocin. When the mother is delivering her baby, the oxytocin is released into the system, and this hormone actually causes stronger contractions of the uterine smooth muscle.   
  
And finally we can have paracrine agents. Paracrine agents, such as nitric oxide, which is a gas, is released and it will actually cause an increase in cyclic GMP within the cells. And that actually is going to diminish the amount of calcium, the amount of phosphorylation on the myosin chain, and we are going to get a relaxation event.   
  
And then lastly, we have the voltage-gated channels, and the voltage-gated channels here are going to be voltage dependent calcium channels.   
  
Now, the smooth muscle also has a pacemaker. Some smooth muscles have pacemaker activity, and we have never talked about that before. What is known of its pacemaker activity is that the resting membrane potential is actually not stable. So, for instance, here, we are starting with a -55 millivolts, and slowly, the resting membrane potential is drifting towards threshold, which is at -35 millivolts.   
  
When the resting membrane potential reaches -35 millivolts., it then will trigger an action potential. And we have the opening of the voltage-gated calcium channels to repolarize the cells. We will open the voltage-gated potassium channels, that potassium then will exit the cells, and we will repolarize. As we repolarize, then we come back to -55 millivolts., the resting membrane potential, and it starts to drift back toward threshold. This is very periodic event and it has a very set timing, and so it will occur again, again, and again. And this is called then the pacemaker potentials.   
  
**Classes of Smooth Muscle**  
Now, there are two kinds of smooth muscles which are which we sort of put into two different classes.  
  
These are called the single-unit smooth muscles. Single-unit smooth muscle, are connected to one another through [inaudible], so they are mechanically connected so when they contract they pull on each other, and so the entire sheet will pull against each other.   
  
And then they also have gap junctions, and this allows then for electrical communication from cell to cell. And so that the contraction event for the entire sheet is going to be synchronized.   
  
These are the types of the smooth muscles that we find in the walls of the GI Tract, in the uterus and around small blood vessels.  
  
The other type of smooth muscle are called multi-unit smooth muscle, and in this case then, every single cell is actually innervated so that, because their not electrically coupled, we can have one smooth muscle sitting next to another. And it will contract, but its neighbor will not.   
  
These muscle cells are usually connected to one another through [inaudible] zones. So they are mechanically connected, but they do not have this electrical coupling. The cells that have this type of a personality are ones which are not going to be sensitive to stretch activation. And these are the smooth muscle cells which are involved with raising your hair on the skin, which whenever you get frightened or you are very cold.   
  
**Key Concepts**  
So what are our key concepts then?   
Smooth muscle is involuntary, non striated muscle, and it is associated with blood vessels and with visceral organs.   
  
The smooth muscle contains overlapping proteins, myofilaments, which are actin and myosin. The relative sliding of the actin past the myosin is what allows for shortening or contraction, and this is what generates the force.   
  
This process involves cross bridge formation between the actin and the myosin, and it is driven by ATP and the ATPase is located on the myosin head.   
  
The third key concept is that we have a coupling between the membrane action potential and contraction, and this is going to be mediated by a change in intercellular calcium levels.   
  
Calcium regulates myosin to enable the cross bridge formation and the generation of tension.   
  
The fourth is that smooth muscles are going be regulated by the autonomic nervous system, and that some smooth muscles also regulated by stretch, by hormones or by paracrine factors.   
  
Five, we have the pacemaker cells, which are a very special type of smooth muscle. These action potentials are initiated by an influx of extracellular calcium. We have an unstable resting membrane potential. The cell's resting membrane potential slowly rises to this threshold and we open a voltage-gated calcium channel.   
  
And then lastly, some smooth muscle will exhibit fused tetanus. These are the ones that have use of the phasic muscles, where if we stimulate it, it will contract. But if we stimulate it again, and again, and again, we can get summation of that contraction, and we can get a fused tetanus.   
  
We also have some muscles which are called tonic muscles, and these are the ones a variable contracted state. It can be highly contracted, such as we see in the sphincters, or we can have a variation in the contraction, such as you see in the bladder for instance. As the bladder fills, the muscles will stretch and eventually, when it is full, then the bladder will contact.   
  
Alright, so next time when we come in here, we are going to then talk about the last form of muscle, and that is the cardiac muscle. See you then.
