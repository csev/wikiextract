# 3-2 Somatic Nervous System: Control of Movement  
  
**Control of Movement**  
In this session, we are going to finish up the somatic nervous system, and talk about the control of movement.   
This slide is somewhat complicated, as this whole process is complicated. But what I want you to concentrate on is the bottom of this where it is talking about how the spinal cord, which contains the motor neurons for the body and the brain stem.   
The motor neurons for the head are going to receive information from receptors through afferent pathways that we have talked about, and then obviously controlling the muscle fibers as we talked about in the last session, but that the upper pathways (the pathways from the brain) are going to influence the brain stem and the spinal cord.   
The spinal cord is going to input to the brain as well, but that a lot of the types of movements that we are going to be talking about today are really centered in the brain stem and the spinal cord, with just some inputs coming from those upper pathways.   
  
**Lower Motor Neurons**  
We are going to talk first about two different types of lower motor neurons. Lower motor neurons being the ones that actually control the scale to muscle fibers.   
The first type are the alpha motor neurons, which are the ones you would normally think about that are going to innervate the fibers of what is called the extrafusal fibers of the muscle. These are the main fibers particularly on the outside of the muscle, and the main bulk of the muscle that is actually going to do the work of contracting and lifting loads and things like that.   
These are the fibers that are going to generate force. They are innervated by alpha motor neurons.  
However, in muscles, there is another structure called the spindle, which is shown here in the middle, and also has fibers. They are called intrafusal muscle fibers. They are innervated by gamma motor neurons.   
So very often, when alpha motor neurons are given the signal to contract muscle fibers, these gamma motor neurons are also activated at the same time so that the intrafusal and extrafusal muscle fibers are both often told to contract in a similar manner so that the muscle spindle is going to, in general, contract along with the rest of the muscle.   
The purpose of this is that there are a couple of different types of efferent axons leading to neurons that are sensing the stretch in the spindle. In this way, the spindle through it is contraction in parallel with the rest of the muscle, can feedback to the nervous system about the length and the stretch of the muscle. That is why there are two different types of motor neurons feeding into a certain muscle.   
  
**Muscle Sensory Receptors**  
Now we are going to talk about muscle sensory receptors. We just talked about one type, which is the muscle spindle, where we are going to have these interfusal muscle fibers, which are going to have, also as part of the spindle, these afferent neurons that are going to sense stretch of the spindle.   
This is going to be important for a reflex where if the muscle is stretched significantly (or above the threshold), then, that signal will be fed back to the spinal cord and cause a contraction of that muscle to prevent overstretching, and then relaxation of the opposite muscle (the antagonistic muscle).   
If there is a stretch in the bicep, than the bicep is going to contract, and the triceps, which are opposing it. is going to need to relax so that the bicep can contract.   
We will see in a minute how the circuitry is set up for this to happen and this is one of the important sensory systems in the muscle.   
This is a negative feedback loop because if you have too much stress (stretch) in the muscle, you are going to remove that stretch by contracting.   
In the muscle, I always remember muscle spindle. Spindle starts to s and it is responding to stretch which also starts with an s.    
Our second type of sensory receptor is the Golgi tendon organ, which is also shown nicely on this figure, where the muscle when it is attaching to the bone is going to attach through a tendon. The Golgi tendon organ is sitting in that tendon, and it is going to respond to tension primarily, which is going to be kind of the opposite of stretch.   
This diagram is showing the response of the Golgi tendon organ to different states of the muscle. When the muscle is relaxed, the Golgi tendon organ is really not firing. When the muscle is stretched, there is only a little bit of pull on that tendon. Most of the stretch is going to come from stretching the muscle, and so there is only a little bit of response that comes from the Golgi tendon organ during stretch.  
However, when the muscle is maximally contracted, that is when there is maximum pull on that tendon against the bone, and that is when we get a maximal response by the Golgi tendon organ.   
We think about the Golgi tendon organ primarily responding to tension, which is going to be coming from contraction and you can remember that tendon organ starts with t and so does tension.   
Again, we are going to have a reflex. that is going to occur due to a lot of stimulation from this Golgi tendon organ, and since we said that is going to happen during contraction, then the circuitry is going to be setup so that the response is to relax the muscle that has the increased tension, and then contract the antagonistic muscle.   
It is a negative feedback. If we have got too much tension in this organ because of too much contraction, then the negative feedback response is going to reduce the contraction of the muscle to reduce the tension that is occurring there.   
  
**Reflexes**  
We are going to talk about the reflexes that result of this.   
The first reflex we are going to talk about is the muscle stretch reflex, which is going to be activating the muscle spindle receptor, and this you are probably familiar with because this is the knee jerk reflex that the doctor tests when he takes a hammer and uses it to hit the patella tendon attached to the kneecap, so that when he hits that tendon, it pulls on the kneecap which then pulls on the quadriceps muscle really rapidly. So that causes a very dramatic and quick stretch of the muscle, which is then going to stretch the spindle, which is going to send this signal into the spinal cord.   
Then, because of the circuitry, that activated neuron is going to then activate the quadriceps muscle to contract. There is what is called an interneuron downstream of this afferent neuron, and when it is activated by the afferent neuron, is going to then inhibit the motor neurons that are innervating the antagonistic muscle.   
The response is going to be that you kick your leg. That is because the quadriceps is going to quickly contract, while the hamstring muscle in the back of the leg is going to relax. Your leg is going to extend and now you have reduced the stretch of the muscle as the response to the hammer hitting the leg.   
Now obviously, most of our movements are not just pure reflex as in that knee jerk reflex that we just talked about. A lot of it is going to be modulation of reflexes that are going to come from the brain.  
This example on this slide shows how the muscle stretch reflex can be used for more everyday tasks. And this task is going to be that you are, at the beginning, holding a glass mug. You know that someone is about to pour a soda into that mug, and you know that soda is going to add weight. You want to make sure you do not spill that soda, and you are able to reset the threshold - the gain, the sensitivity - of that muscle spindle system, so that when you are holding the mug, if it lowers at all you are going to really initiate a very similar reflex as the knee jerk reflex, which is to prevent any more stretch, and then to correct the stretch that is occurred due to the weight of the soda.   
So in this way you can, coming from the brain, adjust the sensitivity of the system so that even though it is not a dramatic stretch as occurred in the knew jerk reflex, any stretch beyond this point is going to cause the same response, a contraction of the bicep and a relaxation of the triceps.   
This is how this reflex can be modified to do more daily tasks.   
  
**Golgi Tendon Reflex**  
Then, we have the Golgi tendon reflex, which again is going to be due to too much tension at that Golgi tendon organ. We are going to see that it is going to feed again into the spinal cord.   
And again, we are going to have interneurons, one that is going to cause relaxation of the bicep since the problem was that there was too much tension. And then another circuit that is going to cause contraction of the triceps, which is going to cause relaxation and extension of the arm. This is going to be important as a prevention to injury of this muscle tendon junction.   
So if you are maximally contracting your muscle, there is a. Risk, of either tearing the muscle away from the tendon or the tendon away from the bone. And so this reflex is going to help protect that junction and preserve the anatomy so that there isn't an injury.   
It is going to be a negative feedback loop. We are going to finish talking about the reflexes when we talk about withdrawal reflexes, which instead of responding to a sensory receptor in the muscle, it is going to respond to, for instance, pain receptors. When this person you see can see here is accidentally stepping on a tack. And so again that sensory information is going from the pain receptors to enter the spinal cord.   
  
**Withdrawal Reflex**  
The circuitry with the interneurons is going to be such that we are going to cause a withdrawal reflex.  
So that means that the leg that just stepped on the tack is going to withdraw. The extensor muscle, the quadriceps, is going to relax and the hamstring, in the back of the leg, is going to contract, which is going to lift up the foot.   
However, we are also going to have to have a response in the other leg as well, and so that is going to occur. That is called the crossed extensor reflex, which is going to cause the opposite response in the other leg. That is that you are going to want to contract the quadriceps because now when you lift your leg that just stepped on the tack, you are going to have to have all your weight on the other leg, and so you are going to need to increase contraction of the quadriceps to extend that leg so that it can take the weight of the whole body.   
In this way, other somatic sensory inputs can influence these reflexes, and it is because of the circuitry particularly with the interneurons that allows for these proper response of the muscles.   
With this reflex, though, you can have inputs from the brain. So, for instance, say you were about to pick up your plate that has your dinner on it, and it is super hot. You are able to say, “Okay, I know this is hot.” Normally, you know, if it was not important, I would just put it right down, but it has got my precious dinner on it. So maybe you'll be able to hold onto it for a couple more seconds.   
Many times, we are able to modify our reflexes, or override some of the reflexes, to accomplish what we need to accomplish.   
  
**Central Pattern Generators**  
The last thing we are going to talk about are central pattern generators, which are actions that are controlled to a large extent by just the spinal cord. And these are going to be movements that are rhythmic and are every day movements.   
So one of the best examples for humans would be walking. Where there are two phases to walking. One, a swing phase,  is when your foot is not on the ground, and you are picking it up and extending it forward. And then a stance phase, which is when your foot hits the ground and then you are going to push backwards, extend your leg backwards to move your body forward.   
So this is going to be a very repetitive stimulation and inhibition of muscles.   
The other thing is that you have reciprocal innervation of the limbs. When one foot is in the swing phase, the other leg is going to be in the stance phase. And so, not only is there an oscillatory function with one leg, but you also have to make sure that each of your legs are in the opposite stance or phase.  
This is accomplished through circuits primarily in the spinal cord that are going to really involve interneurons, and that can be influenced from the upper pathways from the brain.   
One of the examples of being able to influence this through the brain is an animal, particularly like a four-legged animal, which has many different ways that they can walk or run. They can walk, they can trot, they can gallop, and they do this by having different patterns of which foot hits and which foots in which phase at which time. You are still doing the same motion with each leg. It is just the timing of the legs versus in terms of one leg versus the other, and this is what can be modified by the brain to allow an animal, even though the basic circuits are in the spinal cord,  to have different types of gates based on that input from the brain.   
This is just another view of the central pattern generators which are shown right here, how they are going to be important and give input into these interneurons that are going to be so important. And you can see also that we have some of these other afferent signals that we have talked about, like skin receptors and the muscle receptors, that are primarily going to feed into these interneuron that we talked about in terms of the reflexes, sometimes affecting just the motor neuron itself, and as we have talked about, had these descending pathways coming from the brain.   
Those are going to primarily also affect the interneurons, sometimes affecting the motor neurons that are then going to innervate the muscle fibers So these interneuron are going to be because the main source of influence in terms of these central pattern generators and in terms of the sensory inputs and the resolving reflexes that are going to happen.   
  
**Key Concepts**  
We have the sensory systems that are going to be important for detecting the stretch of the muscle.  
: the spindle, responding to tension in the muscle  
: the Golgi tendon organ  
We have talked about the reflexes that are going to be in response to sensory input, and how they are going to be based in the spinal chord.   
Then we talked about the central pattern generators and the importance of the interneurons in those actions.
