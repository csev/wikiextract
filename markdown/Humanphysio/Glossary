# Week 1: Homeostasis and The Endocrine System  
  
**Assay**  
1. trial, attempt, essay  
2. the qualitative or quantitative chemical analysis of something  
  
**Exogenous**  
Exogeny  
1. Influence by external forces.  
2. Growth on the outside or near the surface.  
Originating from a source outside the organism.  I believe in this case the professor was talking about implanting hormones  produced by someone or something other than the person that was being tested.  

**Symporter**  
An integral membrane protein involved in the movement of different molecules or ions in the same direction across a phospholipid membrane.  
  
Symporters belong to a class of protein "pumps" that move two or more substances across a membrane. Symporters move these molecules in the SAME direction. In contrast, antiporter's move them in OPPOSITE directions. These pumps are essential to the normal workings of the cell, and you're going to be seeing lots of them!   
  
**Tonicity**    
1. (medicine) The normal presence of tone or tension in a muscle or organ; tonus  
2. (sciences) The ability of a solution to exert an osmotic pressure upon a membrane  

  
**Trophic** 
1. Of or pertaining to nutrition
2. (ecology) Describing the relationships between the feeding habits of organisms in a food chain  
  
Something which is 'trophic' builds it up or strengthens it. Like atrophy means weakening, trophy means strengthening.
