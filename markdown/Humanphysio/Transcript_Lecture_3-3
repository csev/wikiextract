# 3-3 Skeletal Muscle: Introduction and Contraction  
Hello. we are going to start now with skeletal muscle. So we have been talking about how skeletal muscle is controlled with the somatic nervous system. Now we are going to talk about how contraction actually happens.   
So in this session we are going to talk about the three muscle types found in the body and just some general principles of those.   
And then we will move in to talking about skeletal muscles specifically with the structure, and then how the contraction occurs.   
And then in a second session we are going to talk about tension that is formed by skeletal muscle, and then some aspects of skeletal muscle metabolism.   
  
**Types of Muscle**  
So let's start off with the three muscle types that are found in the body.   
First, striated skeletal muscle, which is shown in this left most panel where we have large fibers that have multiple nuclei and they are stripped when you look at them in the microscope, so that is why they are called striated. And that is due to the alignment of the actin and myosin filaments that are in skeletal  muscle. And of course skeletal muscle is controlled by the somatic nervous system.   
Cardiac muscle, which Dr. Jakoi will talk about in a couple of sessions from now, is also striated, so it also has that really tight alignment of filaments that cause the striping or the banding of the muscle fibers.   
They are not as large as skeletal muscle fibers, and they have one to two nuclei. They also have specialized junctions between the ends of the cells that allow the heart to contract as a unit and striated cardiac muscle is going to be controlled by the autonomic or at least influenced by the autonomic nervous system.   
Then, we have smooth muscle, which Dr. Jakoi is also going to talk about, which are going to be much smaller cells that have only a single nucleus, and their actin and myosin are not as highly organized, and so, those cells are not striped. They do not have the stripes.   
And that also is going to be regulated by the autonomic nervous system.   
So there are some common principles that are shared between all three of these types.   
So one is, as I've kind of already mentioned, we are going to have myosin and actin and they are going to slide along one another to cause contraction of the muscle cell.   
These interactions with myosin and actin are going to be regulated by calcium and we will see how that happens in skeletal muscle.   
And then, it is always going to be a change in the membrane potential which is going to lead to contraction, and so this is called excitation-contraction coupling and we will see how that happens in skeletal muscle as well.   
  
**Skeletal Muscle**  
So let's move to talking about skeletal muscle, where when we consider a single cell of skeletal muscle that is the same thing as a fiber. In a muscle like your biceps, you are going to have the muscle with tendons on the end that are going to allow the muscle to connect to bone. And so in a muscle like the biceps, the attachment down at its (     ???) going to cross the joint, which is going to allow a short contraction of the muscle to make a big difference, cause a huge movement, in the lower part of the limb because the muscle is attached down across the joint. Attaching to the lower arm. So this is going to be a labor action that is going to be quite dramatic with a relatively small shortening of the muscle.  
Each muscle fiber or cell is going to run the entire length of the muscle, so these are going to be very long cells, and as we have mentioned, they have got more than one nucleus.   
Inside each fiber is filled with myofibrils, which is shown right here and right here. And then each myofibril is going to be filled with actin and myosin filaments. So the myosin is often called the thick filament, and it is going to be sitting in between two sets of actin. So it is going to be interdigitated between the actin, which is called the thin filament.   
So you can see the functional unit of these myofibrils are going to be called sarcomeres. And one sarcomere is going to be run from one z line to the next z line with actin heading towards the middle of the sarcomere and myosin interdigitated between.   
The force generating unit, the factor that is going to control how much force that a muscle can produce, is the number of myofibrils. Which is going to, if you have more myofibrils, you have going to have more actin and myosin in that muscle cell.   
  
**Contraction**  
So how does contraction occur? That is going to occur through the sliding filament model, where we have one of our sarcomeres. And when we look at that muscle cell in the microscope and we said we had banding. The dark band is going to be the A band. So you can remember dark has an “a” in it, and that is going to be anywhere there is myosin. Myosin is going to stain darkly. So, anywhere there is myosin is going to be the A band.   
The I band, which is going to be in the microscope light has an “i” in it, so you can remember it that way. That is going to be where there is only actin. So as contraction is happening, myosin is going to walk in towards up the actin towards each of the z lines, which is going to shorten the I band. So that is what's shown in this lower part.   
The A band is not going to change in length because that is just the length of myosin. So the filaments are not changing in length. It is just the amount of interdigitation between the actin and myosin that is changing. So during contraction, it is going to be the I band that is going to get shorter as the myosin my walks towards the z line at both ends and makes the I band shorter.   
  
**Regulation**  
We are going to move to talking about the regulation of this process, and we talked about already how it is going to be regulated by calcium, and in skeletal muscle, it is going to be regulated on the actin.  
So, here we have myosin, and when there is low calcium, these molecules troponin and tropomyosin are going to be in such a conformation that the myosin bonding sites on actin are blocked.   
However, when we have an increase in calcium, calcium is going to bind to troponin, cause a conformational change that is going to then cause tropomyosin to move out of the way, and allow access  to the myosin bonding sites on actin. So that is how calcium is going to control access of myosin to actin.   
The other thing that we are going to need in order to get contraction of muscle is ATP, an energy source. And so that is the ATP is going to allow the myosin to ratchet along the actin, to bind it and then move the myosin closer to the z line.   
So let's look at this cycle where if we start here, when we have ATP bound to the myosin head it will not be attached to the __ (?)  
However that hydrolysis of that ATP is going to change the angle of the myosin head and energize it, and then it will bind to the actin as long as we have got enough calcium around. Once the ADP form is bound to actin, then the ADP and inorganic phosphate can leave and that is when the crossbridge is going to move, it is going to ratchet. Which is then going to move the myosin closer to the z line.   
You see how this has now moved the myosin closer to the z line, and that is what allows for that contraction, and for the z lines to get closer together and for the sarcomere to shorten.   
If there is no ATP, then the myosin heads are going to remain bound to the actin and that is what is going to cause, for instance rigamortis, the stiffening of people's muscles right after they die because there is no more ATP around, and so that myosin cannot be released from the actin and that is going to stay that way until the proteins start to degrade enough that the muscles will become less stiff.   
So this, we have seen now how, is why we need calcium and ATP in order to get contraction of muscle.       
  
**Action Potentials**  
Now, let's see how. We know that the excitation of that motor neuron is going to send an action potential down it is axon. How is that going to lead to contraction?   
So, we know that acetylcholine is going to be released from the end of the axon in the motor neuron, and that is going to bind nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are going to be ligand-gated, acetylcholine-gated sodium (?) channels, which are sitting very close to voltage-gated sodium channels.   
So as soon as we get a firing at that synapse, we are going to have an action potential, and that action potential is going to spread over the whole plasma membrane of that muscle cell as well as through these extensions of the plasma membrane called transverse tubules, or t tubules. Transverse because they are at a 90 degree angle to the plasma membrane.   
These are invaginations of the plasma membrane that allow that action potential to travel down the t tubule, and to invade into that muscle cell. Because, remember, we said these are cells that have a large diameter.   
Next to these t tubules is going to be the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is a muscle specific form of the endoplasmic reticulum, that is going to be filled with calcium.   
So this little inset here shows why we need an close apposition of the t tubule membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. In the t tubule, we have the dihydropyridine receptor that is physically touching the ryanodine receptor which is in the SR. This allows the action potential that is going to change the confirmation of the dihydropyridine receptor to then open the ryanodine receptor, which lets calcium out of the SR and into the cytosol. So, that is going to increase the cytosol calcium levels, which is then going to allow myosin to have access to actin.  
The other thing that is going to happen however, is that once calcium starts increasing in the cytosol,  now a calcium ATPase is going to start pumping calcium back into the SR. And so as soon as calcium starts increasing, that pump is going to start acting to decrease calcium levels so that we will get some contraction, but then we will also get some relaxation once those calcium levels decrease, and myosin can no longer bind actin.   
Here is just another view of this system to give you more of an idea of what is going on in the muscle fiber. This is a single muscle cell that is shown in this diagram and we have got these gray t tubules coming in from the plasma membrane that carry the action potential into the core of the fiber. And then you will see how it is going to be flanked by this blue sarcoplasmic reticulum, so that we can have this dihydropyridine receptor next to the ryanodine receptor and get calcium out into the fiber and then you can see how the SR is surrounding each of these myofibrils so that each of these myofibrils is just going to be bathed in calcium each time an action potential runs across the plasma membrane.   
  
**Recap**  
We have talked about how in all muscle we are going to have this myosin and actin interaction that is going to allow for a contraction, how that is going to be regulated by calcium, and it is going to require ATP.   
Then, we talked about excitation-contraction coupling, how that is going to be important, that the calcium is going to be able to affect the actin that then allows the myosin to bind, and that calcium will be quickly removed to allow for relaxation.
