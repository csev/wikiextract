# 2-2 Nervous System: Membrane Potentials  
  
In this second session on the nervous system, we are going to talk about membrane potentials, which are differences in the charge on either side of the membrane that is going to be used as a signal by neurons. So we are going to start off talking about membrane potentials in this session which is going to help us to start to think about how neurons communicate. And one thing to keep in mind is something that Dr. Jakoi talked to you about is how the cell is going to use some of its energy to create differences in the number of ions on either side of the membrane.  
  
**Concentrations**  
* And so for the nervous system, this is going to be absolutely crucial for you to remember where the amount of the sodium on the outside of the neuron is going to be higher than it is on the inside, which is depicted here. And the amount of potassium is going to be higher on the inside of the cell compared to the outside.  
* So I am not as concerned that you remember the numbers for the concentrations that shown here in this table below but it is really important for you to remember that sodium is going to be higher on the outside of the cell and potassium is going to be higher on the inside and I am going to tell you later how this happens, but for right now for you to remember that is important.  
* The other thing to remember is that in a normal cell and a neuron just at rest the membrane potential, which is going to be the amount of charge on one side of the membrane versus the other, is going to be different. So that there are going to be more negative charges on the inside of the cell compared to the outside and so we refer to that as the cell having a negative membrane potential. We refer to the inside of the cell when we talk about membrane potential and since the inside of the cell has more negative charges, then we say that the cell has a negative membrane potential at rest. Okay.   
  
**Ion Channels**  
* Another thing, so we have established that we are going to have two different concentrations of these ions on either side of the membrane, but then what happens once we have ion channels? Which again, Dr. Jakoi has talked to you about where we know that ion channels are going to be specific, so here we are showing two compartments: compartment I and compartment II, where compartment I has sodium chloride in it, and compartment II has potassium chloride in it. In part (a), where we do not have any ion channels open, there is a membrane potential of zero because there is no difference in the charge between the two compartments. These red squares are referring to ion channels, and in this case, they are potassium ion channel. So, since we know the ion channels are specific, that means that these channels are only going to allow potassium to cross the membrane. Not sodium, that is sitting in compartment I.  
* Another important characteristic of ion channels is going to be that they are gated. So. they are going to only be open after a certain stimulus has opened them. And so, in some cases, as Doctor Jakoi mentioned, these can be ligand-gated ion channels that bind a certain ligand or a certain molecule and then open. Or, we are also going to talk about later some voltage-gated ion channels, channels that open only after a certain change in the voltage across the membrane.  
* And then the final thing to remember about ion channels is that they are bidirectional. So ions can move either way through the ion channel depending on the gradient. And so, when they think about which way ions are going to move through an ion channel, you have to take in consideration two things. One is the chemical or concentration gradient that is present for that ion and the second is the electrical gradient for the ion. And so we are going to talk about how that affects the movement of ions.   

**Equilibrium and the Resting Potential**  
* So let's go back to our system, where we have got our two compartments, we have got potassium channels in this membrane between these two compartments, and then in step (b). We open those potassium channels and so since there is a very large chemical gradient for potassium, potassium is going to move into compartment I down its concentration gradient.
* And so, as soon as that starts to happen however. we are going to start to get positive charges in compartment I, since potassium has a positive charge. Remember that even though we have a gradient for sodium, sodium is not going to move through these channels because they are specific for potassium.  
* So, potassium is going to keep moving in and moving in to compartment I until more and more positive charges start moving in. So that now, the electrical gradient is starting to oppose the movement of potassium into compartment I. And that is shown in part (d), where we have got more positive charges. We still have that chemical gradient that is causing potassium to move into compartment I. But we have an electrical gradient that is going to start to oppose the movement of potassium into compartment I, and since these channels are bidirectional, that means that potassium is going to start to move into compartment II as well.  
* So we have potassium moving into compartment I and into compartment II until eventually, even though we still have a chemical gradient. The electrical gradient is great enough and they are in opposite directions, but they are equal so that we get the same number of potassiums moving out of compartment II. As we get moving out of compartment I and that is what shown in (e) where we have equal numbers of potassium moving between the two compartments. Because now the chemical gradient for it to move into compartment I is equal in the electrical gradient, that is causing them to move into compartment II because the charge is so great in compartment I.  
* So in this state (e), now we have reached what is called the equilibrium potential for potassium. So, the equilibrium potential is going to be based on what the concentration of the ion is on the inside of the cell versus the outside of the cell. If you open channels to allow equilibration, the equilibrium potential is going to be the membrane potential at that point, once it equilibriates. So whatever this difference in charge would be would equal the membrane potential which is going to equal the equilibrium potential for potassium.  
* So let's talk about a real cell then, where we know that we are going to have high sodium on the outside of the cell, and low sodium on the inside, and so that means that the chemical concentration gradient is going to cause sodium to try, want to, enter the cell. Also we know that at rest, the membrane potential (the charge difference across the membrane) we said is going to be negative. That is what is shown right here and we will talk about how this is established rest.  
* So that means that the electrical gradient for sodium is going to want it to enter the cell as well because it is positively charged and the inside of the cell is negatively charged. So that means that if you open sodium channels in this membrane, sodium is going to want to rush in and it is going to rush in enough to make the voltage across a membrane, to make the membrane potential, +60.  
* So that enough sodium is going to come in that if you open only sodium channels, then there will be a +60 mV potential across a membrane. And at that point, at that +60 membrane potential, then both the chemical gradient and the electrical gradient will be in opposite directions, but of equal magnitude.  
* And so this is going to be an important thing to remember, and this +60 number is based on the concentration of sodium on the outside of the cell versus the inside. That is what determines that it is going to rest and come to equilibrium at +60 mVs.  
* Now let's consider potassium where we know it is higher on the inside of the cell than the outside, and that means that its chemical gradient is going to want it to leave the cell. But remember at rest, we said that the membrane potential is going to be negative. And so if you open potassium channels the electrical gradient is going to want to cause potassium to enter the cell. And so that means that if you are sitting at rest and you open potassium channels, because of the chemical gradient for potassium, some potassium is going to leave which is going to make the membrane potential a little bit more negative.  
* But then soon after that, the electrical gradient of potassium is going to be such that it is going to prevent any further leaking or diffusion of potassium out of the cell. And so, that means that the equilibrium potential for potassium, which again is going to be based on the concentration of potassium on the inside of the cell versus the outside, is going to be around -90 mV. So if you open potassium channels, potassium is going to want to leave the cell because of its chemical concentration gradient.  
* So basically, what the cell has done is taken two different positive ions, and concentrated them on two different sides of the membrane, which means that you have got equilibrium potentials that are of opposite sign, and we are going to see how the cell uses that.  
**Establishing a Membrane Potential**  
* So we have established that it is going to be the concentration of the ions that is going to determine what the equilibrium potentials are and we are going to assume that they are going to be very similar in all the cases that we are going to talk about, but then what determines what the membrane potential is at any one time. And that is going to be based on the permeability or the conductance of the membrane at that time.  
* So, we said that if we open only sodium channels, then the membrane potential is going to become the equilibrium potential for sodium. If we open only potassium channels, then the membrane potential is going to become the equilibrium potential for potassium. If the membrane is equally permeable, or equally conductive to sodium and potassium, then the membrane potential would be in between the equilibrium potentials for sodium and potassium. And so, that is how you can determine and predict what the membrane potential (what the charge difference across the membrane) is going to be at any one time.   
* Okay, now we are going to take a little detour to talk about how this difference in sodium and potassium concentrations across the membrane is established. And Dr. Jakoi talked about this a little bit, and then how this resting membrane potential is established. So, Dr. Jakoi mentioned the sodium potassium ATPase, which is going to be crucial for setting up this higher concentration of sodium outside of the cell and the higher potassium concentration on the inside of the cell. And it does this by using the energy of ATP. So it is an ATP.  
* So it is going to use the energy of ATP to move 3 sodiums outside of the cell. And 2 potassiums inside of the cell. And so that is what is going to establish our concentration gradients, which is going to establish what the equilibrium potentials for sodium potassium are going to be.  
* Now, note that 3 sodiums are moved out, versus 2 positive charges with the potassium coming in. And so, this sodium potassium ATPase is dumping more positive charges outside of the cell than it is bringing in, and so, that is going to cause negative charges to accumulate on the inside of the cell.  
* Also at rest, when there are not many ion channels open, there are a set of leaking ion channels that kind of somewhat slowly move ions across the membrane, and we have some sodium leak channels (what you are going to be shown here in blue). And then we also have some potassium leak channels, which are shown here in red. You will notice that there are going to be more of these potassium leak channels shown.  
* So the leak is greater for potassium then it is for sodium. And so, remember what we said in the previous slide where the membrane potential is going to be determined by the relative permeability or conductance of the membrane to ions. And we just said that at rest it is going to be leakier to potassium than it is to sodium. And so that is why the resting membrane potential is much closer to the equilibrium potential for potassium but just a little bit above it. And a little bit closer to the sodium equilibrium potential because of that small amount of sodium leak that is present as well. And so that is what determines the resting membrane potential, the potassium leak channels and the sodium leak channels.  
* Okay so, we are going to talk about soon how the signaling that is going to occur along neurons is going to be based on changes in the membrane potential and we have established that we are going to have kind of boundaries where that is going to change in terms of normal neurons, and this is going to be based on the equilibrium potential for sodium, which is going to be around +60, and the equilibrium potential for potassium, which is going to be -90. That is going to be our usual boundaries So we have these terms that are going to describe how the membrane potential is changing.  
* And they are always going to refer to how it is changed compared to the resting state, which is show as this red dotted line. And at this resting state, we say that the cell is polarized because there is a difference in charge between the inside and the outside. And we have said how it is going to be more negative on the inside of the cell, and so we have a negative membrane potential. And this is considered, at rest, to be a polarized cell.  
* If, let's say, we open sodium channels, which means the membrane potential is going to head toward equilibrium potential for sodium and become less negative, then we say that the cell is depolarizing, because it is becoming less polarized then it was at rest. If the membrane potential goes above zero, you can call that overshooting, as shown right here.  
* And then let's say, if we open some potassium channels, which means the membrane potentials now going to head down towards the equilibrium potential for potassium, then we say the membrane potential is repolarizing. The cell is becoming polarized again. So that is repolarizing when it is heading back down to rest.  
* If it goes even more polarized beyond rest, we call that hyperpolarizing. For instance, if it is heading and becomes the membrane potential becomes the equilibrium potential for potassium, then it is even more polarized than it was at rest and so that is hyperpolarized. So we will be using these terms when we talk about these changes in membrane potential that are going to be so important for signaling.   
  
**Graded Potentials**  
* So before we finish up this session we are going to talk about one of these types of changes in membrane potentials called graded potentials. And kind of the easiest way to think about this is to think about ligand-gated ion channels, where if you apply the ligand the chemical or the molecule that is going to bind to them and open them, then, let's say if this was a sodium channel, that is gated by a chemical, and it is sitting here in the membrane, and if you put just the smallest little amount of this chemical right next to this ion channel that is gated by the chemical. Then, it is going to open up and we know, because of the electrical and chemical gradient, sodium is going to want to come in, which is going to bring positive charges into this area of the membrane. Only this small little area because we have added just a little bit of the chemical to this little bit, this little spot.  
* And so that is going to give us an area of depolarization. The membrane potential in this area is going to become less negative. Now, since you have added just the smallest little bit amount of chemical farther away out here, its concentration is going to be too little. It is going to be diffusing away that it is not going to open any of these channels.  
* So, our area depolarization is going to be constrained to this little spot. And that is what shown here, whereas the further you get from this place where you have applied the chemical the depolarizations can become less and less.  
* Now, if you added more of this chemical at this spot, its concentration is going to be greater and it is going to be greater over a wider range of the membrane and so, you are going to open more of these ligand-gated channels. They will probably be open longer and so you will get a greater depolarization. The membrane potential will become even less negative then it was. So there will be a higher intensity of the depolarization, and it will diffuse and affect a higher portion of the membrane.  
* And so this is a very important property of graded potentials that they can be vary in their intensity based on the intensity of the stimulus, as well as vary the amount of membrane that is affected and that is depolarized or hyperpolarized. And so we will talk about how this property of graded potentials is going to be used by neurons in terms of signaling.  
* So, this figure is just to remind you that we can have depolarizing graded potentials. So, as we saw in this last example where we opened some sodium channels, so we are going to head towards the sodium equilibrium potential and we are going to have a small depolarization. But we could also add a stimulus that would open, let's say, potassium channels. And so we are going to head down toward the equilibrium potential for potassium. And it causes a hyperpolarization. And we will see examples of this.  
* And then, as we have already mentioned, If you have a stronger stimulus, you are going to get a bigger response than if you have a weak stimulus. And then, if you measure a distance away from the site of stimulation, that are depolarizing, our response is going to be lessened. And so, keep these properties in mind during the next session, which is when we are going to talk about a different type of change in the membrane potential.   
  
**Key Concepts**  
* So the key concepts are that we talked about.  
* The equilibrium potential for an ion and that is going to be when the chemical and the electrical gradient are going to be equal in magnitude but opposing one another. So we are not going to have any net movement of ions at the equilibrium potential.  
* We talked about how the sodium potassium ATPase is going to be important for establishing our sodium and our potassium gradient, and if you think about it after we now open some ion channels and we moved some ions then we are going to have to re establish these gradients of sodium and potassium.  
* And so one thing to remember is that this sodium potassium ATPase is going to be important for re-equilibrating. And getting us back to the resting membrane potential. And so, if you inactivate the sodium potassium ATPase for a long period of time, and then we have got these leak channels, or if we open ion channels, then eventually, we will dissipate our gradient and the membrane potential of the cell will be zero. So that is an important aspect of the sodium potassium ATPase.  
* And then we talk about graded potentials, which are going to be changes in the membrane potential, which are going to vary with the intensity of the stimulus and they can be inhibitory or stimulatory to the neuron and we will talk about that more in upcoming sessions. And that they can also have no refractory period which we have not talked about yet but that is an important characteristic that we will get into in the next session.
