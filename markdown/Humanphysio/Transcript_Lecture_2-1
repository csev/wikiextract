# 2-1 Nervous System: Introduction and Cell Types  
**Introduction**  
* I am Dr. Jennifer Carbrey and I am going to be teaching the next five sessions on the nervous system. And since Doctor Jakoi has already told you about the endocrine system, I want to remind you about some of the similarities and differences between these two systems.  
* So, both systems are going to be important for responding to different stimuli. But the nervous system is going to be important for very rapid responses. So the endocrine system is going to take time to produce a hormone, for it to enter the blood to circulate throughout the body, and then it can affect many organs.  
* The nervous system is going to be a very rapid system, and it is going to be a very specific response. And this is going to be necessary for the type of stimuli. That the nervous system is responding to. If you put your hand on a hot stove you need to be able to feel that it is hot and then contract and relax the proper muscles to quickly withdraw your hand and so the nervous system is going to have to be very rapid as well as very specific and so we will be talking about how that is accomplished.   
  
**Cell Types**  
* So in this first session, we are going to start off by talking about the cell types in the nervous system. And then in the second, third, and fourth sessions, we are going to talk about methods of communication in the nervous system, and so we will be talking about how it can be so fast. And then, in the final, and fifth session, we are going to talk about how the nervous system is organized.  
**Neurons**  
* So, obviously, the first and the main cell type in the nervous system is the neuron. And the main portion of a neuron is the cell body where the nucleus is in many of the organelles.  
* But then one thing that is somewhat unique among neurons is that they have all these processes. So they have many dendrites often and some neurons can have thousands of dendrites, and these are going to be processes that often receive information from other sources.  
* Very often, neurons have a single axon, and the axon is going to be usually used to transmit information away from the neuron, to downstream targets, such as other neurons, or things like muscles and cells. Sometimes the axons are branched, but often there is only a single axon.  
* So, it is important to remember that neurons can be huge cells. So for instance, in some of your neurons that are in your spinal cord, the cell body is in the spinal cord and the axon that is controlling let's say muscles in your foot had to go all the way down your leg into your foot to, to join up with that muscle that is controlling. And, axons can be as long as a meter. And so, if we are going to talk about communication along an axon, then it is going to have to be very rapid because these can be very long cells. And so we will be talking about that more.  
**Glial Cells**  
* Then there is another class of cells that you can find in the nervous system and these are called glial cells, and these are going to be cells that support neurons in many different ways.  
**Oligodendricytes and Schwann cells**  
* One type that we are going to talk about are Schwann cells and oligodendricytes, and these are two different cell types that mylinate axons.  
* So we talked about how long axons can be and to speed the conduction down them of these electrical signals that we are going to talk about, some the axons are sometimes myelinated, which is insulated.  
* And so in the peripheral nervous system, which is the part of the nervous system outside of the spinal cord and brain, Schwann cells myelinate axons by the entire cell wrapping around a portion of the axon. Which is shown right here.  
* This is in contrast to oligodendrocytes, which are found in the central nervous system, where one oligodendrocyte can send out many processes, each process myelinating a different portion of an axon, which is shown right here. So this is what is happening in the central nervous system.  
* And the Schwann cells are in the peripheral nervous system. And we will be talking more about myelination in future sessions.  
**Astrocytes and Microglia**  
* There are a couple other types of glial cells that I am going to mention this morning that are also important.  
* One type is astrocytes, which are going to be important for supporting neurons, so they make sure that the environment of the neurons is proper. They support the neurons metabolically and they are also important for processes, such as synapse formation.   
* Formation of contact between neurons so astrocytes are very important type of glial cells.  
* And then the final type that I am going to mention are microglial cells, which are a type of immune cell in the nervous system.   
  
**Review**  
* So in this short little session, we have just talked about the cell types of the nervous system, where we talked about neurons, which are going to be the main cell type that we are going to focus on, and then glial cells.  
* Neurons are going to be the cells that are going to transmit the information of the nervous system, and the glial cells are going to be there to support the neurons.  
* So, in our next session, we are going to start to talk about how information is transferred and signaled along neurons.
