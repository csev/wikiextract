# 1-1 Homeostasis - Homeostasis and Fluid Compartments

So today, we're going to talk about Homeostasis and the Fluid Compartments of the body. What we want to understand is the basic organization of the body, we want to define the fluid compartments of the body, we want to explain how the solutes distribute within the body, explain this concept of homeostasis, and explain mass balance.

**Body Components**
  
* So, the body components. What do we think about when we think about the body? The body starts, as you all know, as a fertilized egg and then under goes differentiation and division to give rise to what are differentiated cells that have specialized functions.  
* Several cells which have the same type of specialized function will then get together to form a tissue, and we actually have four tissue types within the body. We have muscle, nerve, connective tissue and epithelium. These four tissue types actually give rise to the functional unit, which is called the organ.  
* So, every organ is built from these four different tissues. The organs often will work with other organs to form an organ system. So then, they would then perform a specific function to the body.  
* For instance, we have the urinary system. The urinary system has two kidneys. It has ureters which take the urine which is generated by the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder stores the urine until we can evacuate it. And then, we release the urine from the body through the urethra. So that's the urinary system.  
* Now, we also have organs which actually provide the barrier for the body, and that is in a very important organ is the skin. This is an impermeable barrier which, which defines the outside world from the inside world. In order to overcome this barrier, we have the entry of materials, and particularly, gasses through the respiratory system, and nutrients through the GI system as, as well as water. These particular items are coming into the body through this two specific organ systems.  
* Then, within the body, we have to move the gases and the nutrients to all over the different tissues, and so we use a transport system. And the transport system is a cardiovascular system. But once we get down to the tissues, at the tissue level, there is a very short distance where we're delivering all of these materials and that's going to be done by diffusion.  
* And then, to exit the body, we use the kidneys, that's for fluid waste, and we have the GI tract, obviously for solid waste. So that's how you and I think of the body on a normal day to day level. But, the physiologists actually define the body in a slightly different manner.  
  
  
**Fluid Compartments**  
  
* The physiologists are looking at the body as two fluid compartments.  
* There are the fluid compartments that are bounded by the plasma membrane, and called the intracellular fluid compartment (ICF). That is where I take all the cytoplasm of all the cells, add them all up, and put them into this compartment.  
* The second compartment is the extracellular fluid space (ECF), and this of course is outside of the cells.  
* The intracellular fluid space is actually two-thirds of the total fluid compartment, and the ECF or the extracellular fluid space is one-third.  
* Now, between these two compartments, they have very different constituents. The ICF has a very high amount of potassium, so it has a high concentration of potassium, but it has a very small amount of sodium. So, a very low concentration of sodium.  
* And that is different from the ECF, where the ECF has a very large concentration of sodium and a very small concentration of potassium.  
* This dissimilar content of these two compartments is in fact generated by what we call the Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase. The sodium potassium ATPase is an enzyme which cleaves ATP. And what it does is it is going to pump, for every cleavage of this ATP, it is going to pump three sodiums out of the cell and allow two potassiums to enter. This pump maintains a gradient of ions across the membranes.  
* In addition, we have on the interior the cells, we have proteins, and these proteins are negatively charged, so the interior of the cell is always negative relative to the outside world.  
* Now, the outside world, the ECF, also has two compartments. It can be divided into the intravascular compartment, which is within the circulatory system (the blood), and the interstitial compartment, and this interstitial compartment is essentially connective tissue between the blood vessels and the cells. These two compartments actually have the same amount of salts within the two of them. That is the sodium concentration in the intravascular space is equivalent to the sodium concentration in the interstitial space. The same with potassium, the same with calcium, and so forth.  
* The two compartments do differ in that in the intravascular space, we do have proteins, such as albumen, which are present only within the blood and are not present within the interstitial space. But the ions are able to slow and so, as can solutes. So, a solute such as glucose.  
* So we have an equilibrium then, between the intravascular space and the interstitial space for solutes, but we have a steady state between the ECF (extracellular fluid space) and the ICF. That is maintained by the use of energy or the ATP. So, our fluid compartments then are essentially all of the water in your body is 60% of your total body weight.  
* So, if we have a 70 kilogram male, then there are 42 liters of fluid within that body. When two-thirds of that total body weight is going to be the ICF, or cytoplasm, and that is going to be 28 liters. The ECF, which surrounds all of our cells, is only one-third, and so that's going to be equal to 14 liters.  
* The intravascular space, the space that you think of as the fluid space of your body, that is the blood, is actually only 1/12th of the total body water because it is one-fourth of the ECF, and the ECF is one-third of the body. So, one-fourth times one-third is 1/12th. And so, the blood is actually only 3.5 liters. So what you think of as the fluids within your body, that is the blood, is actually the smallest of all the fluid compartments within the body and it's 3.5 liters.   
  
**Homeostasis**  
  
* So, we have self-regulating mechanisms then which maintain these two compartments.  
* We have the equilibrium, which is going to allow equal amounts of substances. There's going to be no net transfer of substance or energy between the intravascular space, and the interstitial space. We have no barrier to movement of the solutes between those two compartments, and we have no energy expenditure to maintain those two compartments.  
* In contrast, we have a steady state, which means that there is a constant input of materials into the cells and a constant loss of materials from the cells, and that this requires energy to maintain. So, our input is going to be equal to our output. So that means then that the ECF is sort of a little buffer zone outside of the cells.  
* Now, why would we need a little buffer zone? In you, as you go through your daily life, you are constantly changing your environment. You eat a Big Mac for lunch, you eat fruit for lunch. That brings in a lot of glucose, a lot of salt, and a lot of potassium into the body. The body now has to deal with all of these inputs, and yet, the cells want to have their sodium, their potassium, their water, their temperature, and their pH at a very special range, a range which is within (compatible) with their life. And the function of the ECF is to maintain these constituents within this very special range that is compatible with life of the cells.  
* And it is this maintenance of the ECF that is a relatively constant buffer zone, that is called homeostasis, and that is our central theme of physiology.  
* So, what happens with homeostasis? As long as our inputs are equal to our outputs, and it's within the range that's compatible with the life of the cells, we have wellness, everything's okay. But when you get out of whack, that is if our input that is going to be greater than our output, we can then end up with illness or what's called pathophysiology. And it is the cells, it is the function of the organ systems of the body to maintain homeostasis, to maintain this equilibrium. And if they are not able to maintain the equilibrium, that is when you start to see illness, pathophsiology, or disease.  
  
  
**Reflex Loops**  
* One of the major ways that the body actually controls the inputs and the outputs to these compartments is through what's called a reflex loop. And this reflex loop simply means that we have some type of stimulus which is coming into the body, and we have sensors which are able to recognize that specific in that specific stimulus.  
* The sensors will send the information to the integration center, and this is usually our brain. In the integration center, it actually has what's known as set points, so these set points are actually telling the body this is the range that has to be maintained in order for life to be happy within the body. If we are deviating from that set point, then the integration center sends out a response, and this response goes to effectors. The effectors then are going to then deal with the stimulus. They're going to change the input of the stimulus, and usually what they do is that they remove the stimulus and then bring the body back into its normal function.  
* So these reflex loops then are extremely important for the body. And what we're going to talk about the next time we meet are all the general mechanisms as to how these reflex loops are actually working, and the types of loops that are involved within our homeostasis, maintaining homeostasis.  
* But let's just look at a specific example. Let's say that you decide that you are going to start a high salt diet. You really like Chinese food and you really like soy sauce. So you put a lot of soy sauce on your Chinese food. You start your diet on Monday. And on Monday, the amount of sodium chloride (the salt that's coming into the diet) is equal to the amount that we're losing in the urine. So our input is equal to our output and we're in neutral balance. So, we have a neutral balance.  
* But by Wednesday, we are taking so much sodium in by the diet that the kidney actually isn't able to eliminate that amount of salt from the diet. And so that we actually then find that we have more sodium coming in from the diet than what we are losing from the body, and we are now in a positive balance for sodium.  
* But by Friday, the diet (the input of material to the body) is then equal to the loss through the urine. So now, we are back into neutral balance.  
* But notice, we have a lot more sodium within the body. We have increased the total content of sodium within the body. Now, how can that be when I just finished telling you the ECF's function is to keep that sodium concentration within a specific range? But I said to you that the content of sodium has increased. But did the concentration change?  
* What happens when you have that high salt diet? What happens when you eat a really salty meal? You get thirsty, and you drink water. You're diluting that sodium. The sodium is coming in, and it comes into the ECF. And all of this extra water that you're bringing in also comes in to the ECF. So we dilute the sodium that's within the ECF back to the range that the body is capable of handling.  
* So the sodium concentration of the body stays equal or constant, but the volume of the body has now changed. We have increased the size of the ECF compartment.  
* And what is within our ECF compartment? The vasculature. What did we just do to the blood of your body? We have increased its volume. And by increasing volume within the vasculature, we're actually are increasing pressure within the vasculature and you form hypertension. So you're actually changing the body's response. It is able to cope with the extra sodium, and it is able to cope with the extra sodium by having you go and drink water. But if the cost for doing that means that you have more volume within the system, then you now have hypertension.  
* So, the general concepts then is that the human body is this interdependent set of self-regulating systems whose primary function is to maintain an internal environment which is comparable with the cells and the tissues, and that's our homeostasis. And it's the stability of these internal variables, that's achieved by balancing our inputs and our outputs among all of our organ systems, and within the entire body.

# 1-2 Homeostasis - Regulation of Homeostasis  
  
So, today now, we are going to continue our discussion of homeostasis. But we want to think about how we are actually are regulating homeostasis. So, we are going to be looking at both the local reflex loops and the and the local regulation, as well as the more distance regulation, that is, with our reflex loops. We want to also talk about some of the general ways that which the body is going to be controlling various aspects of its homeostasis. And you will see as we go through the course, that we are going to come back and see these topics being reiterated as we are progressing through the course.  
  
**Regulation of Homeostasis**  
  
* So, regulation. So, they (the local response, that is), the local regulation occurs at neighboring cells. And that is what is shown here. So, at neighboring cells, we have what is called one cell can secrete a chemical, and this chemical then works on its neighboring cell because the neighboring cell has a receptor which can bind that chemical. This is called paracrine control.  
* We also can have control where the cell actually sends out a chemical, and that chemical feeds back on itself and controls the cell. That is autocrine control. So, we have both autocrine control, where the cell is regulating itself and paracrine control, where neighbors are regulating neighbors.  
* Then, we have another local type of regulation. And this occurs through gap junctions. And we are specifically going to be talking about the gap junction control when we talk about the cardiovascular system. This is how we coordinate the contraction of all of the cardiac muscle site muscle cells within the heart. So, this is that there is actually a physical contact between neighboring cells. And through this contact, we can actually have a flow of ions so that they move from one cell directly to the next cell.  
* But these are local responses and they are occurring at a local location.  
* What about how we control the rest of the body? These are going to be through reflexes and we already talked a little bit about reflexes and reflex loops. These are where we have a response that's made at a distance from the target cell. So now, the target cell is going to have a receptor for the signal, and the signal is going to be secreted either into the blood. In which case, we have an endocrine cell secreting a chemical into the blood. And that is then delivered by the blood to all the cells of the body. But the only cells that see that chemical are the ones that have a receptor. They are the target cells. So these target cells have the specific receptor.  
* The other way that we communicate throughout the body is that we have a nervous system. And here, the communication is much faster than with the endrocrine system. The endrocrine system, you are dependent on the delivery of the materials by the blood, and that is a much slower pathway. With the neurons, the neurons actually have a little tiny space between themselves and their target cells, and the target cell could be another neuron, it could be a gland, or it could be a muscle. They secrete their chemicals into these really tiny spaces and their information is flowing along their fibers as ions and it is a very fast flow. So, that the information going form the first cell to the second cell, the effector cell or its target, is going to be very fast.  
* So, we have two communication systems. The endocrine system is slow, uses the blood for delivery of its, of its signals. And the nervous system which is very fast, uses iron flows as well as very short distance we have chemical diffusion.   
  
**Reflex Loops**  
  
* The reflex loops then are going to have the same components that we talked about before, where the reflex loops starts, we have a stimulus. The stimulus is coming into the body. This is an afferent coming in to the body and is received by a sensor. And that sensor then sends the information to our integration center, and that is our brain, usually. And this has the set point. That integration center then evaluates whether or not the signal is within the normal range or whether it is outside the normal range. And if it is outside the normal range, it sends out a response to the effectors. And the effectors then, are going to have some type or response which changes the stimulus. Most often, it removes it. And that would be then a negative feedback loop. And the response coming out from the integration center is going to be our efferent path.  
* So, let's look at one of these reflex loops.  
* So, this is one where we have an external change. So, the stimulus is simply that my body is normally at 37 degrees. And I go outside and it is snowing. And I have no coat, it's cold, it's 30 degrees outside. And my body then starts to lose heat. And as my body temperature is falling, it can fall to 34 degrees Centigrade. That means that the stimulus that is coming into the thermal receptors, which are located on your skin and within the core, so that they are actually sensing how warm the blood is within the core of your body. Those are the central thermal sensors. They start to send the signal to the integration center in the hypothalamus, which is a specific region of your brain. The hypothalamus set point is 37 degrees but the input is 34. So, the hypothalamus says, “This body is cold,” and now it sets out a response. The response to the effectors, and one major effector is skeletal muscle.  
* What happens? You are standing out in the cold and you start to shiver. And as you are shivering, you are generating heat. You are generating heat by contracting and relaxing and contracting and relaxing the skeletal muscles. You also are going to vasoconstrict all of the blood that is within the skin to a lower, more closer, central location of the skin so that you do not lose as much heat radiating off from the surface of the skin. So, we are then going to be conserving heat. And then what else do you do? You curl up, right? You get smaller and you get smaller by reducing your surface area. And by reducing the surface area , you lose less heat from the body., okay? So, you have three major responses. And each of those responses is actually going to increase heat.  
* So, as we are increasing heat or retaining heat, then we are able then to bring our body temperature from 34 closer to 37. The other thing is, you could go inside or you could put on a coat, or you could put on a sweater, okay? But you're, but basically, the body is trying to retain heat. It's trying to minimize the loss of heat. So, that's due to its response to its external change.  
* What happens if we have an internal change? You get sick. You have an infection. And that infection is going to set off macrophages, which are a cell type of your body to secrete pyrogens. These pyrogens actually reset the set point in the hypothalamus. They set the set point now to 40 degrees Centigrade, instead of 37, which is our normal temperature. Now, the body is recieving signals from the periphial sensors and the central sensors saying that the body is at 37 and it thinks the body is cold. What does it do? It is sends out a signal to the effectors, this is an effarent pathway, again, what are effectors? Muscle, skeleton muscle. We start shivering. We have vasoconstriction within the skin so that we stop losing so much body heat out, radiating out from our surface. And what do you do? You curl up, you put on a blanket, you're shivering, you have fever, right? All of the same responses that we had when we had an external change to the body is exactly the same responses. The difference is what is the initiating signal? And the initiating signal, in this case, is that we have reset the set point. By resetting the set point, the body now is tricked into thinking it's cold.  
* So, we have then these mechanisms to control how the body is going to respond to changes, both external changes and internal changes. And the dominant one of these reflexes is going to be a negative feedbacks. We're going to see negative feedbacks over and over again as we go through all of the organ systems of the body.  
* We can have simple negative reflexes, negative feedbacks, where we have a stimulus, such as we just ate our Big Mac. Glucose goes up in the blood. And as glucose goes up in the blood, it's going to cause the pancreatic beta cell to secrete insulin. Pancreatic beta cells secretes insulin, and this insulin then is going to cause the muscle cell, which is the target, to take up the glucose. It removes the glucose form the blood and now, the glucose levels then fall in the circulation. So, that's our negative feedback. We had high glucose as our initiating stimulus the insulin causes the glucose to move into the muscle cell and so that decreases the glucose within the blood and that's our negative feedback, simple negative feedback.  
* As we go through the endocrine system, we'll see that we can also have very complex negative feedback, and here, we can have a series of cells which are regulating the distal cell.  
* So we can have stimulus coming into the first cell, which secretes a chemical, a hormone, hormone A and that causes a second cell, B, to secrete another chemical, B. It acts on cell C, and that acts on a distal cell to give us are response. The thyroid hormone is regulated in such a manner. So, we have the hypothalamus, which is our brain, the stimulus is the temperature of the body. The temperature of the body is too cold. The hypothalamus receives that information. And it then causes us to secrete a hormone from the hypothalamus, which then causes a hormone to be secreted by the pituitary. And that hormone works on the thyroid gland to increase thyroid hormone within the circulatory system. Thyroid hormone works on all cells of the body. And it changes the metabolism of all cells of the body. It revs up metabolism and generates heat. And in particular, one of its target sites is skeletal muscle. So, it is generating heat through skeletal muscle. So, those are our negative feedbacks.  
* But we also have positive feedbacks. And positive feedbacks are where the cell will receive a signal, say, from an endocrine cell. The target cell receives the signal, and that causes it to increase the number of receptors its cell surface. It makes it very sensitive to the signal. The other way you can get a positive feedback is that the cell receives the hormone and that hormone causes the target cell to secrete something that makes more of the hormone. So, we have a positive feedback on the system.  
* The blood clotting cascade is actually a positive feedback. When you cut yourself, you will start to form a clot, and that is a very rapid cascade, and that cascade makes it go faster and faster and faster, and then, you form clots faster and faster and faster. But if we let that go, we would have our entire cardiovascular system clotted. Okay. Thats not a good idea. So, what we need to do is we have to always limit positive feedbacks.  
* Positive feedbacks are always limited by negative feedback. You have to turn off the positive feedback. Otherwise, it accelerates and accelerates and accelerates.  
  
**Tonic Controls**  
  
* So, we have a couple of other controls and these are not controls where we turn on or turn off a mechanism. Now, tonic control is what we use to control blood vessels. Your normal state of contraction of the blood vessel is that it is something like this. Now, I can cause the blood vessel to dilate so that its lumen gets bigger. Or I can cause the blood vessel to constrict so that its lumen gets smaller. And I do so by the input from the sympathetic nervous system.  
* Increased input from the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction, so we constrict the blood vessel. And if we decrease the sympathetic nervous system input, then we actually dilate. So, we never actually turn something on or off under this mechanism, but we can modulate the actual luminal size of the blood vessels and we do so by changing the input from the nervous system. It is sort of like a radio where I can turn my volume up and I can turn my volume down, but I don't ever turn the volume off. And this is different from antagonistic control.  
* Antagonistic control, we are going to see in the cardiovascular system, and here in particularly on the heart. Your heart has an intrinsic beat of 100 beats per minute. If you add a deinervated heart, you just transplant the heart from, from June over to Jon, that heart is going to beat at 100 beats per minute. It has no nerve nervous innervation. With parasympathetic innervation, we can slow, the heart rate, so we slow the heart rate. Athletes such as Lance Armstrong have a heart rate of 45. Normal heart rate is around 80. He has a heart rate of 45. Okay. Well-trained athletes have very high parasympathetic tone. And when we talk about the cardiovascular system, we will explain why that is very important.  
* In a sympathetic system, if we use the sympathetic system, we actually increase heart rate. So, the sympathetic system is like the gas paddle. That's the thing that you use when you want to go running. You have to increase cardiac output so that you can move blood faster to the tissues so you can give the oxygen to the skeletal muscle faster. So, to increase heart rate, we have the sympathetics. To decrease heart rate, we have the parasympathetics. We have the break parasympathetic, we have the gas paddle sympathetic.  
* It is the net effect of these two inputs that determines your actual heart rate.  
* And then, there is one last idea. And this you all are fairly familiar with, and that is the circadian rhythms. These are simply that things in your body change on a 24-hour basis without you ever thinking about it. When you go to sleep at night, your body temperature falls at about one degree. And when you wake up, it goes back up one degree. So then, as you are sleeping, temperature is lower.  
* But other things in your body are also on circadian rhythms. And notably, you have an increase in growth hormone during early sleep. And you have an increase in cortisol just as you wake up. What is happening is that these two hormones, cortisol and growth hormone, are actually they are an integrated system. Growth hormone is coming on because the body has not had food for quite a while. and now, the empty stomach is turning on growth hormone. Growth hormone comes on and mobilizes glucose. And then, in the early morning hours, cortisol is coming on. And cortisol is actually mobilizing even more glucose and that glucose that is being mobilized actually shuts off growth hormone.  
* So, do we ever know about this? Are you familiar with this? Of course. How many of you are, are night owls? What does that mean? It means you're up all night. You're perky. But 8:00 in the morning is really hard, right? When you get up at 8:00 in the morning, you're feeling cold, you can't quite find your shoes, you're looking all around for your shoes, and you wonder where is that coffee. It's difficult. What's with the early birds? Early birds, perky. Okay, 5:00 in the morning. Boom. They're up. They're running around. They've got lots of energy. They're hot. Okay, ready to go. The difference is their circadian rhythms. You're both perfectly normal people. But one of them has a circadian rhythm that's set for late night activity, and the other has a circadian rhythm that's set for early morning.  
* Now, what happens when you travel? You travel to London and you have a time shift. And now, you're not feeling quite the same as you normally are early in the morning, right? And it takes you 24 hours, sometimes 72 hours, before you feel normal again. What's happened? You have changed your circadian rhythm. And now, you actually have to reset the set point. So, the set point becomes reset to London time. And it takes a little while for the body to reset that. But what resets it and what sets your circadian rhythms is sleep wake. It is not dark night, okay? Dark light. So, it's excuse me. So, it is sleep wake, okay, that is going to reset your circadian rhythms and everyone has the circadian rhythms.  
* So, what are our general concepts then? So, we have stability if these internal variables, it is going to be achieved by balancing our inputs and our outputs to the body and among all the organs systems.  
* In our negative feedback system, we have a change in the variable, it is corrected by bringing the body back to its initial set point and, but remember, that the set points can be reset. And remember also, that it is not always possible to maintain everything relatively constant.  
* There is a hierarchy and importance in the maintenance of life. The brain and the heart win, always. And they will cause the rest of the body to be sacrificed but they will get their blood always, okay?  
* So, there is going to be, as we go through this organ systems, you will see that there is a hierarchy in what must be maintained even at the risk of losing a few organs. So, next time when we come back, we're going to talk about, more about regulation. And we're going to talk about how we move information across the plasma membrane. See you then.

#  1-3 Homeostasis - Transporters, Pumps, and Channels  
  
So one of the major concepts in Physiology is how we set up gradiance, cause gradiance is how we move in materials from one from one compartment into another compartment. So it's extremely important to understand then how solutes are able to cross these semi-permeable barriers, or effectively impermeable barriers, that is to enter into exit cells. And we also want to look at how, not only how we do accomplish this, but that why this is so terribly important.  
  
**Importance of Pumps, Transporters and Channels**  
  
* So the importance of these of things called pumps, transporters, and channels is that these are actually the basis for the physiological processes.  
* We use transporters, channels and pumps for growth, for maintenance of life for the cell. All cells have a sodium potassium ATPase, and that's how we maintain that balance of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane.  
* We also are using these pumps, channels and transporters for metabolic activities and for sensory perception. All of the nervous system is actually gonna be using channels an moving ions across the membranes. And this is going to be how they encode information from the sensory receptor that is sitting down here where I tickle my finger to my brain which is receiving the input and then how it interprets this tickle in my finger.  
* Also these are the basis for disease. Defective transporters are what underlies many, many diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis. In Cystic Fibrosis, we actually have a chloride channel. The chloride channel is not functioning correctly, and because it is not functioning correctly, water is not distributing correctly from one compartment to the other. You get very thick mucus, this very thick material within the ducts from the pancreas, within the lungs, people cannot breath, people are not able to excrete their, their enzymes and deliver them to the GI tract.  
* You also have defective channels. When we see these in muscle problems. So, for instance, the Long QT syndrome. This is actually a heart defect where the individual will actually go into an arrhythmia, or we can have muscle paralysis.  
* Also, these pumps, transporters and channels are the basis of therapies.  
* For treatment of hypertension we use diuretics. Diuretics block the, the actual transport of sodium and by blocking the transport of sodium within the kidney, you are then causing water to stay within the renal tubules and so we increase pee, we increase our urine output. That decreases the volume within the body and by decreasing volume in the body, pressure decreases within the body. And so this is the first line of approach then to treating hypertension.  
* And we also use these inhibitors of pumps when we are treating stomach ulcers. You all are aware of the little purple pill, little Nexium. Okay, Nexium is a proton pump inhibitor. It inhibits the movement of potass of protons into the stomach lumen. You cannot make acid if you don't have this movement of protons into the stomach. So this proton pump inhibitor then, is able to change the pH, that is how much of the acid is being made in the stomach and that allows you then to cure the ulcers. So, as we go through this then, we are going to see that all of these proton pumps and transporters are extremely important for the activities of the cells.  
  
**Membrane Transport**  
  
* So let's look at the very beginning. At how we move materials from one compartment to the other.  
* And the first is the simplest, and that is simple diffusion. So for simple diffusion, if we have two compartments, compartment one and compartment two and they have between them a permeable barrier, so that this is now a permeable membrane to the material, this orange material that's over in compartment one. That means that the diffusion gradient is such that there's more material of orange in one than there is in two, and now that material is going to move down as concentration gradient into two. So there is a very large movement, then, of the orange material into compartment two. We have a very small movement, of the orange material, then, going back into whe re it is high concentration. So the orange material is able to go across this. We can have very small movement then, going in the opposite direction. That means then that our flux, that is the net flux, is going to be determined by the gradients, and that flux is going to be always across a surface per unit time and it's going to be always from a high concentration to a low concentration.  
* We use this when we are talking about the gap junctions. So remember what I told you cardiac muscle cells are coupled through gap junctions, and if we have high calcium in cell one, that calcium will diffuse into cell two and raise the calcium in cell two. The diffusion will occur until we actually come to an equilibrium.  
* So the characteristics of simple diffusion, is it's always gonna move from a high to a low concentration and it requires no energy expenditure and it's gonna continue until there's an equilibrium is reached between the compartments.  
* It will occur very rapidly over short distances but very slowly after long distances which is why we need to have the circulatory system for actually moving materials within the body. So diffusion is going to be occurring between the blood vessels and the cells at a very local level.  
* Diffusion is directly related to temperature. The higher the temperature the faster the movement of the molecules the faster the diffusion and it's inversely related to the size of the molecules. The big molecules are slow to move, small molecules faster to move. And also is dependent on the total surface area and the thickness of the membrane barrier. So we have a larger surface area, we get more diffusion. Smaller surface area, less diffusion. It's very, very obvious.  
* So in contrast to simple diffusion, we have what is known as facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion allows hydrophobic molecules to move across the membrane. The membranes are made up of bilayers of lipids, and so anything soluble in hydrophobic materials, that are soluble in lipids can move directly acro ss by simple diffusion. But ions such as sodium cannot move across these bilayers, and they need to have some channel or some opening which will allow them to get across. One way that they do so is called facilitated diffusion, and in facilitated diffusion, we have a protein, which is inserted within the plasma membrane. This protein is open to, for instance in this case, the external cell fluid compartment and it can load something like glucose. Glucose enters into this transporter and then the transporter like this little basket flips and it dumps the glucose then to the interior of the cell.  
* The movement of the material from one side of the membrane to the other is going to be determined by gradient. So the side that has the highest concentration, in this case of glucose, then more glucose is going to be moved into the interior of the cell than what is actually leaving the cell, and going back out to the outside. So this is facilitated diffusion.  
* If we compare, simple diffusion versus facilitated diffusion, what we see is the flux. This is the transport of the material, versus the solute concentration which is increasing in this direction. Then we see that with simple diffusion, that as we increase the amount of materials, then the, the transport is increasing in a linear fashion. And that we have no maximum that's reached within this, it's completely governed by the increase in concentration.  
* This is in contrast to facilitated diffusion where here we have finite number of these transporters, and because we have finite number of the transporters we can actually saturate the number of transporters. When we saturate the number of transporters, we then have maximal transport. So we have maximal transport of the material and is also called the threshold fo the solute. If we increase the solute concentration beyond threshold, we will not increase the transport rate. The transport rate is set and we now have an isotope for the transport rate.  
* There are also transporters, which are going to allow us to move more than one material at a time, these are called cotransporters, and the cotransporter that's diagramed here, it's called a symporter, because it moves sodium and glucose in the same direction across the plasma membrane. When we're moving materials across the plasma membrane the same direction then, this symporter needs to have both the sodium and the glucose present for activity of the symporter.  
* One of the major symporters that we have in the body is actually found in the intestinal tract and this is the sodium glucose transporter, it's call the SGLT. The SGLT, once it was discovered, is actually extremely important for not only moving sodium and glucose across this area, but it allows us to move water across these membranes, across the cells, and into the body. And it is actually used by physicians for individuals who have cholera where they're losing liters and liters of fluid in diarrhea. This is the way that they actually are, giving them back the water in a very rapid manner by driving, this SGLT. And we'll talk about the movement of water in the next, in the next lecture.  
* In addition to symporters, we also have antiporters. An antiporters for instance, we have in the kidneys, an antiporter, which is moving sodium into the cell and moving a proton out of the cell. And so when we do the renal tubules, we're going to be talking about the movement of ions across these membranes and the importance of moving these ions across the membranes and how it affects the movement of water.  
* What's important to remember about all of these transporters is that they have specificity and that they can be saturated. Because there's a finite number of them and so you can reach maximum transport rate, they can be saturated.  
* Now, in contrast to the transporters, which are only open partially on one side of the membrane or on the other, we have channels.  
  
**Channels**  
  
* Channels are actually patent holes that go across the plasma membrane. They actually make an aqueous channel or aqueous opening across the plasma membrane when they're open. The channels that we know of are aquaporins, and the aquaporins are water channels. The aquaporins are going to allow water to move very rapidly across essentially every plasma membrane in your body.  
* There are two exceptions, and that's going to be in the kidney. And we'll talk about it when we're in the kidney. But there, the aquaporin channels, are going to be these patent holes which are allowing water to flow from one side of the membrane to the other. We'll also have channels which are gated, that means that they are closed and they, and their opening is regulated. The opening, or the regulation of the channel, is called the gating of the channel. So it's regulation is gating. These channels are, again, once they're open, movement is going to go from high concentration to low concentration, because we're opening a patent hole, and the diffusion through the channel, is going to be from high to low. The channels can be gated in many different ways, one of them is the ligand gating. For instance, this is where we binded a chemical, a ligand, to the channel and it opens the channel.  
* One of the major channels that work this way, is the nicotinic receptor which sits on the skeletal muscle. It actually has for its ligand acetylcholine. That's the chemical. The nerves secretes acetylcholine (that's our neurotransmitter), it binds to this channel, and it opens the channel and sodium enters the cells.  
* A second type of channel is the voltage-gated channel, and here we have a charge difference across the plasma membrane. And that charge difference actually controls whether or not the channels are gonna to be opened or closed. So we can have, for instance, the calcium-type channels, especially in the heart. We're going to be talking a lot about calcium type channels. And these channels will open at a certain voltage, and then they're gonna close at a certain voltage. We have voltage- gated potassium channels that open at a certain voltage and close at a certain voltage.  
* And then thirdly we have mechanically-gated channels and then these channels require tension to open. This we see mostly in smooth muscles. So in smooth muscles, if you have smooth muscle, and you fill the blood vessel with more blood than normal, you will stretch the plasma membrane of the smooth muscle cells, and that opens a mechanically-gated calcium channel. Calcium enters causes the cells to then contract and you then will regain the same luminal size in the smooth muscle that surrounds the blood vessel.   
  
**Pumps**  
  
*  And thirdly then we have our pumps. Now the pumps, in contrast to the transporters and to simple diffusion, require energy. The pumps are actually ATPases. They are enzymes. And so they're actually going to cleave an ATP in order to be able to move material from one side to the other.  
* The pumps are gonna move materials from a low concentration to a high concentration and as I say, they're gonna have to use energy in order to do this. So a pump is what we see here. So on the ECF we have three molecules and let's say these are calcium. So then, the little green squares then are our calcium ions, and we have only one calcium ion on the inside. The ATP is the calcium ATPases is in an inactive state. Once it binds ATP, it also binds the calcium and under this configuration then, it's going to change it's configuration, or confirmation, and allow the calcium then, to move to the opposite side. If you notice that the calcium is going against the concentration gradient. It's going from a very low concentration to a high concentration. It's the opposite of what we saw with simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion.  
* When the confirmation change occurs, we actually are splitting the ATP, then the ATP will come off from the channel, the channel will then rejoin its original configuration and then it's reset again for the next event.  
* Many of these pumps are extremely important. One of course is our sodium potassium ATPase which maintains a very high concentration of potassium on the interior of the cell and a low potassium on the outside, and a high sodium on the outside, and a low sodium on the inside. But we also have these calcium ATPase's which are used for, for allowing us to store calcium and an organelle that is a membrane bound sac which is sitting within cells so that we could then release it and use it as a signaling molecule within the cell. And we're going, when we talk about muscle and other, and other organs within, within the, the body, we're going to be talking about these active transports, or these pumps.  
  
**General Concepts**  
  
* Okay, so what's our general concepts then?   
* So the movement of a solute across a lipid bilayer is going to be dependent upon the size, its charge, and the solubility.  
* We have a net flux or net movements is going be determined by gradients.  
* We are going from high concentrations to low concentrations when we are dealing with diffusion. Movements of non-permeable solutes across lipid bilayers, that is, the membranes are going to be dependent then on our gradients. It's gonna be dependent on whether or not we're using simple diffusion whether or not we're using facilitated diffusion or we're using active transport.  
* And then remember that active transport is going to be moving the solutes against their concentration gradient, and in order to do this, it requires energy. It requires the use of ATP.  
* But in all cases, the transporters, the channels, and the pumps are always gonna have specificity and saturation of the transporters, or the channels, or the pumps.  
* So the next time we come in here again we're going to talk some more about the use of these materials and how we move materials across these channels, transporters and pumps to move materials not only into a cell but across the cells and also for the movement of water.

#  1-4 Homeostasis - Solute and Water Transport  
  
So today, we are going talk some more about transport of materials across membranes, but in particular, we want to do a couple things. One is we want to talk about how we move materials from a luminal surface, that is one side of a cell, to the opposite side of the cell, and release it to the, to the blood. And this is particularly important when we're going be talking about the GI tract because this is how we are going to get foods, nutrients, salt, water and so forth, from the GI tract into the body and into the blood, so that we can actually deliver it to other organs of the body. And it is going to be very important when we are talking about the urinary system, because this is how we are going to be moving ions back into the body. We are going to filter blood, and then we have to move a lot of our ions back into our body, and a lot of the water back into the body. We do not want to lose all of that in urine. You will actually filter something like 180 liters per day of blood, but you only put out a half liter to a liter of pee. So all of that extra fluid, and all of the ions that you are filtering,, you are actually moving them back into the body because it is an extremely important mechanism. And it is a little difficult to understand. So we are going to talk about this today, first, and then we are going to talk about the actual movement of water.  
  
**Transcellular Transport**
  
* So transcellular transport means that we are going to move across a cell. So when we move across the cell, and that is what diagrammed here, we have here a kidney cell. So we have the lumen will be where we would have our urine. So the urine would be here, and this is now a filtrate of the blood. So, this is going to be water, ions, glucose, and so forth that we have filtered and it is now sitting in this little lumen of a tubule. So it is inside of a tube. We want to be able to move those ions back across the cell, so we are going to move it across this epithelial cell, which is a renal epithelial cell, into the blood. So that we then are saving all the water and all these ions and moving them back into the body.  
* The way we do this is that we have a transporter, a symporter, on the luminal surfaces of these cells. So these cells are going to have different types of transporters on one surface than they have on the other surface, so they are going to be asymmetrical cells.  
* For instance, we have here a sodium glucose transporter, and remember these are our symporters so we are going to co-transport sodium and glucose across these cells. The glucose, and the sodium will enter into the cell. And then once they are inside the cell, the glucose will exit the cell. On the basal surface. So this is our basal surface, and the basal surface faces the blood. That's our capillary. So, the glucose then will enter the cell, diffuse across the cell, an then leave by a transporter. This is a simple transporter, facilitated diffusion at the basal surface, and that glucose then enters into the blood. The sodium, when it enters into the cell, then, will be pumped by the sodium potassium ATPAs out of the cell. And that sodium potassium ATPAs always pumps three sodiums for every two potassiums which are entering the cell. And we do not build up a lot of extras, a lot of intracellular potassium, because potassium, in all cells, has a little leak. So there is always a little leak out of potassium out of these cells at the base, at this basal surface.  
* The key here is the sodium that is entering. We are sort of piggybacking on the sodium gradient. So it really does not matter how much glucose is in these cells. What is really important is how much sodium. And the sodium, as it enters into the cells, is kept at a low concentration in the cells because of our sodium potassium ATPA's, which are actively pumping it out of the cell. So we maintain our diffusion gradient high sodium on the outside in the limit, low sodium in the inside of the cell. And so we always have a concentration gradient for sodium. Excuse me. And the glucose is entering. The glucose will also have a high concentration because there is very little glucose sitting out here in the interstitial space. So, in the interstitial space we do not have much glucose.  
* So again, our diffusion, our facilitated diffusion gradient is going to allow the glucose to leave the cells, enter into the interstitial space, and then into the blood. This is called secondary active transport. So a secondary active transport because we are using the sodium-potassium ATPAs on the basal surface, but we are linking it to, a code transporter, an actual symporter, on the luminal surface. So this is the secondary active transporter, and it is allowing the movement then, of both sodium and glucose across the cells and back into the blood.  
* Now as we are moving that sodium across these cells, we are also setting up a gradient for water. Remember, as water comes into a compartment, sodium comes into a compartment. It attracts water. It is an effective solute, and so the water is going to follow the sodium and water is able to move across these cells through the aquaporin channels. And so, we actually have a diffusion of water that follows the sodium into the blood.  
* So, we are moving the salts across, we are moving nutrients across and, more importantly, we are moving water across at this area. Secondary active transport.   
  
**Movement of Water**    
* Okay. So, what about this water?  
* Alright. So I am going to talk for the rest of this the rest of this period about the movement of water, and how important the movement of water is in the body. So the first thing that we're gonna talk about, and this is, again, this is a little counter-intuitive.  
* The most concentrated water is pure water (water that has no solutes in it). That is the most concentrated water. And when you think of a solution, you always think, or most people think about the solute that is in the solution. If I tell you I have a 1 molar sodium chloride solution. I have a lot of sodium in that solution. One molar of sodium i's in that solution. But if I tell you I have a 0.1 of a molar sodium solution, I actually have, still I have sodium in the solution, but I have more water in the 0.1 molar sodium chloride solution, than I have in the 1 molar chloride sodium solution. So it is sort of a little not intuitive. And as I say this, you are going to sit here going, but as we go through this, okay, you'll see that it's not always intuitive, okay. So, the very first thing to remember is high concentration of water is pure water. If I add a solute, I decrease the concentration of the water. I increase the concentration of the solute, but I decrease the concentration of the water, okay?  
* Alright, now, water is so important, it actually has its own special name for the movement of water and it is called osmosis. It is the term that is used only for the movement of water, and water is going to move by diffusion. But for many years, we thought water just diffused across membranes even though it was polar, and that it got across membranes. But it turns out that it has a channel, and that channel is the aquaporin channel. So an aquaporin is an open channel which allows water to move across plasma membranes. And actually, Peter Agre, who used to be at Duke and is now at Johns Hopkins, got the Nobel Prize for discovering the aquaporin channels. So the aquaporin channels are present in all cells of the body. So osmosis is going to be our movement of water from one compartment to another, and it is by diffusion.  
* So let's look at their illustration here. So we have one cell which is sitting here, and it has a little bit of sodium. It has 2 sodiums in it. And we have a second cell, which has 4. The cell that has the most water is this one, right. So this is the most water when I compare these two cells. So this is number one and this is number two. So the most water is in cell number one.  
* Now, if I put these two cells together, and I now allow their membranes to allow sodium to move and water to move, and I allow them to go into equilibrium, what will happen is that we will end up with an equal size to the compartments, and an equal number of sodiums in each compartment, and an equal number of water molecules in each compartment. They will. Both the sodium will diffuse and the water will diffuse, and we will have equal amounts so this is actually should be three and three, if I am going to be correct with my math. Okay. So we have three sodiums and three sodiums, and we have water which is following the sodiums and so we're going to equalize water and sodium. That's if we're permeable to both the water and to the solute, which is our sodium.   
* Now what happens when we do not allow the sodium to go across the membrane? If we do not allow the sodium to go across the membrane, but we allow water to move across the membrane, then water is going to move from the first compartment, compartment one, to compartment two. And as it moves from compartment to compartment two, it is because it is now going to dilute down the concentration of sodium that is in compartment two. And if you notice, compartment two got bigger. We have increased the size of compartment two.  
* So the diffusion then of water (osmosis), caused the change in the compartment size, when the membrane is impermeable to the solute. Now then, you all know that the cells of the body are impermeable to solutes. Right? So water is going to move across these membranes, and it is going to move in everywhere in the body, to equalize sodium concentrations, of the potassium concentrations, or total solute concentrations in the two compartments. And this is a key point, okay.  
* So what happens is if I dilute down the ECF of your body. Normally, the ECF and the ICF are going to have the same concentrations of solutes and water. If I add a whole lot of water to the ECF, then what will happen? Water will move from the ECF to the ICF, and when it does so, the cells are going to swell. And when the cells swell, the part of your body that is not going to be happy is your brain because it is encased in a body cranium. And then you start to swell the neurons, they're going to get squished. Okay, very unhappy, headache and death. So this is not a good scenario. So the body going to want to maintain, okay, these balances between the compartments.  
* So osmosis is going to be the movement of water. It occurs by diffusion, and it is by facilitated diffusion because we have our aquaporin channels. And it has the highest concentration of water. When we have pure water. Excuse me.   
  
**Terms to Remember**  
  
    Important Terms
    Molarity = # mole/vol (where 1 mole = 6 x 1023 molecules).  
    Osmolarity = (# molecule/vol) x (# particles/molecule).  
    Osmolality = (# molecule/Kg water) x (# particles/molecule).  
    In body, osmolarity ~ osmolality = 300 mOsM.  
    Consider ALL molecules to calculate osmolarity!  

* Okay, so, important terms to remember. This is your chemistry class, okay, so important terms to remember. Molarityis the number of moles per volume, but osmolarity is the number of molecules per volume times the number of particles per molecule. So, in osmolarity then, we have to consider how many particles, not just the moles of particles, but the number of particles within the mole. So, if I am talking about one molar of glucose, one molar glucose is equal to one osmolar glucose, because glucose is a single, particle. But if I am talking about one molar of sodium chloride, sodium chloride can dissociate into sodium ions and into chloride ions, so it has two particles. So now I am talking about a 2 osmolar solution of sodium and chloride. Okay. So, the osmolarity then, always has to deal with the number of particles, and we are very interested in the number of particles that cannot move across the plasma membranes. These are the effective solutes because they determine how water moves across the plasma membranes.  
* There is one other term to remember, and that is osmolarity and osmolality, and in the body our osmolality and osmolarity, the osmolarity is essentially the same. So we do not really worry about, this is one liter versus one kilogram. So we don't really worry about the distinction between osmolarity and osmolality. In the body, then, we are going to consider the cells in this course to be 300 miliosmals. To be completely correct is 295, but that's an uncommon, I mean that is an unweiding number to deal with, and so w e're gonna just always talk about the cells as 300 milliosmos, and you always have to consider all of the molecules, whether they are lipid soluble or not lipid soluble when you are talking about osmolarity.  
* So you count up all the molecules (all the particles) that are within the solution. but when we are talking of tonicity, we are only going to be talking about the non-penetrating particles. So the non-penetrating particles, because this urea, for instance, can go across the plasma membrane, and it will form an equilibrium, and so water will not follow urea. But, sodium, we said, has a difficult time getting across the plasma membrane. So, water follows sodium. Okay? So when, when we are dealing with tonicity, then we are going to be dealing with the non-penetrating or the effective solutes.  
* So, look at our diagrams. So we start off, we have a little red blood cell, and he's sitting in a solution, and the solution is 300 milliosmoles. The cell itself is 300 milliosmoles. The cell is sitting there and he is very happy.  
* I then dump water into the solution, and when I do so, I dilute down the solution. So there is now less than 300 milliosmoles. What happens? Water enters into the red blood cell, the red blood cell swells, and that is what we see here. So we get swelling of the cell as water is entering across the plasma membrane. If I take this red blood cell and I actually move them into a solution that is concentrated above 300 milliosmols, the cell shrinks. It gets crenulate, smaller size, okay, and it is shrinking because it is losing water. Water is leaving the cell and going out into the solution, okay.  
* So remember water can move across these membranes, and it does so, it is dictated by these solutes, which are within the solution surrounding it, or within itself. Tonicity is always comparative. So if I have a solution where the solution is the same as the as the osmolarity of the cell, then the solution is called isotonic. If the solution is less than the solution of the cell, it is called hypotonic, and if the solution is greater than the cell, then it is hypertonic. And these terms actually also apply when we are talking about osmolarity.  
* So if I have a solution were the solution is 300 milliosmoles, This is going to be isoosmotic. If  it is less than 300, then the solution is going to be hypoosmotic. And if the solution is greater than 300, then its going to be hyperosmotic.  
* Okay, so iso-, hypo-, and hyper- apply in both conditions. Alright, so let's just go through some examples of how this works. So our condition is that we have isotonic saline which is being infused into the body by, by intravascular needle. So an isotonic solution. Isotonic means it is going to have the same osmolarity as the cells. Right, so it is going to be 300 milliosmoles. So our effect on the ECF osmolarity is no effect. So there is no change in the osmolarity of the ECF, it is isotonic. Total body water is going to increase. We are adding more fluid to the body, so we are giving an injection of saline, and as we are doing so, we are increasing the volume of the body.  
* What happens to the ECF? Will the ECF increase, decrease, or stay the same? The ECF obviously is going to increase, right? Because the intravascular space is where we are actually adding this sodium chloride, right? We are actually adding it into the intravascular space as part of the ECF. ECF volume increases.  
* Will ICF volume changge? No, why? Because there is no gradient that we have established for moving water from the cells in to the ECF. The ECF is 300 milliosmoles, we add more 300 milliosmoles, it is still the same concentration. There is no gradient change than for water to leave the cells and go into the ECF.   
  
* So I am going to go ahead and let you going, go through this and you work it through on your own and then you can see just how it effects, different conditions will actually affect the body.So for instance we can have an isotonic loss of fluid which is in diarrhea. So you are having fluid loss from the body, but it is isotonic. Total body water decreases; osmolarity of the ECF does not change.  
* So the question then is, what happens to the ECF and the ICF? And I'm going to let you go ahead and work it through. Also, have this condition where we have excess sodium chloride intake. No water coming in with it. And so, what happens is we have an increase in the ECF osmolarity. We are not changing total body water.  
* So what happens to the body waters between the ECF and the ICF? I'm increasing the osmolarity of the ECF. If I do that, all of the sodium is gonna stay in the ECF. If all the sodium stays in the ECF, then the volume of the ECF must increase and the volume of the ICF decrease, because water's gonna move from the ICF to the ECF to balance the concentration of sodium. And then I will let you work through the last one, which is the hypotonic loss.   

**General Concepts**  
  
* Transcellular movement is by secondary active transport.  
* We have two fluid compartments of the body, the ECF an the ICF, and these are going to be in osmotic balance.  
* Water is going to move by simple diffusion in a process called osmosis, and the water will move depending upon the osmolarity of the compartments.  
* The cellular volume is critically dependent on the steady state movement of solutes and water across the plasma membrane, in exchange with the ECF.  
* The cells are going to swell when we have a hypotonic condition in the ECF, and the cells are gonna shrink when we have a hypertonic condition in the ECF. And this is going to have major effects for instance, on the neurons of the body.  
* So if we have a situation where we said they have swelling, either we can crush the neurons of within the cranium, and we have a condition where we have shrinkage. Then we will pull on all of the blood vessels within the cranium which are attached within the bony cranium, then when you pull them, that we could tear them, you can have a stroke. So it has major implications as to what happens with, especially within, within the brain when we're changing these volumes across the membranes.

# 1-5 Endocrine System - Endocrine Concepts: Chemical Characteristics  
  
* So today, we are going to talk about the endocrine system. And this is one of our major reflex loops which is going to communicate all of the cells of the body. So we are going to generate a signal (a stimulus) at one point. And that is going to be received by this endocrine cell. It will secrete a, a chemical, a hormone, into the blood, and that is going to be delivered then to the target cells and we will get a response. Which is going to either eliminate the originating signal, or actually increase it. So the two major reflex loops of the body are, in fact, due to the nervous system and to the endocrine system.  
* So in the nervous system, we have a situation where the cell, the neuron, is secreting into a very small space, and that space is called a synapse. And it is actually going to be secreting its chemicals into this space at very high concentration. So, we have high concentrations of the neurotransmitters, or this chemical, that is then going to be received by the effector cell, and that effector cell gives us our stimulus.  
* Because we have very high concentrations of the neurotransmitter, we then have to have low affinity receptors on the receiving cell. So these cells,then, have low affinity receptors. And these are critical that they have low affinity because the neurotransmitter binds to these cells, and then is released quickly. So we get the second stimulus and the third stimulus and so forth.  
* But this is different from the endocrine system. Where in the endocrine system we are going to be secreting our chemical (our hormone) into the blood, and this is going to dilute our hormone into very low concentrations. So, we have low concentrations of hormone, and at those low concentrations of hormone are then going to be targeting to specific cells that have receptor for that hormone and these receptors are going to have high affinity. So when they bind to the hormone or the hormone binds to these receptors, it stays on the receptors a bit longer than what we saw with the nervous system. So the nervous system is for fast commuication. We're going to have ion flows. And then very quick on off of our chemicals at our synapses. But in the ~~interconsistent~~ we are going to have a much slower response. We are going to have to deliver our chemicals through the blood. And then it ss going to be binding to these receptors. The cells that have receptors are called the target cells.  
* So the other point that we have to remember about the endocrine system is that these are glands. So the endocrine glands then, are going to be ductless glands. They are secreting their hormones (their chemicals) directly into the blood. They are not secreting it into a duct, what then takes it to another lumen. The second thing about them is that they are going to be doing all of the homeostatic missions that are in the body. So they are going to be regulating our sodium and water balance. They are going to be regulating our calcium balance, our energy balance, our processes that cope with stress, and are growth in development and reproduction. So, they are going to be essentially regulating all the processes of the body, and they are going to be integrating all the organ systems of the body.  
* Because they are delivered through the blood, the concentration of these hormones is really critical. So when we have too little hormone, we do not have enough receptors activated, and we have an insufficient response. If we have too high of hormones, then we have way too much, an excess response, or our receptors can actually down regulate, so that they actually are not going to be responding, the target cells won't respond to the hormone. So, the concentration of the hormone is going to be very critical, and that is the dominant aspects for the regulation of this system. And that, we're going to see, is going to be mediated by both positive feedback loops and by negative feedback loops.  
* The second thing that we have to think about is our rate of delivery. So this is going to be dependent on the perfusion of the tissues, and the actual blood flow through those tissues. And this is going to follow what we call mass action laws.  
* In many of the hormones that we are dealing with is that some of the hormones are not soluble in plasma and they have to be bound to a carrier. The hormone that is bound to a carrier then is actually going to have to come off of the carrier, become a free hormone and then that free hormone can bind to the receptors So this release of the hormone from its carrier is then and then binding to the receptors is by mass action and that is simply because the receptors have high affinity but the carriers have low affinity. So the hormone is able to be pulled off of the carriers and on to the high affinity receptors which are going to be within the target cells.  
* And the last thing we need to keep in mind is the rate of degradation on the half life of these chemicals. So these chemicals are going to be degraded by the liver or they're excreted by the kidney.  
  
**Classes of Chemicals**  
  
* So there are actually three classes of these chemicals.  
* And in, and it's actually, it helps us if we think of them in chemical classes. Because when we think of them in chemical classes, then it tells us something about how they're going to act in the cells. Where their receptors are located and how the receptors are going to be delivering information to the cells. So the first of these is the peptide or protein hormones and these are usually greater than three amino acids. The second are going to be the steroid derivatized hormones. And these we'll talk about in just a few minutes. But these are more fat soluble, so they're not going to be soluble in plasma. And the third are our peptide hormones. They're actual peptide hormones being that they're just one or two amino acids. Not peptides but amino acid derivatives. So let's look first at the peptide hormones. So the peptide hormones, as I said, are greater than three amino acids. These are going to be, secrete, and be synthesized by the cells as you would synthesize any of the Proteins that you're going to secrete from a cell. So originally, they're going to made on the endoplasmic reticulum. And when they're synthesized on the rough end of the endoplasmic reticulum. They're made as a preprohormone and this is an inactive species. They're then moved from, from the rough end of the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. And when they go to the Golgi, they're then going to be processed. So that we cleave off a part of the hornome, and we now have a prohormone. And in some cases the prohormone is active. But in many cases the prohormone is inactive. And then from the Golgi, we're actually going to package these then into secretory vesicles. So the secretory vesicles are actually going to be stored within the cytoplasm, and we're going to wait for secretic, secretic valve that's actually going to release them from the cells. While they're within the secretory vesicles. Then the prohormone can be cleaved to the active hormone. And we take off another species and now we have the active hormone. So what's an example of this? One of the examples of this is insulin. So insulin is initially made as one large polypeptide chain. And then the insulin excuse me, as it's moved from, into the Golgi, then the insulin as, will be cleaved and we'll eventually have the prohormone. Which is packaged into the secretory vesicle. And the secretory vesicle will cleave the insulin so that we now have insulin, which is active. And we'll have what's called the C-peptide. And for many years, it was not known that the C-peptide actually had biological activity. And we now know that both the C-peptide and the insulin are biologically active species. If this cleavage does not occur correctly, then the insulin's receptor sight. Is blocked. So we, you would be able to detect insulin within the blood. But the, the insulin is not able to bind to its receptor. And there are in fact known diseases where an individual is making this insulin but the cleavage is incorrect. And so therefore, they effectively are diabetic type ones because they don't have an active insulin that's circulating within their blood. So these are the peptide hormones, and these peptide hormones are secreted in these vesicles. There are two signals that are going to release these from the, from the, the endocrine gland. And one signal is arised in the concentration of calcium in the inside of the cell. The second would be if we had a rise in cyclic AMP. So, these two are signals, then. That, within the cell, if they. If we activate a receptor. And either, we have a rise in cyclic AMP or a rise in intracellular calcium. Then these, the insulin, or the, these peptide hormones would actually be secreted into the blood. Now, one other point about these, is, I should make. And that is, is that, since they're soluble in blood. They actually have very short half lives. So their half lives are short. They are, released from the body. That is, they're excreted from the body. And are in, within a few seconds, sometimes to minutes. The second type of hormone that we have are called the steroid hormones, and these are all derivatives of cholesterol. The, the steroid hormones are not soluble in plasma. These are fat, fat derivatives. And the, they all are cholesterol. Which is then made into pregnenolone. And then, from pregnenolone, we make all of these hormones. These hormones are made in the gonads of the male and the female. That is, estrogen in the female, and testosterone in the male. That's the sex hormones. They're made in the adrenal glands of everyone. And this, is that we have aldosterone, cortisol are the dominant ones that are being made from that gland. And thirdly, it's made in the placenta of the pregnant woman. So, and that's pre-, progesterone or estrogen. As I said, these are going to be insoluble in plasma and so, they have to be transported via carrier proteins. And so, it's going to be by mass action that they're delivered to their target cells. These hormones, because they are fat soluble, are synthesized and secreted on demand. So whenever we get a signal that we have to make cortisol, for instance, it takes 30 to 60 minutes before we actually see a rise in cortisol within the, within the plasma. The other interesting thing about these hormones is that they can be converted either to a higher more active form. Such as, testosterone can be converted to dihydrotestosterone, which is sort of the more potent testosterone. And, and this is done by an enzyme, which is 5-alpha reductase. Or we can have a conversion of testosterone, to actually, to estrogen. And this can occur in many tissues of your body and this conversion is actually through an enzyme which is called aromatase. So we have conversion of these hormones from one type of hormone to a second kind of hormone within the target tissues. Now the third thing a, the third type of hormone that we're going to talk about are the amino acid derivatives. And these are usually derivatives of Tyrosine. So they can be Epinephrine. There can be Norepinephrine and Dopamine. That's one part of this. And the one, these three are actually soluble in plasma, and so they have very short half lives, and their not bound to carrier proteins. In contradiction to that, we have another Tyrosine derivative, which is actually an ester linkage of two Tyrosines. And here we have the thyroid hormones. The thyroid hormone, Thyroxine is what's shown here, or T4, are actually insoluble in plasma. So they have to be bound by a carrier. They're delivered by a carrier, and therefore they have long half lives. T4 actually has a half life in the plasma of up to seven days. T4 can be converted in target tissues to its horm, to it's a prohormone is converted to its actual active, more active hormone. T3 in target tissues. So we can convert these hormones from one, one form to another. And we'll talk about this more when we consider the thyroid hormones.
  
**Transport Carriers**  
* Okay so what about these transport carriers.  
* So the transport carriers then as I said extend the half life of the hormone in the blood and we have transport carriers for the thyroid hormones. These are going to increase their half lives up to several days. We have transport carriers for the steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen and they in fact even bind to the same to the same, binding globulone, which is the testosterone estrogen binding globulone. And these have half lives of 60 to 90 minutes. The other thing about the transport carriers is that they sequester the hormone from it's target cell or from it's target receptors. So as long as the hormone is bound to the rec, to this carrier, it cannot activate the receptor. And the receptor for these, for these hormones as we'll see in a few minutes is actually inside the target cells. And so they have to, to come off of these carriers through mass action. And that means that the carriers have low affinity. The receptors inside the cells are high affinity. The carriers are low affinity. The carriers are going to be synthesized by the liver. And their total concentration then of the homone is going to be what's free and what's bound to the carrier. These carriers actually can be increased under certain conditions. For instance, in the pregnant female, or in a female who's taking oral contraception, sip, shepsi, contraceptives which are containing estrogen. They actually will make a lot of these carriers, and so the amount of bound hormone can actually increase within the blood. But the free hormone is the one that actually is devel Dictating the activity of the hormone within the, within the body and that the free hormone under those conditions is actually not increased.  
  
**Receptor Types**  
* Okay. So, what about these receptor types?  
* So the receptor types, the first thing we have to think about is, is that every target cell is going to have something like a 1,000 or more receptors for a particular hormone. The second thing is, is it can be sensitive to more than one hormone. For instance, if we look at the pancreas, the pancreas beta cell which is going to be insulin, is sensitive to epinephrine, but it's also sensitive to acetylcholine and it's sensitive to somatostatin. So we actually have multiple targets, multiple receptors on these target cells. And it's the net effect of these, of the activity of these receptors, which actually dictates how the target cell is going to respond. We have several different kinds of target, of receptor types. All of the hormones which are soluble within the plasma, are going to be binding to plasma membrane bound receptors. These are going to be expressed on the cell surfaces of the target cells. And they're come in essentially three flavors. The first is a Tyrosine Kinase linked receptor. And this is example of this would be for the growth hormone. Where this hormone, when we activate it; when we bind growth hormone to this receptor, it then actually recruits second messenger signaling path pathway to it. And that pathway is a Tyrosine Kinase. The second one is actually a receptor that is a Tyrosine Kinase, and this is for insulin. So when insulin binds to this receptor, it activates an inherent Tyrosine Kinase activity, and that, then, causes a cascade event of metabolic actions, which are then going to lead to a change within the, of the metabolism of the cells. And the third is something which is like Glucagon. And Glucagon binds to a receptor, which is called a G-protein coupled receptor. And again this, these are second messenger signaling molecules which are then going to cause the change within the metabolism of the cell. These three receptors. When their, their receptor types are activated, give us a very quick change within the metabolism of the cell. This is different from the receptors which are for our star, steroid hormones or for the thyroid hormones. Those, as I told you, are inside the cell. They're located inside, because these are lipid soluble. And so they're able to go across the plasma membrane. Across that bilayer of lipids. And when they go across they can then bind to these receptors and they, and activate transcription. By activating transcription we're changing the gene expression within these cells and so we are then, it's going to take at least 30 minutes up to maybe an hour to get an effect, to actually change the phenatype of the cell. So these are slower activiating receptors in the sense that their biological activity takes longer to be expressed. Now, the target cell sensitivity actually depends on these receptors. These receptors have affinity for the specific ligand or their hormone. And that simply means that if they have high affinity Then they bind that hormone with very high specificity and very tightly. It takes a long time for them to come off from the receptors. So their half time for coming off is, is long. They will bind hormones that are in very low concentrations, because they're very, very sensitive to that particular hormone. The second is, is that the receptor number is critical for the activity of the target cell. So, the higher the number of, of receptors on the target cell, the more sensitive the target cell is to that particular hormone. The third is competition. With competition is simply that we combine several different molecules perhaps, to this receptor. We combine another ligand or another chemical which can activate that receptor. And in this case, we then are competing for the binding to the receptor. So what am I talking about? So, in the, in the renal tubules, in the kidney. You have a receptor, which is called the mineralocorticoid receptor. This receptor combined both cortisol and aldosterone. Two steroid, derivatized hormones. A specificity is much higher, it, its affinity is much higher for Aldosterone. But it can bind Cortisol. And Cortisol is usually in much higher concentrations within the blood. So this receptor can be activated by Cortisol. And in order to prevent that, the cells actually inactive the cortisol as it's entering into these cells. So that's the, the way that the body then is ensuring that the mineralocorticoid receptor only responding to Aldosterone. And lastly, we can have saturation. And saturation simply means that because we have a finite number of these receptors on the cell surface, eventually we will reach an aceto-. We will saturate all the receptors on the cell surface at high concentrations of hormone. And that, that simply means is that the activity then can't increase and increase and increase. Alright, what are our kinds of stimuli? How do we turn this system on? We actually have three different types of stimuli. The first where we'll have a stimulus which is received by a neuron, which will be within the hypothalamus or your brain and that neuron then secretes a hormone, in this case we're going to secrete ADH. And the stimulus was a rise in the plasma osmolarity. So the rise in the sodium within the plasma. As the rise in sodium occurs, then were going to release this ADH into the blood and its target cell is the kidney. And in the kidney it's going to cause the kidney to, to move water back from the, the presumtive urine back into the body, and we're going to dilute down the sodium. The second type of stimulus that we can have is where we have more of a hormonal hormone control. And this is where, for instance, we could have a change in glucose levels within the plasma. Let's say we have a fall in glucose levels. The fir-, this is received by the hypothalamus. Again, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called GHRH. Or growth hormone releasing hormone. And it works on the pituitary, which is another endocrine organ. And that releases growth hormone. And growth hormone works on the liver, and the liver, then, makes glucose. So the plasma glucose levels rise. And again, we have a negative feedback where we're removing the initiating stimulus. And in the last one, we can have an ion, which is actually, going to activate the system, or some kind of substrate. So, we can have an ion such as calcium, and if the calcium levels then in the blood fall to less than seven milligrams per deciliter, then the parathyroid hormone, thyroid gland, is going to secrete parathyroid hormone. And it works on the bone and it causes the bone to, to release calcium and phosphate. And, so we raise then the blood glu, blood lev, levels of calcium. And again, the negative feedback which removes our initiating stimulus. Alright, so that's how we turn on these systems so how do we turn them off? And as I told you, the receptors are very, very important in this entire, entire scenario so we can in fact have receptor desensitization. And receptor desensitization means, that we can remove them from the cell surface, if we have too much high of a ligand. So that if we have way too much ligand, too many hormones, too much hormone is being presented, the receptors are moved into the interior of the cell. Or we can, we can actually degrade them. So, we're removing then these receptor from the plasma membranes. So, that's receptor desensitization. You can also have a condition where we have an increase in receptor. Let's say that the hormone is missing. The hormone is missing, and so the receptor numbers are going to go up on the target cells. It's as if it's looking for its hormone. And as it's looking for its hormone, it's trying to make itself very sensitive to the hormone that's, that's available. And this is called the rebound effect. So in a rebound effect then, you can actually increase the number of receptors on, On the, on this, on the target cell. The other way of doing this would be negative feedback. So, in negative feedback, and this is more, this is go, obviously, not going to be in more of a local level, but this is a systemic level. And this is going to be removing or initiating stimulus. So, the receptive desensitization is on the cellular level and the negative feedback, which is our most common way of dealing with this, with the signalings, is that, we, is on the systemic level. Okay, so what's our general concepts then? So, the general concepts are that the peptide hormones are going to be soluble in plasma. They bind cell surface receptors. They are fast-acting and they're going to be short lived. The thyroid hormones and the steroid hormones. Are insoluble in plasma. They act via intracellular receptors to change transcription. And so, they're going to be slow acting and they're going to be long lived. The binding pro, proteins, which are our carriers, are actually going to regulate the availability of the hormone to its target cell receptor. And so, it regulates, in a sense, the physiological function. It's going to also regulate the half lives of these hormones and Within the plasma. And lastly the hormone release then is under neural, hormonal, nutrient or ion regulation, and that this signaling then is going to be regulated by changing our plasma hormone concentrations. But then we could also change the sensitivity of the cell receptor to the hormones. So, as you're thinking through this, this lecture then. Then I want you to consider these questions. So, answer the questions on your own. And then you'll have an answer if you click on the bottom of the, of the page. Next time, we'll talk about how we actually are measuring these types of hormones. See you then.

#  1-6 Endocrine System - Assessment and Pathology   
  
So today and we're going to continue with the endocrine system and we want to look at how we actually assess how much hormone we have and whether it's actually functional. And so we're also going to talk about how we classify the different pathologies. So, an assessment of function. If you recall, our hormones are, are going to be ligands, chemicals, and we're very interested in how much of those chemicals are present within the blood. If we have too much, then we're going to have hyper secretion or hormone excess. Under these conditions, we could get desensitization of the cells. We could get actually movement of the receptors into the interior of the cell and down regulation or we can have way too much of a response. The opposite, of course, is if we have too little and this is called hypo-secretion, and here, we have a hormone insufficiency and we don't occupy enough of the receptors to actually get an adequate biological response. And then third way of, of having a problem with this system is that the actual target cell is resistant to the hormone because the receptor, there's something wrong with the receptor. And the receptor could either be missing or the receptor could be that it's uncoupled that is it's not signaling to those second messenger pathways within the interior of the cell, so that the information is not getting into the interior of the cell and we're not getting a proper biological response. If the concentration is just right, then we have what's called normal or eu-secretion and this is the, this is where everything is going to be working correctly. Okay. So how do we actually quantitate this? I told you the last time we were talking that hormones are very, very, very, very low concentrations within the blood, because they are diluted into five liters of, of fluid and the hormones, actually, are going to be found at nanogram, nanomolar to picomolar levels. So these are very, very, very low concentrations. And so, in order to be able to quantitate that, that is to know how mu ch of this chemical we actually have within our sample, we use these competitive binding assays and the binding assays are, are using a specific antibody. The specific antibody recognizes the hormone. So we have the specific antibody which recognizes our hormone and we have labeled hormone that we add to that antibody and mix them. And we had, put enough of the labelled hormone and the specific antibodies so that all of the antibody would be, would be saturated. To this mix, we will add our hormone, our unknown hormone which is in the plasma or in the urine and it's going to compete for the labelled hormone for binding. And we can then we can then count how much of the labelled the labeled hormone we actually have in our sample or after we add the unknown. So this is a competitive binding assay and we use the antibody, because it's extremely sensitive to the structure of the hormone, and secondly, we put on it either a radioimmune tag, so it's an, it's a radioactive tag and that would then be called a radioimmunoassayune or, or a RIA or we add something that has a fluorescent tag on it and then those are called ELISA or these are fluorescent enzyme reactions. These are going to give us very high sensitivity and specificity because of the antibody, so high, and high sensitivity because of our radio label tag or our fluorescent tag. That tells us how much is in our sample, but it doesn't tell us if the hormone is active. Remember when I told you that we can make insulin, but it, but, the individual can make the insulin. This radioimmunoassay would detect the insulin, but if the insulin is not cleaved correctly, the insulin may not bind to its receptor and we don't get biological activity from that particular insulin because it hasn't been cleaved properly, the c-peptide is still attached to the insulin. So this competitive binding assay would say that this individual is making insulin when in fact it's not working. So we need to have a second assay, one that actually tells us that the biology of the system is working and that's what's shown here and these are called bioassays. In the bioassay, we can either stimulate the system or we can suppress the system. So we have two different kinds of assays. stimulation means that we're going to give it to the system and sort of push the system and try to get a big response from it or we're going to suppress it. We have way too much hormone being made and we're going to try to turn off the system. So let's look at an example. So this example is going to be a complex negative feedback loop, which is the hypothalamus regulating the pituitary which is regulating the adrenal gland and that adrenal gland is making cortisol. And we'll talk more about this when we actually do this axis, but for now, we're just going to use this as a, an example. This axis can, is sensitive to low plasma glucose, so when glucose levels fall like in early morning, this axis thing comes on. The hypothalamus will secrete a hormone which is called CRH, it's a releasing hormone, and it works on the pituitary to release ACTH, this is a second hormone and that works on the adrenal cortex to give us cortisol. Under normal conditions, cortisol feeds back in a negative manner to turn off the anterior pituitary and it feeds back to turn off the hypothalamus. So we have a long axis negative feedback loops and we also can have ACTH which feeds back and turns off the hypothalamus. So we can regulate at each level, that is at the hypothalamus, the pituitary, or the adrenal cortex, we can regulate the expression of the hormone at any one of these levels. All right. So what happens then if we have very low circulating cortisol? So let's say our cortisol is low. So if the cortisol is low, then I can give ACTH to the individual. And then, I have to wait for the cortisol to be made, but the cortisol should be made within 60 minutes and I should see a rise in cortisol within the plasma if the adrenal gland is working correctly. As likewise, if we want, we can test the pituitary by giving CRH, so we can stimulate if we have, if the whole system is low, we can stimulate with CRH. So we can turn on this axis by pushing, using the hormone which is preceding the target hormone. Likewise, we can suppress the axis, so if we have, let's say too much cortisol, let's say there is way too much cortisol being made in the body, then we want to give dexamethasone which is a cortisol-like product which is actually should inhibit the amount of ACTH within the body. If I give this dexamethasone to the patient, the ACTH levels should go down and cortisol levels should also fall if the axis is working correctly. If we have something wrong with the, the adrenal cortex and the cortisol is being made because we have a tumor that sits within the adrenal cortex, then I can down-regulate ACTH. My radioimmunoassay will tell me that ACTH levels are low, but I will still have high levels of cortisol, and that means that the regulatory system, the feedback mechanisms are not working, and that the adrenal gland the, is out of control. So, you need to be able to classify these different endocrine path, pathologies, And the way the endocrine pathologies are classified is that if we had a problem with our target, our target hormone, that is with the adrenal cortex, then, let's say we have low cortisol and that's the only thing that's a problem within that negative feedback loop that we just discussed, then, we should see actually, a high ACTH and a high CRH, because the negative feedback loop to the pituitary and to the hypothalamus is, is missing. We have low cortisol, and in the absence of cortisol, that, that axis is going to push CRH and ACTH, it's trying to make cortisol. That's called a primary endocrine pathology We can have a secondary endocrine pathology, and here, again, we have a low cortisol, but under this condition now, we have low ACTH. The problem is actually the level of the pituitary and we're going to have very high CRH, because the negative feedback to the hypothalamus is gone, is missing. So, the hypothalamus is going to make a lot of CRH, but the pituitary, there's something wrong with the pituitary and it's not making ACTH. And because ACTH is absent we have low cortisol, so this is a secondary endrocine pathology. So how would we test a secondary endoncrine pathology? We would give ACTH. If we give ACTH what should we see? We give ACTH and cortisol levels should rise. So that's a way that you can actually test these different areas. And the last one is the tertiary classification and here we have low cortisol again and we're going to have low ACTH and we're going to have low CRH because the problem now is located in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is not giving us CRH, so ACTH has turned off and so has cortisol. So in this case then, what you would do for your patients is you give them ACTH. If you give them ACTH, the cortisol levels should rise. Okay? So this is how you would then go through and classify these different these different endocrine pathologies, and as we start to deal with all of the different endocrine axis, this hypothalamus, pituitary axes, then you're going to be able to see that there are these multiple levels of regulation. And that, at each level, we can have this negative feedback loop, and if the negative feedback loop isn't working correctly, then you'll have inappropriately levels of these of the feeding hormones. Okay. So what's our general concepts then? So, the pathology in endocrinology occurs when there is either too little of hormone or we have too much hormone or we can have resistance of the, of the target cell due to its receptor dysfunction. And we really didn't talk about receptor dysfunction in this particular lecture, but we had addressed it in the previous one. Secondly, we have an interpretation of the hormone levels and this is going to require consideration of either the trophic hormones or the releasing hormones. These are the things which are controlling the downstream target endocrine gland. So, we're going to have to consider their concentrations if the target gland is misbehaving. And then, we can also see that these things can be controlled by ions or can be controlled by nutrients, such as the parathyroid gland or the pancreas, for instance, which actually directly senses glucose. So, if the endocrine problem is at the pituitary, at the pancreas where we are not able to sense glucose and we have very high levels of glucose within the plasma, we will not secrete insulin. There will be an insufficient release of insulin under those conditions. Or, so, why don't you go ahead and consider these questions and think through what the, these basic concepts and apply them to these questions. And again, your answers will be if you just click at the bottom. See you next time.
