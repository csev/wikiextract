# 2-3 Nervous System: Action Potentials  
  
In the last session, we talked about changes in membrane potentials and in particular, about graded potentials, which are one type of mode of non-communication along it is length. Now in this next session, we are going to talk about action potentials, which is a different type of change in the membrane potential that is going to allow for this rapid, communication and signaling along the length of axons. So we are going to talk about action potentials, and for these to happen, you now need these voltage-gated ion channels that Dr. Jakoi referred to.  
  
**Voltage-gated Channels**  
* So these are going to be gated by changes in the voltage across the membrane. And we are going to talk about two different types. One are sodium channels that are gated by voltage, and the other are potassium channels gated by voltage. So both are going to be gated by an increase in the membrane potential (by the membrane becoming depolarized), so becoming less negative. That is going to be the gate for both of these channels. And so, they are going to both open, however, the sodium channel is going to open more quickly. So, it is going to open very rapidly. However, it is also going to do what we call inactivate quickly. Inactive means it no longer allows sodium through the channel.   
* However, it also cannot been opened again when it is inactivated. And so that is why it is shown as a different state in this figure because it is not letting ions through and it cannot be opened. That the potassium channel is going to open. However, it is going to open much more slowly. Both channels are going to close so the sodium channel is going to go from being inactivated to closed, the potassium channel is going to go from being open to closed and this is going to happen in as the membrane is repolarizing. However, the sodium channel is going to close quickly and the potassium channel is going to close more slowly. This time where the sodium channels are inactivated is referred to as the refractory period because they cannot be opened while they are inactivated and we will see what this means in terms of the action potential.  
* So, we have got these two different channels that have two different properties and are moving two different ions. And so what happens during an action potential? So we are going to start out at rest, down here at -70, where both channels are going to be closed. And then, if we have some sort of stimulus. And this is very often going to be a graded potential that is going to cause a depolarization of the membrane of the neuron in this local area. And that depolarization is going to get us above the threshold potential. Which is going to be able to open these channels. So, it is going to be an large enough change in voltage that now these channels are going to be opened. However remember we said the sodium channel is going to be opening very quickly. And so, as in this state that we have right here, we have only the sodium channel open and so if we have really basically only the sodium channel open, we know that then the membrane potential is going to head towards the equilibrium potential for sodium. And that means that the cell is going to depolarize and then even overshoot and have a positive membrane potential.  
* Remember we said that even though the sodium channels open quickly, they also inactivate quickly. So about the same time that the sodium channel is inactivating, then the potassium channel is now finally going to open. And so in this state have the sodium channels inactivating and the potassium channels open. And so in this state five, now we have a membrane that is permeable to potassium. And so now, the membrane potential is going to head towards the equilibrium potential for potassium, which we said is negative. And so now, the membrane is going to rapidly repolarize. And in fact, these potassium channels are going to stay open long enough. That often, the membrane potential can even hyperpolarize (go below the resting membrane potential), and head even closer to the equilibrium potential for potassium, and then once both channels are closed, then that sodium potassium ATPAs is going to work and we are going to get back to the resting membrane potential.  
* So in an action potential, we are going to have these two different ion channels moving opposite ions that are going to be open one at a time, essentially, so that we get this rise in membrane potential and then a repolarization of the cell, and this is going to be our signal that is the action potential.   
  
**Threshold**  
* So now, we have said that we are going to need some sort of stimulus to open the voltage-gated channels, and so if we have these graded potentials we said that they can increase if we have and increasing stimulus. And so as we increase the stimulus these graded potentials increase. However, an action potential is not going to be initiated unless the membrane potential is above threshold. And so that happens with this stimulus, where now we have depolarized the membrane enough that we have stimulated an action potential. Even if we double that stimulus, we double that threshold stimulus so that we make a greater potential that is going to be even greater, even farther by threshold, that does not change the shape of the action potential, it is going to be the same if it is long as the stimulus gets it above the threshold potential. Then, the action potential will look the same.  
* And so that is why we say that an action potential is all or none. It either happens or it does not. And so that the shape of this curve is going to be basically the same and not decay. And we are going to talk about that more, right now. So, the spot where these action potentials are going to occur are going to be along axons. And the reason why they are going to occur along axons is because that is where these volted-gated channels are expressed where they are in the membrane. And so if we say that we have a graded potential here at the beginning of an axon that brings the membrane potential above threshold., then we are going to start to have an action potential at this first portion of the axon.  
* If, when we have an action potential, we are bringing in at the beginning huge amounts of sodium. They are going to come into the axon and diffuse in all directions and since these are all positive charges, then we are going to get depolarization Of the membrane in neighboring areas and this is going to be enough to bring these neighboring areas that are expressing these voltage-gated channels up to threshold and so now this next segment are the axon. It is going to start to have an action potential, which will then start the area downstream from it to have an action potential, and that is how it is going to rapidly travel down the axon. it is through all these sodium ions entering, and then raising the membrane potential above threshold.  
* The important thing to remember is, even though we have sodium ions that are diffusing in all directions, which means some of them are going to go back to the portion of the axon that just and just fired an action potential, this portion of the axon is not going to have another action potential because its sodium channels are in the refractory state. they are in the inactivated state, and so they cannot be opened again until the membrane potential is back down and repolarized, and by that point the action potential has traveled farther down the axon. And so this refractory period the voltage-gated sodium channels are important for once you initiate the action potential at the beginning of the axon, that ensures that the action potential only travels down the axon and not in both directions. As the sodium. ions diffuse in all directions.  
* So this figure is meant to talk about some of these differences in the localization of different ion channels, where for the most part, in the dendrites and the cell bodies of the neuron, we are going to have ligand-gated ion channels. Which means that we are going to, in general, have graded potentials in these parts of the neuron. But then we have talked about how in the axon, we are going to have large numbers of voltage-gated ion channels, and that is going to have action potentials in the axon. So we are going to talk about how this since graded potentials are additive, that the cell body and the dendrite at the neuron are going to be able to have signals that are added and then if they are great enough, after they have been added and summed, then the axon will be stimulated above threshold and will have an action potential travel down the axon to send a signal downstream.  
* In particular, the initial segment of the axon, the portion of the axon that is adjacent to the cell body, the beginning of the axon is going to have a very high concentration of voltage-gated channels. So that it is going to be very sensitive and it is going to be the spot that is going to integrate that information from those gated potentials in order to decide whether or not the stimulation is great enough to cause an action potential to signal downstream. So you can call this the integrative zone of the axon. And so that is what this figure is showing where, remember that neurons can have thousands of dendrites. Which means they have got thousands of contacts with other neurons. And so this is going to show how you can sum all these inputs, and that is because they are using these graded potentials that we said are additive.  
* So, in this example, we have got this neuron and it is showing three synapses. Three contacts between other neurons where the red and green contacts are axons that are synapsing, coming very close to this neuron that we are measuring near the axon. we are measuring its membrane potential. And so, when This excitatatory synapse A. Has an action potential. And then releases a neurotransmitter that is going to bind to some channels in this presynaptic downstream neuron that is going to cause a graded potential in this membrane. We see, we can measure. These little depolarizations from these graded potentials every time neuron a fires. We said that we can sum these so if a fires quickly enough in rapid succession, then we get an additive effect of having a larger depolarization. I n this case, it is still not enough to bring the axon Initial segment above, above threshold so we are still not firing an action potential. However, we also have, remember, a second synapse in synapse b so if a and b. Fire at the same time. Again we will get this additive effect of the graded potentials. And we will get a greater depolarization of the membrane. If A and B both fire quickly enough, then we might be able to raise the membrane potential above threshold and cause an action potential to travel down the axon. As we see in this number, section number four. Where A and B fired rapidly enough and in sync so that we had, we caused an action potential. And then remember also that we have, we can have inhibitory synapses meaning that they are going to cause a hyperpolarization of the membrane. So that means it is going to cause the membrane to become farther away from threshold and that is what we call inhibitory. And so, if we fire an inhibitory neuron, or even an excitatory neuron, then we are not going to be getting very close to threshold. And so, in this way, the cell body and the dendrites culminating at the axon initial segment are summing all the inputs of the neuron to determine whether or not an action potential is going to be fired for signaling downstream. And we will be seeing how this works.   
  
**Speed of Action Potentials**  
* And this is how neurons can integrate information or make decisions about whether or not to signal. So, remember how we were talking about how the axons of neurons can be very long. And that, in certain cases, such as, if we are using neurons to sense fine touch. we are going to need these action potentials to move very quickly down axons. And so there are going to be two factors that are going to determine how quickly action potentials travel down them.  
* One is the diameter of the axon. So you can think of this just like a wire where the wider in diameter, the larger in diameter the wire is, the lower the resistance is and so it is the same with axons. The larger in diameter they are, the faster action potentials are going to travel along their length.  
* Then the other factor that is going to be very important in how quickly action potentials travel down axons is myelination. So remember, we talked about this during our first nervous system session, where we have got these two cell types that are going to myelinate axons, which means they are going to wrap membrane around the axon which is going to insulate it electrically since these action potentials are just going to be electrical signals traveling down the axon.  
* So remember, in the peripheral nervous system that is going to be Schwann cells that are going to wrap around the axon, and then in the central nervous system it is going to be oligodendrocytes that wrap around the axon, and this is going to greatly increase the speed of conduction of action potentials. So, this next slide shows you how this is going to happen.  
* Where, remember we said at the beginning of the axon at the initial segment, we are going to start to have an action potential, and these are going to happen in a myelinated axon at nodes. The Nodes of Ranvier are going to be the spaces between the myelination, places where the axon is going to be bare. And this is where our voltage-gated channels are going to be concentrated. And as remember we said, as the action potential happens we are going to have this huge rush, rushing in of sodium. And that is going to depolarize the membrane around it. However, since we have got this insulation of the myelin, that effect of the sodium coming in during an action potential is going to be felt farther downstream on the axon.  
* So instead of it causing an action potential down here, in the right neighboring part of the axon. it is instead, going to affect the next node, all the way down here, and raise that portion of the node above threshold, so that it can fire an action potention and so during this saltatory conduction that occurs in a myelinated axon, action potentials happen, like a dominoes going down node by node by node, and so this is going to be a much more rapid conduction of the action potential, and a more efficient conduction of the action potential.  
* Remember, while this middle node is firing, even though lots of sodiums are going to be rushing in, in all directions, it won't be causing this first node to fire, because that node is still going to be in the refractory period with the sodium channels being inactivated. So again, conduction is only going to be unidirectional in a axon.  
* Okay, so we have talked about now how axon potentials are going to be this huge depolarization when you have got sodium channels opening and so we are going to be heading towards the equilibrium potential for sodium.  
* Then our slow opening potassium chambers are going to open while the sodium channels are starting to inactivate and that is going to cause a wave of repolarization due to the movement of potassium.  
* And so these electrical signals are going to be all or none. Either you are going to have an action potential or not. It is going to travel down an axon without decreasing in amplitude, like we said occurs with graded potentials, and we are going to have this unidirectional propagation along the axons of neurons.  
* So in the next session we are going to talk about how we have communication between neurons.
