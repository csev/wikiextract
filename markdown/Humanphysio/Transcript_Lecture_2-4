# 2-4 Nervous System: Methods of Communication  
  
So in the last two sessions we have talked about how we have membrane potentials and how they change to form either graded potentials or action potentials and that, those are going to be important for signaling along neurons. But now we are going to talk about communication between neurons and how that occurs. So this is our fourth session on the nervous system and we are going to finish up the next session, with how the system's organized. But first we are going to talk about this communication between neurons, which is going to occur at synapses.  
  
**Synapses**  
* So synapses are going to be when we have two neurons coming usually very close to one another, and we are going to spend our time focusing on the chemical synapse which is going to be really the most common type of synapse between neurons and the one that we are going to focus on. And there are going to be many steps in the transmission of information between two neurons. So one is that we are going to start of with what we call the presynaptic cell. So the cell that is. Having its accent come in. And come very close to either the dendrite, or the cell body, or soma of another neuron. And we know that an action potential is going to travel down that axon, and come to the terminus of the axon. Where it is going to open voltage-gated calcium channels. So calcium's going to enter the ending of the neuron. And the calcium is going to allow vesicles that are filled with neurotransmitter to fuse with this membrane of the presynaptic neuron. And so, when these vesicles fuse with the membrane, then this neurotransmitter is going to be dumped into what is called the synaptic cleft, this little space between the two neurons. So, this is going to be a very large bolus, a high concentration of neurotransmitter that is dumped into this very small space. So it does not have to diffuse far at all, before it hits all of these receptors that are expressed on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell. The neuron that is being signal two. So you can contrast this to the endocrine system, where you are going to have hormone dumped into a space, but in this case it is going to be into the blood. And then that hormone is going to have to travel all the way through Out the body defined its target. So her in the nervous system are having a similar process but we are having a whole bunch of this dumped into a very small space and so its going to diffuse but its going to be very rapid. Once the neurotransmitter binds to postsynaptic receptors then. This is going to cause some sort of change in this downstream neuron. So we have talked about how, in some cases, these receptors that the neurotransmitter could bind could be these ligand-gated ion channels so that they could cause a graded depolarization or a graded hyperpolarization.  
* We can also have the neurotransmitter binding to proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors, that they are then going to start signaling cascades to occur in this down stream neuron or downstream cell as well. So we will be talking about some of these examples later on throughout our sessions. This light is just to have you think about the fact that, since this process has many steps. That then this provides many places where drugs can affect this process. And so this lists those. Where, for instance, in part A, we have leakage of neurotransmitter from the vesicles that is caused by a drug which means then when the signal comes for these vesicles to fuse with the membrane, then not much neurotransmitter is released and so there is not as much signaling between these two neurons. You can also have drugs that increase the transmitter release into the cleft at times when it is not normally supposed to happen, which is often going to affect signaling through this synapse. You can have things that block release of the transmitter, meaning that signaling is not going to occur at the synapse. another important process in synaptic transmission is for transmitter to be taken back up either by the presynaptic cell or by enzymes working to degrade the neurotransmitter in the cleft so that signaling can also stop rapidly.  
* And so, you can have substances that block the re-uptake of the transmitter, which means that the neurotransmitter remains in the synapse longer than it normally would. You can have substances that block the production of neurotransmitter in the first place, and then you can affect the postsynaptic cell by having substances that bind the ligand-gated channel of the receptor that is supposed to bind the neurotransmitter. Or sentences that affect the signaling in that postsynaptic cell. So there are many ways and many drugs that are going to target these sorts of processes that affect neurotransmitter in the nervous system.  
  
**Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials and Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials**  
* Okay, this is to remind you that we can have different types of synapses and so we have talked about this a little bit, but remember how we said if we release neurotransmitter in an excitatory synapse, then that is going to mean that we are going to depolarize the cell. An excitatory synapse is going to get change the postsynaptic neuron membrane potential so that it gets closer to threshold. And so that is often going to happen by opening channels such as sodium channels that are going to cause positive ions to enter that postsynaptic cell. And so we would call this an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential.  
* We could also have inhibitory synapses, where we could release a neurotransmitter that binds to ligand ion channels. That opens, let's say, potassium channels that are going to cause an influx of positive ions from the cell. So that is going to cause a hyperpolarization of the membrane. Or we could open channels that cause an influx of negative ions, which is also going to cause a hyperpolarization of the membrane. And since that is causing the membrane potential to become farther away from threshold, we say that that is an inhibitory synapse, and it is causing an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential in that postsynaptic neuron.   
  
**Neuronal Networks**  
* Another thing that we are going to consider is how we can have networks of neurons to accomplish certain tasks.  
* So we can have convergence, which is when we have several neurons that are synapsing on to one postsynaptic neuron. So we have talked about that how neurons have multiple dendrites and so we can have multiple inputs and this is going to allow that neuron to some those inputs, and then integrate that information to decide to whether or not to fire an action potential and to signal down stream.  
* We can also have a diverging system. Where we have a single neuron that is going to synapse with several other down stream neurons. And this is going to allow this neuron to amplify a signal and it controls several different processes or pathways at the same time.  
* So I want to show you an example of how this diverging and converging systems can accomplish some of the priorities of the nervous system. And so one example is in what is called lateral inhibition.  
* So if you take the point of a pencil and you push it to your finger, you can tell without looking that there something pointed is hitting your finger. However, if you watch, you see that the skin on your finger is depressed not only where the point of the pencil is hitting your finger, but also the surrounding area of the surrounding skin is pressed as well. And so you can see that in this image where even though the pencil point is primarily affecting only this middle axon, this middle neuron, it is also affecting these neighboring neurons as well, a little bit. And so if, just in a normal situation with out lateral inhibition, without this phenomenon then you would get excitation that would look something like this, where this neuron that is being stimulated by the actual point of the pencil would be stimulated most, but the neighboring neurons would be stimulated a fair amount as well. And so you would not necessarily feel that a point was hitting your finger, it might feel something more like the eraser of the pencil hitting your finger.  
* So what lateral inhibition does is make it so that this middle neuron inhibits its neighboring neurons so that what you feel, the area of sensation, is just from this middle neuron. And that makes you realize that it is a point that is hitting your skin and not a larger diameter object. So it increases the contrast of the sensation so that you can tell that it is a, something sharp touching your finger. So this next slide shows you how the circuitry works to accomplish this. And you can see it is fairly complicated, so this is going to be. Right down here, this is showing you the number of action potentials that these beginning neurons are firing due to the depression of the skin from the pencil. So, we see that this middle neuron that we said the, the pencil's primarily impacting, is firing very frequently. However since the skin is also being depressed around the pencil, neurons A and C are also firing somewhat frequently as well, but based on the circuitry where this neuron B is firing rapidly and it is firing on to these inhibitory rapidly which are then synapsing with the neighboring in A and C.  
* And so the fact that it is being signaled so much means that it is inhibiting A and C a lot. Whereas A and C are being activated a little bit, which means that they are inhibiting B only slightly. And so that means we increase our contrast where the final output that the brain is going to interpret as sensation means that B is still firing very, very rapidly and there is a strong signal that it is being touched, but that A and C are now inhibited more. Because B is firing and because of the way the networks are set up so that now we have increased the contrast, now, you are not really feeling the sensation from the skin being depressed and impacting A and C. You are mostly just feeling the sensation of the pencil tip hitting and affecting neuron B.  
* And so this is just an example of how you would get many neurons synapsing on to one single downstream neuron, and how you receive inputs from multiple neurons and you form these networks to accomplish tasks like these. This can also happen between sensory pathways, so if you have something that itches, you tend to scratch it, and that helps because the pain pathway can reduce the sensation of the itch pathway. So, that is the pain pathway inhibiting the itch pathway. Even if that itch that is causing it is still there, it will help it feel better because you are inhibiting that pathway. Or similarly, if you hit your funny bone, or hit something and then sometimes you tend to rub it. So that sensation, that touching sensation, can then help to inhibit the pain pathway, so that you do not feel as much pain even if that insult is still there. And so this are just some examples of how the nervous system can use this, summing of these graded potentials, these networks of neurons to accomplish different Sensations and to accomplish different tasks by the nervous system that are quite complicated.  
  
**Types of Synapses**  
* Okay, we are going to finish up this session talking about a couple of specific types of synapses. And these are important because they are going to be present in the central nervous system, that they are going to be crucial for the peripheral nervous system. And we are going to be talking about the peripheral nervous system a fair amount because this is going to be what is controlling so many of. Our organs. So when we talk about the heart we are going to be talking about the peripheral nervous systems effect on heart rate, for example. And so understanding these synapses is going to help you understand how this control is occurring.  
* So there are two synapse types I want to talk about an the first are cholinergic synapses, named because it is acetylcholine, which is the neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic cell. So this presynaptic release of acetylcholine, will then be released into the synaptic cleft, and then there are two different types of receptors that can be on that postsynaptic membrane that are going to bind the acetylcholine.  
* So two really common ones are going to be nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are going to be ligand-gated ion channels that bind the acetylcholine and that gates them and causes them to open. And these nicotinic receptors, we are going to talk about them because they are on the membrane of skeletal muscle and then they are also going to be found in the brain. But we are going to be talking about them in skeletal muscle in terms of controlling the contraction of muscle.  
* There are also going to be organs and other tissues that are going to be expressing muscarinic receptors which are also going to bind acetylcholine. But instead of being ligand-gated ion channels, they're G-protein coupled receptors, that are then going to cause signaling pathways to be activated, that then cause changes in that downstream target tissue. So these, we are going to be talking about, because they are on the heart, smooth muscle, glands, and as well as the brain.  
* The other type of synapses that is going to be really important is adrenergic synapses. And these are going to release what we call catecholamine neurotransmitters, which are going to be tyrosine based molecules, and they are You might have heard of them before as norepinephrine or epinephrine. So these are going to be released by that presynaptic cell into that cleft and then they are going to bind alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. And these are going to again, receptors that are going to affect second messengers and affect signaling in that downstream cell to cause changes, to regulate that organ or that tissue. So again, these are going to be expressed in the heart and smooth muscle and other glands and we will be talking about alpha and beta adrenergic receptors throughout the course.  
* So in this session, we have talked about how neurons are going to communicate with one another, how they are going to some inputs by look, by summing what is happening in their dendrites and their cell body or soma, that are can occur by spatial summation, by temporal Summation, and then that is going to determine whether or not these neurons fire action potentials. And then we have talked about how we are going to have this signaling that occurs between neurons that is going to be very rapid and happen with these neurotransmitters that are going to bind a variety of different receptors. In the next session, we are going to talk more about the organization of the nervous system. To see how all these processes are how things stimuli are sensed, and then how things can be controlled.
