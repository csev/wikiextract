# 2-8 Senses: Chemical Senses  
  
**Chemoreceptors**  
* In the last session on the senses, in this third session, we are going to talk about the chemical senses and these are going to be these types of stimuli are going to be detected by chemoreceptors. So chemoreceptors are going to be ligand-gated ion channels or G protein-coupled receptors that are going to bind the odorant or the tastant, what you are smelling or tasting, and then cause a graded potential, which then can lead to an action potential.  
* So we are obviously going to be talking about the tongue and the nose, but then also remember that there is also going to be chemoreception in other places, particularly for detecting the osmolarity of the blood. The pH of the blood, the oxygen content of the blood, the CO2 content of the blood, and we will be talking about those systems as well, later in the course.  
  
**Taste**  
* We are going to start off with taste, where on the tongue, you are going to have these structures, a lot of which are large enough for you to see, that are papillae. And these papillae, along their sides, have taste buds. And the taste buds, which are shown down here, have a little taste pore. So, they have got that allows the tastant that what you are going to taste, the chemical that you are going to taste, once it is dissolved in liquid. So that is going to be a requirement because that liquid is going to enter this taste pore and it is just going to bathe the top of these taste cells. That are arranged in a radial fashion, with their tops being bathed by the solution of, that is in your mouth.  
* So, these cells are going to respond primarily, depending on the cell type, to one of five sensations, of tastes. So, we have got, of course, sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami which is kind of a meaty taste that is also found in things like mushrooms, which is actually sensing amino acids such as glutamate. So, it is important that these tastes ligands are going to be dissolved in, in the saliva to get them exposure to the taste cells, and so that they can bind the chemoreceptors. And then once they bind the receptor, so in the case of salty foods or acidic foods it is going to be ions.  
* So for salt it is going to be things like sodium ions that are going to bind ligated ion channels.  
* And for things that taste sour, it is going to be, protons, that, from the acid, that are going to bind to the ligand-gated ion channels and cause a graded potential and then an action potential.  
* And then, for things like sugars and bitter compounds, and the amino acids for the umami sensation. Those are going to primarily bond to protein coupled receptors that are than going to lead to increases in intracellular calcium as well as the iron channels.  
* Both sets of receptors that taste molecules can bind to are going to lead to increases And intracellular calcium, so we know what happens when that happens, that you are going to have fusion of vesicles then with the membrane releasing neurotransmitter, which can then lead to an action potential in the downstream neuron.  
  
**Smell**  
* Smell is also going to be involved detecting chemicals, but the system is going to be built differently. we are in the olfactory epithelium, we are going to have these olfactory receptor cells, and the olfactory receptor cells are also the afferent neurons. They are going to have the cilia and they are going to be expressing one of several types of olfactory receptors. So, olfactory receptor, and we have got at least several hundreds of these receptors that are going to be functional, however we can discriminate around 10,000 odors. And so how does that happen when we only have about 400 different receptors, and so this occurs because each odorant, each molecule that we can detect binds, usually, several different olfactory receptors.  
* And so, the central nervous system knows what the smell is based on the pattern of olfactory receptors that are activated. So it is kind of similar to the different cone types. And being able to detect many different colors, based on which cones are activated how much. And so, in that way, we can detect many different odors. And these, odorant receptors are going to be g protein coupled receptors. And again, if the stimulus is strong enough, then it will eventually lead to an action potential in the olfactory receptor cells, which are the afferent neurons.  
  
**Review**  
* So, just to finish up what we talked about, taste and smell.  
* Where with taste, we are going to have receptor cells that are going to detect one of five different taste sensations, primarily. And that, another thing to keep in mind is that smell is also going to be very important in our ability to taste and to distinguish different tastes and different foods.  
* And then we talked about smell and how we have got olfactory receptors in the nose. And how each odorant is going to bind a combination of olfactory receptors, and that is how we are going to be able to distinguish and identify many thousands of different odorants.
