#  2-7 Senses: Hearing and the Vestibular System  
  
Hello again, we are going to talk about two other special senses in this second session on senses out of three hearing and the vestibular system. So these are going to be associated with the ear and remember that with sound, it means that we have got waves of compressed air, and then expanded air. And so the pressure difference, between the compressed and expanded air is going to be the amplitude of those waves and that is going to determine the loudness of a sound. And then, how frequently the waves happen per second or per time, is going to be the frequency of the sound or the pitch of the sound. So, sound is going to just be these alternating waves of high and low pressure. And that is what is going to be detected by the ear. So, it is going to detect the different frequencies as well as the loudness of the sounds.  
  
**Anatomy**  
* So let's talk about the anatomy of the ear. Where we have got the outer ear, which is going to be shown primarily in purple here. Where it is going to collect the sound and then, the sound is going to cause vibration of the tympanic membrane, which is going to be the last part of the outer ear.  
* So, it is going to cause vibrations of the tympanic membrane, and then that is going to act on the middle ear, which is going to be shown here in green, which has got three very small bones, the stapes, the malleus, and the incus.  
* And so, these vibrations of the tympanic membrane are going to cause these bones to shift, and they are going to cause that same vibration to be transduced and signaled to the inner ear which is going to then act on the fluid of the cochlea. So we have got the vibrations of the tympanic membrane which are then going to cause the rocking and the vibrations to be tranduced through the bones to the cochlea.  
* The important part of this is that these three bones in the middle ear are going to amplify the signal. And the reason why this is necessary is because the tympanic membrane is vibrating because of air. But then in cochlea is fluid, and so in order for that vibration to act on a fluid which is going to be much harder to push on and to move, you need to amplify the signal and so that is why those three bones are so important. So you can see that.  
* And the middle ear is going to act on something called the oval window of the cochlea. And so that means that this sound vibrations are going to get transduced through this top, fluid-filled compartment called the scala vestibuli. So sound is going to travel down this, come around the corner and then come back through the scala tympani, and as it does that it is passing past the basilar membrane and causing the basilar membrane to vibrate.  
* Here's another view of the cochlea. It is going to be a cross section of it. So we have got the scala vestibuli here. So sound is going to first start, and the fluid's going to ripple and vibrate through the scala vestibuli. And then it is going to come back through the scala tympani down here, second. And you can see how right over this is the basilar membrane, sitting right over that. So that is going to detect these ripples of these fluid that were set off by the middle ear at the round, at the oval window.  
* And sitting on this basilar membrane are hair cells, shown down here. And they are going to since they are sitting on the basilar membrane, when it vibrates they will vibrate. And then they have their stereocilias, so these projections that are coming out of the top of the cell. And the stereocilia are embedded into the tectorial membrane. And so, that means that as the base of the cells moves then the, and the stereocilia are embedded in that membrane, then the stereocilia will bend back and forth. And so, when they bend in one direction, it depolarizes the cell, and in another direction, it hyperpolarizes the cell. So in this way, these graded potentials can then signal and often cause action potentials to signal to the central nervous system. So, we have got the hair cell which is going to be the receptor and it is going to activate the afferent neuron by this, the, the rocking and movement of the stereocilia and those axons are going to form the cochlear nerve that is going to signal the hearing.  
* So the next question is, okay, that is wonderful, but then how to differentiate the frequency of the sound and the loudness of the sound. So the frequency is going to be determined by which portion of the basilar membrane is going to vibrate the most. that is going to be determined by the frequency of the sound, and so the part of the basilar membrane that is activated the most is going to let the brain know what the frequency of the sound is, and then the loudness is going to be based on the frequency of action potentials coming from those neurons. So in that way, you can detect both the pitch and the loudness of a sound.  
  
**Vestibular System**  
* We are going to finish up, this session, talking about the vestibular system, which is going to basically give you what you think of as your sense of balance, and we are going to have two different organs that are going to be in the head that are going to allow us to do this.  
* So one is going to be the semicircular canals, which are going to be important for angular changes in the head. So we will talk more specifically about that in a minute.  
* And then we have these organs called otolith organs, which are going to sense Mm hm, vertical or horizontal movements of the head, so that could be through acceleration like when you are in a car and you start going, or when you start stopping or when you are in an elevator going up and down, so those are going to be the sorts of moments detected by the otolith organs. So this is just again the anatomy of this system. So we are going to be in the inner ear because here we have got the cochlea, so it is going to be very adjacent to the cochlea.  
* And you can see we have got three semicircular canals, these big loops that are shown. And we will talk in a minute how they are going to be at 90 degree angles to one another and then the otolith organs are going to be the utricle and the saccule which are going to be in these little bulges near the base of the semi-circular canals.  
* So this figure, again, shows you what I was talking about, where we have got these three different loops that are the semicircular canals, and how they are at 90-degree angles to one another. And this makes perfect sense, so that we can detect movement of the head in the three different planes. So we have got a semicircular canal that is going to primarily respond to nodding yes, moving your head in this direction, versus one that will sense the movement of the head when you shake no. And then another one that is going to sense movement in this direction, you are tipping of your head from side to side.  
* So we talked about how these semicircular canals are these big loops and they are going to be loops that are filled with fluid. And then in the ampula of the loop at the base of the loop are going to be again some hair cells, similar to what we had in the ear, and again with stereocilia, with these projections coming out of the top of the cell.  
* And then they have this big apparatus called the cupula, a gelatinous material stuck to the ends of the stereocilia. And so when you rotate your head then the semicircular canal, since it is attached to the head is going to rotate, which is shown right here. This loop, this canal has rotated but the fluid in the canal is not Stuck to the head. it is going to remain stationary. So as you move your head, the semicircular canal is going to move but the fluid is going to stay stationary and I am going to show you a demonstration of that in a minute. And so the canal moving and the fluid staying stationary is going to tip these ends and make this apparatus move. And so that is going to be what the signal is, that the head has rotated.  
* The fluid staying still in the canal, and the cells, the hair cells moving with the head is what is going to signal that you have rotated your head. This is my demonstration of a semi-circular canal, where if you tilt your head, the canal that is attached to the head is also going to tilt, but the fluid which is in the canal will primarily remain stationary. And so in this way, with the fluid remaining stationary, and the canal tilting, that is what is signals to that apparatus attached to the hair cells and lets you know that your head is tilted.  
* We are going to move to the otolith organs, which are going to be responsible for detecting that linear acceleration of the head. The otolith organs contain otoliths which are these calcium carbonate crystals that are going to be in gel at the tips of the stereocilia in the otolith organs.  
*And we have got two different organs again, able to detect two different movements in two different planes, so the utricle, which is going to be responsible for you Being able to detect acceleration in the horizontal plane, so stopping and starting in the car, things like that.  
* And then the saccule which is going to detect vertical movements: jumping, riding in an elevator, things like that. And that is because it is going to be oriented at 90 degrees compared to the utricle. So, here's an, a demonstration of this. Where when you are standing upright, then you are in the utricle, and you are going to have your cells pointing straight up. As well as the gel and the otoliths. And then, if you then bend down, since the otolith are so heavy because they are these calcium carbonate crystals, then they are going to go down and cause the tips in the stereocilia to be pulled down.  
* And that is going to be then changing to a graded potential, cause a graded potential change into an action potential, and that is what gives you the feeling And allows you to realize that your head and your body is leaning down, because of this pull on the stereocilia from those otoliths sitting in the gel.  
* Here's another demonstration of that, where we have got the otoliths shown here is dark blue, and when your head's upright, they are upright. And then you can see how when you either lean your head backwards or when you have got a forward acceleration you are going to in bot h cases cause those otoliths to bend the stereocilia you have backwards, versus if you lean your head forward or if you decelerate, which also kind of tend to, cause your head to lean forward, then the otoliths are going to move forwards and that will be felt as the opposite, sensation from moving your head backwards. that is going to allow you to know that you are either decelerating or you are moving your head forwards.   
  
**Review**  
* So we have talked about the auditory system, where we are going to breakdown sounds. So even if you are listening to multiple sounds, you will be able to pick out which ones have which pitch and which loudness or volume. And that is going to be, again, transduced into action potentials, which are then going to be fed into the central nervous system.  
* And then we have the vestibular system, which is going to be allowing you to stay upright and maintain your balance, and that you are going to have both the semicircular canals and the otolith organs that are going to be important for establishing that.
