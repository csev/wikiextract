## Implications of Information Assurance and GRC from real CISO's

Ernie Hayden, CISO of Port Seattle and Kirk Bailey, CISO of University of Washington

Landscape of Infosec:
*Technical Security - firewalls, network architecture
*Information Security - Risk Management, Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery 
*Strategic Security - Cybersecurity, Natural Disasters
*Remember: 1 out of 25 people are Sociopaths, Internet is perfect medium for sociopaths
*Trusted relationships are critical


Key Skills of the CISO:  
*READ!  Lots of diverse sources of current and rapidly changing security developments
*Prioritize:  Must respond quickly and communicate efficiently
**Contract Reviews
**Spam Complaints
**Forensic response to breach
**Employee Safety -- <b>#1 due to PR and Liability</b> 
**Credit Card Processing System
**Email Service Interruptions

"The CISO of the future is the one who can run the risk-management organization" - Paul Proctor

Jobs in Information Security 
* Roles
** Practitioners
** Auditors
** Security Project Manager
** Application Security Specialist
** Consultant
** Vendor/Entrepreneur
** Sales/Sales Engineer
** Executive

## Definitions and the roles within GRC

From "Unintended Consequences: Digital Evidence in Our Legal System"

M = f[P*v â€“ (c1 + c2)]
*M is online criminal activity motivation
*P is the probability of not failing to successfully commit an online crime
*v is the value of success to the perpetrator
*c1 is the cost to the perpetrator
*c2 is the consequences to the perpetrator.


GRC = Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance

McCumber Cube:  A Framework for IA professionals to comprehensively evaluate an IT system's security 

*Information States - 
**Storage
**Processing
**Transmission

*Security Services or "the CIA" - 
**Confidentiality - who can see data?
**Integrity - How do we verify changes?
**Availability - Can information be accessed when needed.
**Authentication - verification of ID
**Non-repudiation - you are who you say you are 

*Security Countermeasures/Controls - Mapped to the inner part our conceptual framework of NFR
**Human Factors
**Policies/Practices
**Technology


From Agricultural Age to Industrial Age to Information Age
* World is dominated by the Internet and our interactions through the web.  
* Wealth was defined by Land ownership --> Capital --> Now it is based on knowledge. 
* Time was the sun/seasons --> Factory whistle --> Conceptualized as time zones and communication exchange factors
* Workplace was the farm --> Capital equipment --> Now, it is networks
* Knowledge was generalized --> specialized --> now it is interdisciplinary and fluid
* See slide for more

Our new direction begins with smashing the Industrial Age Infrastructure.  

The Sociopath Next Door by Stout, M. - "1 in 25 people are sociopathic"
Dan Geer - "In the world of networked computers every sociopath is your neighbor"

Threat Spectrum is growing. 
* Local Threats to Organizational/Shared Threats to National Security.  
* Example, Russia's invasion of Georgia.  
* Fundamentally, we must protect critical infrastructure.

Cybercrime is a $105 Billion industry.

Consequences:
* Student fines for illegal downloads
* Outsourcing is becoming a network security
* Amero case - poor digital forensic knowledge in the courts leads to a false conviction of an innocent bystander
* Interdependence of Critical Infrastructure

Security and Privacy - Two sides of the same coin
* Security Revolution - Computers --> Infosec --> Information Assurance
* Castle Approach:: Firewalls = perimeter, Layers of Walls = AV, Intrusion Detection, IPS
* Assumption of breach
* Poor Assumptions:
** Design will implements your goals
** The sum total of control will implement ALL goals
** Implementation is correct
** Systems are are correctly installed AND maintained


Individual Strategy: 
* Awareness
* Layered Defense at home - tools, patches, and upgrades
* Social media privacy options
* Data storage control must be deliberate
* Think like a "bad guy!"
* Limit child's access/Kid Nation - More prone to Blind trust, Cyberbullying, disrespect of privacy

How to grow expertise?
* "OJT" vs Certifications vs Education/Academia
* NSA/DHS NIETP Program
* Cybercorps Education - map of programs




## Laws, Regulations, and Policy-making

<u>Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance</u>

Governance Framework is not a revolution, its an evolution
* Difficult, cumbersome, not fully mature, fragmented with risk information, poorly defined
* Solution: Keep flexible, articulate roles and functions of stakeholders, supports compliance, scalable, and integrated
* Example: Microsoft - has evolved in order to reflect "decision making posture"
* Risk management is about planning and predicting the future
* ISO 31000 - risk assessment process
** Scoping & Planning
** Risk ID: keep an eye on the ball, listen and look, logical risk buckets/ missing key aspects  (E.g. New Orleans in Katrina- good plan, NEVER used)
** Risk Analysis: analyze bottom-up AND top-down, document / Poor consistancy, limited methods/views, Risk assessment too late
** Risk Evaluation:  Optimizing risk and tactics, /scope is inadequate, NO accountability, Lack of Funding, Failure to account human element
** Control & Compliance - Preventative controls - process/human capital /poor design and resource allocation (i.e. firewalls); Detective controls - (i.e. - intrusion detection)

Incident Response

* Old cases - NZ Hacker (DoS attack script kiddie) and Russian Hacker (automated card scheme)
* Network Defense Strategy ==> Network Forensic Readiness (NFR)
* NFRDLC (Development Life Cycle)

Compliance Management: Policy Management

Legal System:  Common Law vs Code Law vs Religious Law
* Rule of Law Indicator - government rankings of countries, decreases risk in business

Policy - form of business communication
* Guiding principle for decisions
* Manages expectations
* Foundation in Infosec

Good Policy -
* Clear
* Describe and explain
* Basis for rules/procedures
* Flexible and reevaluated
* Tips: clear, concise, simple language.  "Must" vs "Should"

Policy Template
* Title and Date
* Rationale/Purpose
* Scope
* Policy Statement
* Roles and Responsibility
* Implementation
* Evaluation and review
* Definitions
* References
* Ratified and dated

Policy Lifecycle - Write --> Communicate --> Monitor --> Modify

Digital Forensics
* Incedent response - response to an intrusion, can be costly
* Old method: 3R's of Accountable Systems = Resistance (e.g Firewalls), Recognition (e..g IDS, integrity checks), Recovery (e..g backup, replication) ==> Defense only
* New Method: Redress - Computer Forensics, Legal remedies, active defense ==> Offense
* Price of all defense, no offense = no points and invites attack
* The State of the Target <==> THe State of Malicious Intruder Capabilities
* A problem of escalation of cyberwarfar i.e. As the target grows capabilities, so does the malicious intruder
* Espionage, Patents/Trade Secrets, Malware, and ID Theft are BIG business:  Well-financed, organized
* Attacks: Vulnerabilities are increasing Network --> OS --> Applications
* Difficult to originate attacks, but (see graph) we do have info on international distribution
* Modern Malware Trends:  Evasive (e..g rootkits), Self-Defense, Multi-channelled, Flexible, High-Quality Software (Rapid improvent)
* Re-imaging > Cleaning: due to persistence of malware

<u>"Elements of Good Policy" by Michael Simon, CTO, Creation Logic  </u>

Introduction to Policy
* Policy: Unambiguous guiding principle(E.g. Do not share employee data) 
* Standard: Specific and required methods/data/processes to direct overall implementation of policy
* Guidelines: NON-mandatory principles of guidance
* Procedures:  Specific process that implements policy (e.g. directions on how to place laptop in car)
<ol>
<li> Should reflect business requirements, should be drive by ???? (couldn't hear)
<li> Enable productivity through access to resources
<li> Clear and concise
<li> Compliance should be measurable - Complexity and Inconvenience reduce compliance
<li> Enforcable
<li> Reflects regulations that drive business model
<li> Regular Review
<li> Accessibility to shareholders
<li> Require/Track/Train the comprehension and retention of policy - very difficult to implement </li>
</ol>
Reviewing Policy
<ol>
<li> Decide on a framework 
<li> ISO 17799, ISO 27001, COBIT, ITIL, ... Know these frameworks
<li> Gap Analysis vs Risk Assessment - 
<ul><li> GA - compares the policy to a specific framework without risk and finds the gaps between the two
<li>RA - compares the policy to perceived risk within a given policy
<li>RA usually influences decision makers more powerfully due to more immediate threat, but potential liabilities can be identified proactively through GA</ul>
</ol>

Capability Maturity Model ([CMM]) - detailed analysis of technology development, identifies 6 levels of Maturity
*Level 0 - Nonexistent - nearly impossible
*Level 1 - Ad hoc
*Level 2 - Defined
*Level 3 - Repeatable/Recorded
*Level 4 - Managed and measurable
*Level 5 - Optimized

How do you get policy?
* Read what they have
* Interviews
* Aim for business drivers
* Reassess interpretation and implementation of policies
* Attend post-mortem events
