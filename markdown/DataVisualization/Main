Welcome to the wiki page for Data Visualization!



## Week 1

Topic: [[Datavisualization:The Computer and the Human|The Computer and the Human]]

After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:

* Understand what data visualization is and the different kinds of data visualization.
* Understand how computer graphics are used to display shapes in 2-D and 3-D, and draw simple 2-D shapes on a web page using Scalable Vector Graphics
* Understand how we perceive, learn, and reason about information.


## Week 2 

Topic: [[Datavisualization:Visualization of Numerical Data|Visualization of Numerical Data]]

After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:

* Select an appropriate chart time, and assign data to appropriate chart elements, to visualize data effectively.
* Understand basic charts and how their elements imply certain characteristics of the data they display.
* Plot more data variables using higher dimensional visualization methods including glyphs, parallel coordinates, and streamgraphs.
* Apply principles of design and color to make a data visualization more compelling, engaging, and effective.


## Week 3

Topic: [[Datavisualization:Visualization of Non-Numerical Data|Visualization of Non-Numerical Data]]

After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:

* Visualize graphs that depict relationships between data items.
* Layout data using coordinates that are not explicitly provided by the data.


## Week 4

Topic: [[Datavisualization:The Visualization Dashboard|The Visualization Dashboard]]

After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:

* Design a visualization system for large datasets and dashboards to support informed decision making.
* Create an initial overview of a large dataset, and then find interesting elements through zooming, filtering, and requesting details when needed.
* Use visualization as a method for forming effective queries that reveal structure in a database.
* Apply techniques from user-interface design to create effective visualization systems.
