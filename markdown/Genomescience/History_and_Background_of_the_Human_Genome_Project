#### Human Genome Project 

[The Human Genome Project][Human_Genome_Project]is really a seminal human endeavor that sets the stage for almost all of human biology from here forward. This section covers how the human genome project came to be, explain some of the key components of the genome project, and give an overview of how it developed over time.

In addition to providing an overview of the genome project, this section also provide a brief overview of chromosome structure to get everybody on the same page. Many of you have different backgrounds so this section also covers groundwork for some of the very basics necessary for understanding how chromosome structure and [chromatin][chromatin] organization affects how the human genome was assembled.

The key molecule for the human genome is the DNA molecule and what you're looking at here is a diagram of human DNA molecule as deciphered by Watson and Crick in 1953. (--Insert DNA Molecule Graphic--)

#### Key Concepts for the Project
Several key concepts arose from the structure of this molecule. Among them is that it defines the physical basis for all of inheritance. This is the material stuff that gets transmitted from one generation to the next.

The second key concept is that the structure of the DNA molecule itself provides an important clue for how it replicates. There are two backbone strands in the DNA molecule that are interconnected by base pairs in a particular way. If you have a single strand with bases it automatically determines the opposite strand. So by denaturing the DNA into two strands and then re-synthesizing the complementary strands, you have a mechanism for DNA replication.

The third important concept here is that the DNA in a cell is finite, and this was particularly important for the human genome project because it was a key motivating factor behind the project.

Since all the information content required to build the cell or organism is encoded in the DNA and since the amount of DNA in any cell is finite, if one could decipher the deoxyneclotide ribosome, the DNA sequence of all the DNA in a given cell or cell type or organism, one would have a database of information that encodes all of the processes that are important to or go on inside the cell. So the idea was that in one really big push you could get all of the information about all of the DNA in a cell and that would potentially be extremely important because then you could just refer back to that information over and over again. And in trying to understand what that information does.
