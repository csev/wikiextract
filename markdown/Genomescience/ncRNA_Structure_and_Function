Today we are going to talk about determining function of noncoding RNAs. For the last several decades there has been a central dogma the DNA encodes for RNA and RNA encodes for proteins and proteins to most, not all, but most of everything.

However, it is clear that RNAs also serve an important functional role. For example, there are the well-studied classes of tRNAs, rRNAs, and Splicesomal RNAs. 

In the last decade there have been several new classes of RNAs identified with broad regulatory roles.

#### Non-Coding (Functional) RNAs

These include microRNAs (miRNAs) which can inhibit translation or transcription or even induced gene activation; large in intergenic non-coding RNAs or lincs which can silence genes or can function as natural antisense transcripts or as scaffolds for proteins; natural siRNAs or small interfering RNA; Piwi-RNAs; or small nucleolar RNAs.

Today we are going to concentrate on two classes, micro-RNAs and large intergenic non-coding RNAs.


#### Discovery of microRNAs

These were first discovered in C. elegans by the Ambros lab about twenty years ago. Lin-4 was known as a regulator of larval development and it was known that the gene product lin-14 via its 3’ untranslated region (UTR). It was mysterious how it was interacting until the Ambros and Ruvkin labs noticed that the Lin-4 sequence was complementary to multiple sites in the lin-4 3’ untranslated region. Subsequent work demonstrated that lin-4 physically bound to the 3’ UTR of lin-14 and down regulated its translation. Lin-4 became the founding member of a class of genes that are now known as microRNAs.
