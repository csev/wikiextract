This is the wiki home page for the Experimental Genome Science course (Fall '12), by Professors John Hogenesch and John Murray.

<span style='font-weight:bold;'>Welcome to Experimental Genome Science</span>
The goal of this course is to provide you with the basics and exposure to many of the different technologies and applications of genomics and proteomics. We will take you through genome sequence, expression profiling, genetics, including clinical genetics, proteomics, and along the way touch on several application areas. Although there are many interesting computational issues associated with these methods and applications, we will primarily focus on experimental issues.

This course is aimed at the entry-level graduate student. Over the years, upper-level undergrads and graduate students from other disciplines have also done well in the course.  At a minimum youâ€™ll need a strong understanding of molecular biology. For students with a computational background, we will introduce how the data are generated, what they are generally used for, and discuss issues of interpretation. It's hard to compute on data when you don't know how it's generated. For the experimentalist, we will give you an overview of many different methodologies and how they are applied at scale. Even if you are expert in one or 2 of these methods, it's doubtful that you are in all of them. None of us are. <br>
