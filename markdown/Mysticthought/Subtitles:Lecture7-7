1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,480
So, the concluding segment of the
concluding lecture.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,310
So what can I say?

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,620
Well, I think first of all to say some
things about

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,258
the kind of decisions that I had to make
during the course.

5
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:17,760
Because of course to put something in a
way which is feasible in terms of a

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,440
large number of people studying in a given

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,200
period of time and yet rich enough was
difficult.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,730
But of course, as Spinoza said, a very
important early

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,800
modern Jewish thinker, the difficult
things are also the precious ones.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,260
So therefore, I cannot apologize for any
difficulty,

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,400
not technical difficulties, but any
intrinsic difficulty of amount

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,230
of material and richness of material,
because for

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,870
something to be precious, it has to be
difficult.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,080
And this is one of the basic ideas in the
mystical path, is

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,920
that one has to go through a certain
amount of discipline in order

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,990
to get somewhere.

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,330
At some point, maybe it becomes very
smooth, it becomes very effortless.

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,950
One needs an enormous amount of effort in
order to become effortless.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,730
So I want to speak about some of the
decisions.

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,600
And really there were two issues here.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,940
Not so much a question of quantitative
selection, but a question of balance.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,140
That there's so many things to talk about,
and I've presented today some

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,300
of the choices that were made in order to
give a balanced presentation.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,750
In order to bridge various demands, give
balance of

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,710
Judaism and Christianity, despite Judaism
being my main field.

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,280
Balance of textual thinking, and
theoretical thinking, and

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,700
experiment, experimental discussion, the
present and the past, etc.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,440
And also there's another issue here, which
is the political question.

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,620
That some materials, that in a course like
this, have to be sensitive politically.

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,350
If we're speaking about

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,700
Rabbi Kook's students and the settlement
movement in the

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,120
West Bank, this is a sensitive political
issue, obviously.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,030
I think that one has to find a way to
transcend the political for a moment.

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,170
Not ignore it.

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,626
But if one goes beyond presentism, and
looks back into the past, one gains a

36
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,462
much greater background in which one can

37
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:03,940
appreciate things that are happening in
the present.

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,541
And for me this gives hope.

39
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,188
That if one looks into the past,

40
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:10,238
one sees many moments of collaboration,
and discussion,

41
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:14,264
and dialogue between people from different
traditions, different mystical

42
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,436
traditions in Renaissance Period, in early
modernity, the

43
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:20,516
influence of Kabbalah on people like BÃ¶hme
and Blake.

44
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,759
The development of Christian Kaballah.

45
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,851
And the, of course, the mass globalized
mysticism of the present and the

46
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:31,496
recent past, with much greater openness to
all the Far Eastern traditions, etc.

47
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,146
Now for me,

48
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:35,366
the essence of the discussion in this
course is dialogue.

49
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:38,426
What is exciting here is the possibility
for people,

50
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:41,146
for many, many people from all over the
world to

51
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:44,954
enter into discussion and dialogue
together, and hopefully this

52
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:48,980
is a spirit which will continue even after
the course.

53
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,520
And what's unique here is really a first
time attempt to really

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,740
present the psychology of European
mysticism

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,030
as a whole, transcending the
Jewish-Christian

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,710
divide to some extent.

57
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,970
And with some thought about comparisons to
other traditions.

58
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,070
And also to, as I said, to

59
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,940
see modern mystical, modern European
mystical psychology

60
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,490
in its own light, and not reduce

61
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,950
it to psychoanalytic terms or other
psychological terms.

62
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,670
Now I want to say some, maybe give some
tips for further research and study.

63
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,430
Because there's an ancient Jewish
expression

64
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,180
that an ancient Jewish sage, two ancient
Jewish sages, actually.

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,520
Somebody came and asked them to teach them
the whole Torah on one leg.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,730
There were two responses.

67
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,450
And one of them is that the essence of the

68
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,510
Torah is, you should love your fellow
person as yourself.

69
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,150
And the rest, go and study.

70
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,740
And from my point of view, he actually did
a trick answer.

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,410
He, he gave a one liner, which is actually
two liners.

72
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,940
That the essence is two things.

73
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,620
Love your neighbor, or fellow person
actually, that's the correct

74
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,490
translation, as yourself, but also go and
study.

75
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,310
So I think this is very much the spirit

76
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,890
of many of the traditions we've been
speaking before.

77
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,470
He said, the rest, literally, the rest, go
and study, [FOREIGN].

78
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,658
That the rest has to be developed by
future study.

79
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:06,770
And we've given the suggested readings,
there are

80
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,978
the discussions, all the things I spoke
about today,

81
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,090
about various directions that I could have
gone into

82
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,530
more but didn't, such as aesthetics and so
on.

83
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,845
And there's a lot of tools here for,

84
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:18,210
for future study, for future reflection
and development.

85
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,710
Now

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,330
one major resource that I want to point at
before concluding.

87
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,980
And there's a wonderful series called the
Global or

88
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,120
World Spirituality Series by the Paulist
Press, the Classics of World Spirituality.

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,386
I think about 150 volumes.

90
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,460
And [LAUGH] while it's very difficult to
buy all of them, of

91
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,500
course, but even some of them give a
wonderful library of mysticism.

92
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,190
A lot of it is pre-modern, but I think

93
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,650
there's at least 50 volumes there about
modern mysticism.

94
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,730
And there's also a series called Modern
Masters in the Christian Tradition.

95
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,220
So with great resources today, the world
of the

96
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,025
Internet, we have all this accessibility
to tremendous resources

97
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,700
for further study, which as I've
emphasized all along,

98
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,848
has to begin with and end with the text.

99
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,370
Now there's a proverb, that they say it's
a Chinese proverb.

100
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,738
I don't know, but it's

101
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:15,280
ascribed to China.
That you can do two things.

102
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,230
You can give a starving person a fish, or
you can teach them how to fish.

103
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,028
Assuming they're near a river or some
place where you can find fish, or a lake.

104
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:28,220
So I ga, hopefully I gave out some fish
here.

105
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,950
But I think more importantly, I think is
to try teach how to fish.

106
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,490
How to navigate this whole world of
mysticism,

107
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,210
of spirituality, and its psychology in the
modern context.

108
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,940
Really, the whole world of modernity,
because there's

109
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,460
many issues here related to European
intellectual history.

110
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,559
How this relates to the influence of
Kabbalah on Spinoza, on Leibnitz.

111
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:52,424
How German mysticism influenced Leibnitz
or Heidegger, and so on and so forth.

112
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:54,780
There's a lot of room here for work in

113
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,103
the direction of philosophy and
intellectual history of Europe.

114
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,518
And let me conclude with the words of a

115
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:04,347
a classic of our times, the Hitchhikers
Guide to

116
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,200
the Galaxy.

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,500
Thank you, goodbye, and thank you for all
the fish.
