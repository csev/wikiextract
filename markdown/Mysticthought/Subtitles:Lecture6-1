1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,720
So, I want to return now to A Protestant
World, because

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,880
we did some work now on Catholic mysticism
in early modern period.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,180
And I want to return to the Protestant
revolution, which we've

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,170
already spoke about for great impact of
16th century Protestant revolution.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,940
On the development of modern mysticism,
and I want to

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,340
speak about a fascinating 17th century
figure, somebody who actually bridges

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,160
the 16th and 17th century.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,350
However, his main works are in the 17th
century and especially

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,960
the text we'll be speaking about today,
Forty Questions on the Soul.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,920
And that's Jacob Bohme.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,560
And again, I, I apologize for any issues
in German pronunciation.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,420
Now, I want to place Bohme as part

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,180
of a wider trajectory leading from the
Protestant Revolution,

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,830
especially Martin Luther, through a
movement called German Pietism.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,270
Which develops very much also in the 17th,
18th centuries and actually it's

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,640
important to remember that this movement

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,540
also, to some extent, immigrated to
America.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,040
Because in areas like Pennsylvania and
generally of places in the East Coast

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,030
we have to [UNKNOWN] the descendants of
German Pietists have talked to them.

20
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,490
And the Pietistic movement is a very

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,570
more intensely spiritual, psychological
development of Protestantism.

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,620
Now BÃ¶hme has besides this immediate
proximist influence

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,950
of German Pietism and with more distant
influence of the Protestant,

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,125
Protestant Revolution.
Bohme also has two other contexts.

25
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:45,230
One is pre-modern German mysticism.
That even though I stress the innovation

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,580
of modernity, there's always of course
also elements of continuity to pre-modern.

27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,710
So we have a pre-modern tradition of
German mysticism that I won't in length.

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,660
It's been researched by various scholars,
such as Bernard McGinn of Chicago.

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,150
And especially Meister Eckhart, and this
tradition which has a flavor of

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,760
antinomiaism of radical thinking, of
radical

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,730
new ways of speaking about God, uncertain

32
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,700
ways.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,390
Eckhart like Bohme was viewed with
suspicion, a certain

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,560
degree of persecution of himself or of his
writings.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,230
It's a familiar story by now, I think.

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,500
And of course, Kabbalah, one has to
remember that by the

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,220
17th century, Kabbalah is very much part
of German intellectual culture.

38
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,160
We've got people like von Rosenroth and

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,210
others before the Reuchlin who translate
Kabbalistic

40
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,780
texts into European languages.

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,210
And then we already have later German
texts

42
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,750
Kabbalah and we have German philosophers
such as

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,200
Leibniz and [UNKNOWN] Hegel if we look a

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,490
bit ahead in time were certainly
influenced by Kabbalah.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,730
Now, Bohme was also and this was something
that has been pointed

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,430
out already by [FOREIGN], that Bohme was
also certainly influenced by Kabbalah.

47
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,890
And it's part of his general
Christianization

48
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,530
of Kabbalah, translation of Kabbalah into
Christian terms.

49
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,570
Now, Bohme of course is not a classical
Christian thinker.

50
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,800
He's a radical thinker, and a very
innovative thinker.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,550
And in some way that I'll argue more as we

52
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,100
go along, part of what one could have
called esoteric Christianity.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,550
Texts which are written explicitly as
texts

54
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,090
which as he describes it, are great
secrets

55
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,650
that need to be sealed, if it have keys.

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,770
So we've got this whole language of
concealment of closing,

57
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,940
or enclosure of deciphering with the need
to be deciphered.

58
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,720
There's a whole sense that there's a
hidden layer under the text.

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,460
And we're trying to get a bit of a flavor
of this layer.

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,120
Now, how does all of this relate to
psychology?

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,400
We'll, we'll get to that in a moment, but
what I

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,030
want to stress is that of course we're
speaking about someone who

63
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,060
has intense mystical experiences.

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,846
He has two strong visionary experiences,
which are the basis for his writing.

65
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:04,150
And as his writing develops, it has it's
own momentum.

66
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,960
But one must remember, this is a
practicing mystic.

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,140
Now his profession was that of shoe maker.
now, which by the way, some

68
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,530
of my ancestors also had that profession.
Now, this thing of the mystic

69
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,300
was a shoe maker is very much related to a

70
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,070
certain emphasis in German pietism which
is also found in Hasidism.

71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,100
That one can be a mystic and find mystical
experience in every day.

72
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,350
In one's work, in one's everyday work, in

73
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,720
one's everyday experience and dealings
with the world.

74
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
And now, risk, something which is to risk
today,

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,200
to this day is the tradition of German
pietism.

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,700
It is

77
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,200
a continuity here, it's something that has
been passed on.

78
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,750
And I'm saying this also based

79
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,280
on conversations with descendants of
German pietists.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,750
So, this is something to bare in mind,
that this is

81
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,870
not something mystic experience which
happens in some other worldly realm.

82
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,520
But actually an experience which is very
much related

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,150
to the everyday, very much rooted in the
everyday.

84
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,560
And this whole German mystical tradition
had

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,150
an influence on philosophers that for all

86
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,010
that they were mildly problematic.

87
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,244
Certainly important philosophers such as
Martin

88
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:18,220
Heidegger in the 20th Century who This

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,420
despite being, I would say, more than

90
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,610
problematic, even reprehensible on a
another level.

91
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,120
Nevertheless brought this German mystical
tradition into

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,330
a greater focus in philosophy on the
everyday.

93
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,530
And it's also part of a history German
philosophy, not just German mysticism.

94
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,260
As I said, part of the German intellectual

95
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,150
tradition which is very strong, is a book
about Liszt, the German Genius.

96
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,660
And Kabbalah, ironically if we think about
Nazis like Heidegger

97
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,390
or Carl Schmidt who also addressed
Kabbalah er, another Nazi thinker.

98
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,920
Kabbalah is part of German intellectual
history not only er, Hegel and

99
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,990
Leibnizford I mentioned but also other
thinkers that we weren't going to now.
