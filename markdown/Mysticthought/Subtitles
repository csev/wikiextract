* '''To view and improve subtitles''' for a specific segment of a certain lecture, click on the suitable link from the list below.

* '''Adding subtitles in additional languages:''' To add subtitles in additional languages to this list click the "Edit" tab on the top right of this page, and after the current list of links create a similar, additional list of links - which will serve as new Wiki pages. Do this by copying the links in the list that appears here and modifying their names a bit. For example, the link to the Wiki page of English subtitles of 1st segment of 1st lecture is
<blockquote>Mysticthought:Subtitles:Lecture1-1</blockquote>
So, when creating a link to a new Wiki page containing Spanish subtitles for that segment, consider naming it
<blockquote>Mysticthought:Subtitles:Lecture1-1'''Spanish'''</blockquote>
After adding the new links saving the changes, click on one of the new links. If you now see a message saying "This page does not exist yet. Feel free to create this page" -- just click on the words "create this page", and insert your subtitles there using exactly the same format which was used in the English subtitle pages.
