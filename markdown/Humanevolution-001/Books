> * <i><b>Victor Bittar:</b> You should also try Survival of the Fattest. Although the name does not seems serious, the books bring some nice ideas about how our later evolution is tied to our ancestorâ€™s food choice.</i>

> * <i><b>Elise Geissler:</b> I really enjoyed "Lucy's Legacy: The Quest for Human Origins" by Dr Donald Johanson and Kate Wong. It's a great mix of anthropological history, descriptions of adventurous field work and information on human evolution. </i>

* <b>[http://www.amazon.com/Lone-Survivors-Came-Humans-Earth/dp/0805088911 Chris Stringer. 2012. Lone Survivor: How We Came To Be The Only Humans on Earth]</b>

> * <i><b>Lyn Aung Thet:</b> I would like to add "Lone Survivor: How We Came To Be The Only Humans on Earth" by Chris Stringer, Head Of Human Origins at the Natural History Museum in London, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and an expert on field and laboratory study of hominins. Fascinating. The clearest yet technically detailed book for non-experts on the subject that I have ever read.</i> 

* <b>[http://www.amazon.com/Masters-Planet-Origins-Macmillan-Science/dp/1137278307 Ian Tattersall. 2013 Masters of the Planet: The Search for Our Human Origins]</b>

* <b>[http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Cooking-Made-Human/dp/0465020410/ Richard Wrangman. 2010. Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]</b>

> * <i><b>Elise Geissler:</b>I am also absolutely in love with Dr. Richard Wrangham's "Catching Fire: How Cooking Made us Human". It usually takes me a while to get through non-fiction books, but I read Dr. Wrangham's book in just a few days. He makes some fascinating points on the relationship of fire, cooking and human evolution. </i>

* <b>[http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/Magic-Reality-Richard-Dawkins/9780593066126 Richard Dawkins. 2012. The Magic of Reality: How we know what's really true] </b>

> * <i><b>Jenny Drayden:</b> I find it really hard to get my head around timescales in history, particularly the sort of periods of time we're talking about on this course. Richard Dawkins' "The Magic of Reality" includes a chapter on human evolution which helped me enormously. It describes a thought experiment whereby you stack photos of your ancestors, one by one, on top of each other (father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and so on, for thousands of generations), and then invites you to take a look at some of these "photographs". Although the book is aimed at (older) children, I was so mezmerised by the simplicity in which it describes something that can otherwise become so complex, that I ended up reading the whole thing and imagining with it. </i>
