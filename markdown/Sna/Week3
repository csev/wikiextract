Concepts: Betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality (+ PageRank), network centralization

Activities: Calculate and interpret node centrality for real-world networks (your Facebook graph, the Enron corporate email network, Twitter networks, etc.)

# Centrality
Centrality refers to individual node.
Centralization characterizes the entire network  by  capturing the inequality of the distribution of centralities.
The simplest measure of centralization is standard deviation of degree distribution.

Freeman's general formula for centralization:

$$C_D = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^g[C_D(n*) - C_D(i)]} {[(N - 1)(N-2)]} $$

where $$C_D(n*)$$ is the maximum centrality in the network.


# Brokerage

# Betweenness
Intuition: how many pairs of individuals would have to go through you in order to reach one another in the minimum shortest path.

$$C_B(I) =\sum_{j<k}\frac{g_{jk}(i)} {g_{jk}}$$

where $$g_{jk}$$ is the number of shortest paths connecting $$j$$ and $$k$$, and $$g_{jk}(i) $$- the number of shortest paths connecting $$j$$ and $$k$$ that go through $$i$$. 

The $$C_B(I) $$ is usually normalized as follows:

$$C_B(I) = C_B(I) / [(N - 1) (N-2) / 2]$$

# Closeness
Closeness is based on the length of the shortest path between a node and all other nodes in the network.
Closeness Centrality is defined as

$$C_C(i) =[\sum_{j=1}^Nd(i,j) ]^{-1} $$

# Eigenvector Centrality
Bonacich eigenvector centrality

$$c_i(\beta) = \sum_j(\alpha + \beta c_j) * A_{ji} $$ 
, where 
* $$\alpha $$ is a normalization constant
* $$\beta $$ determines how important the centrality of your neighbors is
* $$A $$ is the adjacency matrix (can be weighted)
* $$I$$ is the identity matrix (1s down the diagonal, 0s off-diagonal)
* $$1$$ is a matrix of all ones

Small $$\beta $$ signifies high attenuation, only your immediate friends matter.
High $$\beta $$ signifies low attenuation,  global network structure matters. 
0 yields simple degree centrality.
