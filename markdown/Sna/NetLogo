In the SNA course, you will need [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) to explore the models. You can do by loading applets in your browser, or by launching the desktop app.

## Using NetLogo as a standalone app:

* Download (and optionally) read tutorials <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">here</a>.
* Download the <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sna/netlearn/netlearn.zip">bundle of NetLogo apps for this course</a>.
* You can also download individual applet files from the course pages, e.g. http://www.ladamic.com/netlearn/NetLogo502/VisualizationCommunities.html, right click on the .nlogo filename, and select 'Save Link As'. Then within NetLogo, fo to File->Open, and navigate to the spot where you saved the .nlogo file.

* You will also need the NW extension of the applet to run models, starting with Week 2. You can download it <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sna/netlearn/nw.zip">here</a>. If that version is incompatible with your system, try the <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NW-Extension"> latest version from github</a>. Unzip the archive and place it in the 'extensions' folder of your NetLogo application, e.g. on a Mac /Applications/NetLogo 5.0.3/extensions.
