# Auto submit

The provided `submit.pyc` script does not store login and password, but luckily it reads those data from `stdin`. This makes such additional script possible â€” create `credentials` file with your login (1 line) and password (2 line). Save the following script as `autosubmit`:

    #!/bin/sh
    
    if [ ! -e credentials ]
    then
      echo No credentials found.
      exit 1
    fi
    
    for TASK in $@
    do
      ( cat credentials ; echo $TASK ) | python submit.pyc
    done

Now run the `autosubmit` with task numbers given directly in command line, for example:

    autosubmit 1 3

This will run `submit.pyc` for task (**task**, not project) 1 and 3.
