We know that our learners represent a wide range of disciplines and professions, and so, bring a wide range of expertise! The EFI community wiki gives you the opportunity to share that expertise by collaborating with your classmates to author articles about topics in the course and other resources. Please list your articles below.

Remember that a wiki represents the voices of many authors - please respect the contributions of your classmates. To quote from the Coursera guidelines: 

<pre>Please note that all contributions to Coursera may be edited, altered, or removed by other contributors. 
If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly, then do not submit it here.</pre>
