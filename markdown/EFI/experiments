Please post your ideas for experiment designs here. You can make them as detailed (i.e. narrative/description, factors, outcomes, etc. as required for the first peer assessment) or as simple as you like. In developing the course, we have sometimes struggled with providing realistic examples of experiments from a wide range of disciplines or areas of study. So your contributions will help us improve a great deal for the next offering of the course. Thanks to you!

## Experiment Designs
- Testing whether Caffeine has a significant positive effect on how awake a person is

In a group of test persons each one after another gets a cup of orange juice. With a chance of 50% the cup contains also 
200mg of Caffeine (a Caffeine pill which was crashed and mixed into it). They get askes by a survey how awake they feel on a scale from one to ten. They get asked again after 1 hour.

Factors: - Caffeine yes or no

Possible outcomes: - Rise of subjective feeling of being awake in the "placebo" as well as the testgroup. Possibly the test 
group, which really got the Caffeine, will score significantly higher on average.

Things to consider:
- Test persons must be aware that they may drink orange juice with coffein in it and be ok with that (possible allergies!)
- People with bad health (especially heart diseases) should be excluded (questionnairy before the test run).
- The probands should be sitting, not smoking, drinking eating or doing any kind of physical exercise in order to not influence the results. Maybe they could be, for example, watching a movie.
