Please share any great resources around the design of experiments (DOE) that you find. Preferably in the form of annotated links - the link itself, and a short description of what the link points to. Remember not to infringe copyright as you're sharing resources :-)

## Resources

[create sub-headings as appropriate here; also - if you review a resource, please consider writing a short annotation (two sentences or so) about it, so that your classmates can more easily use the wiki resources by knowing what's behind the link!]

### Scientific Python Installation

Installing Python packages for scientific purposes can be a tedious task, The following links provide installers to most of the scientific packages

- Anaconda Installer - https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ [Free]
- Enthought Canopy   -https://www.enthought.com/  [Not Free, but free academic edition , with access to learning resources]
- Python xy          -https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/ [Free, only Windows/]

## Social networks

* [LinkedIn group: "The Design of Experiment (DOE) Group"](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=2235170)
The discussions that show up there are really insightful (You will need a LinkedIn account, and apply to join this group)
