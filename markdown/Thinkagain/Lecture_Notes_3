Lecture 3-1: Validity
---------------------

* Vices in arguments
 1. One or more premises is/are FALSE.
 2. The premises do not provide a good reason for the conclusion.

* Virtues in arguments
 1. Validity
 2. Soundness

* Relation between premises and conclusion
 * In a **deductive** argument, the conclusion should *follow from* the premises.
 * That's a hard notion to do, so we're going to instead focus on the notion of validity.
 * A **deductive** argument is supposed to be valid.
 * An **inductive** argument is not supposed to be valid.

<pre>
[1a] Mary has a child who is pregnant,
[1b] and only daughters can become pregnant,
[1c] so Mary has at least one daughter.
</pre>

* What's validity? Here's a simple example.
 * You know Mary, but you don't know her children.
 * `[1a] [1b]` But, you do know that she has one child who is pregnant.
 * `[1c]` You have all you need to know in order to draw a further conclusion.

<pre>
(1) Mary has a child who is pregnant.
(2) Only daughters can become pregnant.
-------------------------------------
∴ (3) Mary has at least one daughter.
</pre>

* An argument is **valid** if and only if it is not *possible*
 * that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false.

* *Possible* is a problem: how do you tell what's possible and not possible?

* If you **can** tell a coherent story
 * in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false,
 * then the argument is **invalid**.

* If you *cannot* tell a coherent story
 * in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false,
 * then the argument is **valid**.

* Alternatively, an argument is valid if and only if
 1. it is not possible that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false.
 2. whenever its conclusion is false, at least one premise must be false.

* Pick the definition that works for you and go with that definition.

* What validity is not
 * A valid argument is **not** necessarily good.
 * Validity does **not** depend on whether the premises and the conclusions are actually true.
 * Validity depends on what is possible.

<pre>
                  True Conclusion          False Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------------
True Premises   | Some Valid, Some Not   | ALL INVALID
A False Premise | Some Valid, Some Not   | Some Valid, Some Not
</pre>

* Four kinds of arguments. All are possibly, except for one.
* Our assumptions for the following examples of each kind of argument:
 * All Ford cars have four tires.
 * Some Ford cars do not have four doors.
 * Henry's only car is a four-door Ford with four tires.
 * Jane's only car is a two-door Chrysler with four tires.

<pre>
(1) All Fords have four tires.
(2) Henry's car is a Ford.
--------------------------------------------
∴ (3) Henry's car has four tires.
</pre>

* Example #1: True premises, true conclusion, valid argument.
 * P1: True. That's one of our assumptions.
 * P2: True. That's another one of our assumptions.
 * C1: True. This is a valid argument.
 * NOTE! MORBUS EDITED THIS EXAMPLE FOR TIRES, NOT DOORS.
 * EXAMPLE #3 APPEARS TO BE A DUPLICATE OF EXAMPLE #1.
 * TIRES MAKES MORE SENSE HERE. I ASSUME AN ERROR IN LECTURE.

<pre>
(1) All Ford cars have four tires.
(2) Henry's car has four tires.
--------------------------------------------
∴ (3) Henry's car is a Ford.
</pre>

* Example #2: True premises, true conclusion, invalid argument.
 * All the premises are true based on our assumptions.
 * Our assumptions also state that Henry's car is a Ford.
 * But, if Henry switched cars with Jane, the conclusion is now false.
 * It's possible to tell an coherent story with premises true and conclusion false.
 * The argument is invalid.

<pre>
(1) All Ford cars have four doors.
(2) Henry's car is a Ford.
--------------------------------------------
∴ (3) Henry's car has four doors.
</pre>

* Example #3: False premises, true conclusion, valid argument.
 * P1: False. Our assumptions state that some Fords do not have four doors.
 * P2: True, based on our assumptions.
 * C1: True, based on our assumptions.
 * This argument is valid.

* An argument with a false premise can still be valid.

<pre>
(1) Some Ford cars do not have four doors.
(2) Henry's car is a Ford.
--------------------------------------------
∴ (3) Henry's car does not have four doors.
</pre>

* Example #4: True premises, false conclusion, invalid argument.
 * P1 and P2: Both true. Conclusion is false. Invalid argument.
 * It's easy to see how Henry's car could have four doors.

* Every argument with true premises and a false conclusion is invalid.

<pre>
(1) David is either a swimmer or a golfer.
(2) David is a swimmer.
--------------------------------------------
∴ (3) David is not a golfer.
</pre>

* Example #5: True premises, false conclusion, invalid argument.
 * P1 and P2: Both true. But David could *also* be a golfer.
 * Thus, the conclusion is false, making the argument invalid.

* Validity depends on what is possible, not what is actual.


Lecture 3-2: Soundness
---------------------

* If valid arguments can have false premises, then what good are they?

* In a **sound** argument, the conclusion must be true.

* An argument is sound if and only if
 1. all of its premises are true, and
 2. it is valid.

<pre>
Premises  Conclusion     Valid        Not Valid
-----------------------------------------------
True      True           Sound        Not Sound
True      False          Impossible   Not Sound
False     True           Not Sound    Not Sound
False     False          Not Sound    Not Sound
</pre>

* Ways an argument can be unsound
 1. The argument is invalid.
 2. It has a false premise

* If a deductive argument is not sound, then it is not a good argument.

* Soundness guarantees the truth of the conclusion.
