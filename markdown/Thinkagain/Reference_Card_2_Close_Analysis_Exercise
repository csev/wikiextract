### Exercise
"Just over a year ago, President Clinton created the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to protect once and for all some of Utah's extraordinary red rock canyon country. In response to plans of the Dutch company Andalex to mine coal on the Kaiparowits Plateau, President Clinton used his authority under the Antiquities Act to establish the new monument, setting aside for protection what he described as "some of the most remarkable land in the world." I couldn't agree more. For over two decades, many have fought battle after battle to keep mining conglomerates form despoiling the unique treasures of this stunning red rock canyon country. Now, we thought at least some of it was safe.  

Not so. Shocking as it sounds, Clinton's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has approved oil drilling within the monument. BLM has given Conoco Inc., a subsidiary of the corporate giant DuPont, permission to drill for oil and gas in the heart of the new monument. You may wonder, as I do, how can this happen? Wasn't the whole purpose of creating the monument to preserve its colorful cliffs, sweeping arches and other extraordinary resources from large-scale mineral development? Didn't the president say he was saving these lands from mining companies for our children and grandchildren?  

(see exercise 2.9 for paragraph 3)  

Sounds like Washington double-speak to me. I've spent considerable time on these extraordinary lands for years, and I know that an oil rig in their midst would have a major impact. What's more, Conoco wants to drill a well to find oil. Inevitably, more rigs, more roads, new pipelines, toxic wastes and bright lights would follow to get the oil out. The BLM couldn't see this, but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency did. Both of those agencies recognized the devastating effects extensive oil drilling would have on this area and urged the BLM to refuse to allow it, in order to protect the monument.  

Maybe the problem comes from giving management responsibility for this monument to the BLM. This is the BLM's first national monument; almost all the others are managed by the National Park Service. The Park Service's mission is to protect the resources under its care while the bureau has always sought to accommodate economic uses of those under its. Even so, the BLM seemed to be getting off to a good start by enlisting broad public involvement in developing a management plan for the area. Yet the agency's decision to allow oil drilling in the monument completely undercuts this process just as it is beginning.

### Solution
"Just [G] over a year ago, President Clinton created the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to [R, "to" to could be interpreted as "in order to"] protect [E+] once and for all some [G, so we can later say some is not guarded] of Utah's extraordinary [N, because "extraordinary" is neither always good or bad] red rock canyon country. In response to [R, why did Clinton do what he did] plans of the Dutch company Andalex to mine coal on the Kaiparowits Plateau, President Clinton used his authority [?, it's unclear whether it's an authoritative assuring term or an evaluation term] under [R, why was Clinton able to use his authority] the Antiquities Act to [P, wanting to preserve] establish the new monument, setting aside for protection [E+] what he described as "[A, the quotation is an authoritative assurance]some of the most remarkable land in the world." I couldn't agree more [A, reflexive assurance]. For over two decades, many [N, because nobody expects all to have fought] have fought battle [E-] after battle to [R] keep mining conglomerates from despoiling [E-] the unique treasures [E+] of this stunning [N, is neither always good or bad] red rock canyon country. Now, we thought [G] at least some [G] of it was safe.

Not so. Shocking [N, "shocking" is not always bad] as it sounds [G, to avoid someone saying it isn't shocking], Clinton's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has approved oil drilling within the monument. BLM has given Conoco Inc., a subsidiary of the corporate giant DuPont, permission [E, but it's not clear whether it's good or bad] to drill for oil and gas in the heart [N, even though Redford is using a powerful methaphor] of the new monument. You may [G, we may not wonder] wonder, as I do, how can this happen [a rethorical question lets the audience answer by themselves]? Wasn't the whole purpose [C] of creating the monument to [R] preserve [E+] its colorful cliffs, sweeping arches and other extraordinary resources [E+] from large-scale mineral development? Didn't the president say [A] he was saving [E+] these lands from mining companies for [R] our children and grandchildren?  

(...)  

Sounds like [G, just gives an opinion] Washington double-speak [E-] to me. I've spent [A, authoritative] considerable time on these extraordinary lands for years, and I know [A, reflexive] that an oil rig in their midst would have a major impact. What's more [R, because what comes after it is a premise], Conoco wants to drill a well to [R, explains the desire to drill] find oil. Inevitably [A], more rigs, more roads, new pipelines, toxic [E-] wastes and bright lights would follow to [R, explains why they will follow] get the oil out. The BLM couldn't see this, but [D, objection to the BLM opinion] the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency did. Both of those agencies recognized [A, shows it is true] the devastating [E-] effects extensive oil drilling would have on this area and urged the BLM to refuse to allow it, in order to [R, justifies the refusal] protect the monument.

Maybe [G, suggestion] the problem [E-] comes from [R, explains why there's a problem] giving management responsibility for this monument to the BLM. This is the BLM's first national monument; almost [G] all the others are managed by the National Park Service. The Park Service's mission is to protect [E+] the resources [E+] under its care while [D, could be replaced by "but"] the bureau has always sought to accommodate economic uses of those under its. Even so [D], the BLM seemed [G] to be getting off to a good [E+] start by [R] enlisting broad public involvement in developing a management plan for the area. Yet [D] the agency's decision to allow oil drilling in the monument completely [almost A as it's NOT guarding] undercuts [almost E-, but not always bad] this process just as it is beginning.
