# Refutation

Refutation is showing an argument in unsuccessful (invalid, fallacy, etc.). There are several ways to refute an argument:

- Counter-example: an example that runs against a generalization
- Reductio ad Absurdum (reduction to absurdity): refute by showing that if the argument was true it would lead to something absurd
- Straw man (fallacy): trying to misrepresent the argument
- False dichotomy (fallacy): claims that there are only two options (the desired conclusion and something clearly unacceptable)
- Parallel reasoning: refute the argument by producing a parallel argument of the same form which is obviously wrong (invalid)
