# Causal Reasoning

This type of inductive argument tries to explain a given outcome. It is based on generalizations (One event causes another event) that only work in a certain range of circumstances.

## Sufficient / Necessary conditions

    F is a SUFFICIENT condition for G =  
      IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES  
      whenever event F happens, an event G also happens  
      anything that has feature F also has feature G  
      f ⊃ g
      F => G (in math)

    F is a NECESSARY condition for G =  
      IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES  
      whenever event F does not happen, an event G also does not happen  
      anything that does not have feature F does not have feature G either  
      ~f ⊃ ~g  
      F <= G (in math)

## Kinds of conditions

Conceptual: feature F is necessary for feature G  
Causal: event F is sufficient for event G  
Moral: torturing for fun is sufficient for doing wrong

## Sufficient Condition Tests

Negative sufficient condition test: X is NOT a sufficient condition of Y if there is any case where X is present and Y is absent

Positive test: we have good reason to believe X is a sufficient condition of Y if all the following conditions are met:

- We have not found any case where X is present and Y absent (i.e. no negative sufficient condition)
- We have tested a wide variety of cases, including cases where X is present and cases where Y is absent
- If there are any other feature that are never present where Y is absent, then we have tested cases where those other features are absent but X is present (i.e. no competing hypothesis)
- We have tested enough cases of various kinds that likely to include a case where X is present and Y is absent IF there is any such case ("enough cases" depends on a lot of factors and common knowledge)

##Necessary Condition Tests

Negative necessary Condition Tests: X is not a necessary condition of Y if there is any case where X is absent and Y is present.

Positive necessary Condition Tests: we have good reason to believe X is a necessary condition of Y if all the following conditions are met:

- We have not found any case where X is absent and Y is present (i.e. no negative necessary condition)
- We have tested a wide variety of cases, included where X is absent and cases where Y is present
- If there are any other feature that are never absent where Y is present, then we have tested cases where those other feature are present but X is absent
- We have tested enough cases of various kinds that likely to include a case where X is absent and Y is present IF there is any such case

## Complex Conditions

Conjunctive condition: W & X  
Disjunctive condition: W or X

## Correlation vs. Causation

Some tests are not just black & white, and come in degrees.

#### X and Y are positively correlated when:

- the degree of X increases as the degree of Y increases, and
- the degree of X decreases as the degree of Y decreases

#### X and Y are negatively correlated when:

- the degree of X increases as the degree of Y decreases, and
- the degree of X decreases as the degree of Y increases

#### If A and B are correlated, is it because:

- A causes B
- B causes A
- C causes both A and B
- the correlation accidental?

Several tools can be used to help determine what helps what: time (if A causes B, then A has to happen before B), changing A and see if B changes (if it does, then A causes B).

#### Common fallacies

- Confusing an accidental correlation with causation
- Confusing cause with effect (believing A causes B when it's the other way around)
