Lecture 2-1: Argument Markers
-----------------------------

* How can we tell when an argument is being given?
 * Certain sentences are intended as reasons for other sentences.
 * We can tell the person's intentions by which words they choose.
 * Certain words indicate that some sentences are reasons for others. 

<pre>
[1] I am tall, **and** I am good at sports.
[2] I am tall, **so** I am good at sports.
</pre>

* `[1]` The first sentence can be switched around and continue to have the same meaning.
* `[2]` The second sentence cannot be switched around and have the same meaning:

<pre>
[2a] I am tall, **so** I am good at sports. 
[2b] I am good at sports, **so** I am tall.
</pre>

* With **and**, you're simply stating the two facts and that they're both true.
* With **so**, you're indicating that one of them is a reason for the other. 
 * `[2a]` The *reason* why you're good at sports is that you're tall. 
 * `[2b]` The fact that you're good at sports is some kind of *evidence* that you must be tall.
 * `[2b]` is a bad argument, but it *is* an argument.

* **Argument markers** are words that mark or indicate the presence of an argument.

* **Conclusion markers**:
 * *so*, *therefore*, *thus*, *accordingly*
 * The sentence after them is a *conclusion*.
 * The other sentence is a premise.

* **Reason or premise markers**:
 * *because*, *for*, *as*, *for the reason that*, *and the reason why*, *since*
 * The sentence after them is a *reason* or a *premise*.
 * The other sentence is the conclusion.

* Conclusion markers and reason markers indicate that an argument is present, but only in some cases.
 * You can't just look at the word and figure out whether it's an argument marker or not. Think about its **role**.
 * For example, you can't just look for the word **since** and always mark it as an argument marker.
 * Think about what the word **since** is doing in that **context**.

<pre>
[3] I am good at sports **since** I am tall.
[4] The Sun has been up **since** seven o'clock this morning.
[5] It's been raining **since** my vacation began.
</pre>

* `[3]` *since* **is** a reason marker - you're presenting the fact that you're tall as a reason why you're good at sports.
* `[4]` *since* **is not** a reason marker - it doesn't indicate any kind of rational relation, only a temporal one.
* `[5]` You're **not** saying "It has been raining **because** my vacation began." Another temporal relation.

* The same holds true for conclusion markers - they can indicate something entirely different.

<pre>
[6] You don't need to eat **so** much. 
</pre>

* `[6]` *So* doesn't indicate that *much* is a reason for anything.

* Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a particular word is being used as an argument marker or not:

<pre>
[7a] The liberal party has been dropping in the polls **since** the conservative party held their convention.
</pre>

* They *might* be saying something like:

<pre>
[7b] The liberal party has been dropping in the polls **at all times after** the conservative party held their convention.
[7c] The liberal party has been dropping in the polls **because** the conservative party held their convention.
</pre>

* How can you tell whether this person is claiming
 * simply a temporal progression or
 * some kind of reason for the drop in the polls?

* One trick that is very useful is to try to **substitute** a different word.
* If their claim means the same if they had used *because*, then you're claiming there's a **rational relation**.
* If you can't substitute _because_ for _since_, then the word _since_ is not being used as an argument marker. 
* Sometimes that's just not going to be clear. Many people speak very loosely.

* A good test is whether you can substitute another argument marker for the term that's unclear.
* If you can, than that shows that the word, in this context, is being used to show that
 * Something is a premise that gives a reason for something else, which is the conclusion.
 * That there's an argument being given in that passage.

* **if** is sometimes linked with the word **then** in an **if then clause**, also known as a **conditional**.

* **If** might seem like an argument marker because it's often used in arguments.

<pre>
[8a] **If** I am rich enough, **then** I can buy a baseball team.
[8b] I am rich enough. **So**, I can buy a baseball team.
</pre>

* Together, `[8a]` and `[8b]` present an argument.
* `[8a]` by itself, however, is **not** an argument.
 * It's not saying that I am rich enough...
 * ... And it's not saying that I can buy a baseball team.

* The word if by itself does not indicate an argument. It sets a pattern for an argument.

<pre>
[9a] if (ANTECEDENT) then (CONDITION)
[9b] (the one thing) therefore (the other)
</pre>

* `[9a]` **is not** an argument. `[9a]` **and** `[9b]` **is** an argument.

* **if** is not an argument marker even though it is important for some arguments.


Lecture 2-2: Standard Form
--------------------------

* The actual word order doesn't always tell us the order of argument.

<pre>
[1a] Because I am a professor, I teach classes. 
[1b] I teach classes because I am a professor.
[1c] I teach classes, so I am a professor.
</pre>

* `[1a]` and `[1b]` express the same argument: I'm a professor is a *reason* why I teach classes.
* `[1c]` seems to suggest that only professors can teach classes, which is a different argument.

* Let's put the arguments in what's called **Standard Form**:

<pre>
(1) Premise
(2) Premise
--------------------------
∴ (3) Conclusion (from 1-2)
</pre>

* Helps us show what's common to the first two examples (`[1a]` and `[1b]`) that distinguishes them from the third example (`[1c]`):

<pre>
Because I am a professor, I teach classes. 
I teach classes because I am a professor.

(1) I'm a professor. 
----------------------
∴ (2) I teach classes. 
</pre>

<pre>
I teach classes, so I am a professor.

(1) I teach classes.
----------------------
∴ (2) I'm a professor. 
</pre>


Lecture 2-3: A Problem for Arguments.
------------------------------------

* The premises are *intended* to be reasons for the conclusion. 
 * Intentions are nice, but success is better!
 * What we need to figure out is when the person *succeeds* in giving premises that really are reasons for the conclusion. 

<pre>
(1) There is at least one bacterium on Mars.
----------------------------------------------
∴ (2) Τhere is life on Mars.
</pre>

* Do the premises justify you in believing the conclusion? 
 * If the premise is true, the conclusion has got to be true.
 * If you are justified in believing the premise, then you are also justified in believing the conclusion.
 * If there's no reason to believe the premise, then you're not justified in believing that premise.
 * If you're not justified in believing the premise, then how can that premise make you justified in believing the conclusion? 

* An argument cannot justify you in believing that the conclusion is true unless you are justified in believing that the premises are true. 

* In order for the premises to be justified, they have to be backed up by an argument.
 * But the argument has premises of its own that have to be backed up by another argument. And so on:

<pre>
... = (7) Premise
      (6) Premise 
      ------------
      ∴ (5) Conclusion = (5) Premise
                         (4) Premise
                         -------------
                         ∴ (3) Conclusion = (3) Premise
                                            (2) Premise
                                            ------------
                                            ∴ (1) Conclusion
</pre>

* This is known as **The Problem of the Skeptical Regress**.
 * You regress back to one argument after another after enough and this regress might never end.

* There seems to be only three ways to get around the problem of the skeptical regress.
 1. Start with a premise that is unjustified, which doesn't need an argument to back it up.
 2. Use an argument with a circular structure, where claim 1 => claim 2 => ... => claim 1.
 3. Use an infinite chain of arguments - every claim has an argument to back it up.
* With unjustified premises, you could make up, and prove, anything, even things which are obviously false.
* With circular arguments, you could also prove anything. Consider the smallest circle (claim 1 => claim 1) below.
 * If you didn't know whether there was life on Mars to begin with, you wouldn't know whether the premise was true.
 * If you don't know the conclusion, you can't know the premise, since the premise *is* the conclusion.

<pre>
(1) There's life on Mars.
---------------------------
∴ (2) There's life on Mars.
</pre>

* An infinite chain of arguments would allow you to prove there's life on Mars.
 * If the premise has no independent justification, then neither will the infinite chain:

<pre>
.
.
.
There are at least three bacteria on Mars.
------------------------------------------
∴ There are at least two bacteria on Mars.
------------------------------------------
∴ There's a least one bacterium on Mars.
------------------------------------------
∴ There's life on Mars.
</pre>

* If these three possible solutions don't work, then it's hard to see how one would get around *skeptical regress*.
 * It's hard to see how any kind of argument could ever justify us in believing anything.

* There are various tricks for dealing with the skeptical regress problem.

* One trick is to start from assumptions that everybody shares.
 * One such assumption would be that you want a car that is *reliable*.
 * If you want reliability, and I want reliability, that's a reason to buy a car that is reliable.

* But, how do you know that a particular make of car is reliable?
 1. Assure the audience or appeal to an authority ("Consumer Reports has done a study...").
 2. Discount or respond to possible objections ("Maybe Consumer Reports has been wrong sometimes, but this time...").
 3. Guard your claim ("Consumer Reports might be, or are probably, right...")

* Find shared assumptions.
 * Assumptions about the **premises** of your arguments. 
 * Assumptions about **authorities** that supposedly support your premises.
 * Assumptions that you share with your audience in order to get the argument going.

* Finding shared assumptions can be tricky, because it all depends on the context.
 * With an audience that shares a lot of your assumptions, arguments will be relatively easy.
 * With an audience that doesn't share any of your assumptions, arguments will be impossible.
 * Lots of disagreement will cause your premises to be questioned, denied, or rejected by the audience.


Lecture 2-4: Assuring
---------------------

<pre>
I assure you that smoking is bad for your health.
</pre>

* *I assure you* means I'm trying to get you to accept that claim on my authority.
* I might have some *reason* for believing that, but I don't say it.
* I'm trying to get you to accept my premise without actually citing evidence.
* Other examples: *It's obvious*, *Everybody knows*, *Certainly*, *Clearly*.
* If a reason is not actually given, then that reason cannot be questioned.
* If I don't give the reason, I've cut off your attack on the reason that I would give.

* **Authoritative assurances** cite an authority.
 * "The *surgeon general* has shown that smoking is bad for your health."
 * Works only if the audience shares the assumption that the authority is trustworthy.
 * Even the best authorities sometimes do studies that aren't very careful and might even be wrong.

* **Reflexive assurances** talks about yourself.
 * *I believe that*, *I know that*, *I am certain that*, *I feel sure that*.
 * People don't want to question what other people *feel* sure about. It's often impolite.
 * *Thought about it for years* or *under careful consideration* doesn't make it right.

* **Abusive assurances** are a little more subtle.
 * The arguer gets you to accept what he believes by abusing you.
 * If you deny the argument, you're saying you lack common sense. Or are a dummy.
 * *Nobody but a fool would think that*, *Everybody knows*, *You'd have to be stupid*.
 * The **appeal to common sense**: *It's just common sense that...*

* These types of assurances are all used on common speech to stop the skeptical regress problem.

* Why do we need any of these assurances in the first place?
 * We've got limited time. You can't check every study, issue, or authorities.

* Benefits of assurances:
 1. They save you time.
 2. They help you avoid the skeptic regress.

* Tricks with assurances:
 1. Citations of untrustworthy authorities.
 2. Distractions (*That's obvious*, *It's certain*, *I'm sure*)
 3. Dropping assurances (*He says* => *It is reported* => *Sources have said* => *There are* ...)

* We want an assurance when:
 1. Someone might question the claim.
 2. The audience accepts the authority.
 3. It would be too much trouble to cite all of the evidence.

* Assurances are not appropriate when:
 1. No one would question the claim anyway.
 2. The authority is not trustworthy.
 3. You are easily able to give the full explanation.


Lecture 2-5: Guarding
---------------------

* Guarding involves making your premises weaker so that it is harder to object to them.

<pre>
We should not build any new nuclear power plants, because
**(some|I believe that some)** of them **might** explode.
</pre>

* What's an opponent to this argument going to do?
 * Show that you *don't really believe it*?
 * Show that it's not true that they *might* explode?
 * Show that it's not true that *any* of them might explode?

* Guarding a premise makes it more likely to be true, and less subject to objection.

* With guarding, you get people to agree to share your assumption by weakening your premises.

* When you see someone guarding, why did they put in the guard?
 * Have they weakened the premise so much that the conclusion no longer follows?

<pre>
We need a new alcohol officer on our campus because **all** students drink too much.
We need a new alcohol officer on our campus because **most** students drink too much.
We need a new alcohol officer on our campus because **many** students drink too much.
We need a new alcohol officer on our campus because **some** students drink too much.
</pre>

* **Guarding by extent**:
 * Scale: *all* => *most* => *many* => *some*.
 * As you move down this scale, the premise gets harder and harder to deny.
 * Whether this counts as guarding depends on the expectation.
 * It is guarding when you weaken a premise beyond what would otherwise be expected in the context.

<pre>
It is **absolutely certain** that O.J. Simpson killed his wife.
O.J. Simpson **probably** killed his wife.
It is **likely** that O.J. Simpson killed his wife.
**There is a chance** that O.J. Simpson killed his wife.
O.J. Simpson **might** have killed his wife.
</pre>

* **Guarding by probability**:
* Scale: *It's certain* => *It's (probable|likely)* => *There's a chance* => *He might have*.
 * The further you scale down, the easier it is to defend your premise because you're claiming less.
 * The question is going to be whether you've done it too much.
 * *He might have killed his wife, therefore he ought to be convicted.* => Wrong.
 * *He probably killed his wife, therefore he ought to be convicted.* => Might be wrong.

<pre>
I **know** that the President is 50 years old.
I **believe** that the President is 50 years old.
I **tend to believe** that the President is 50 years old.
I am ***inclined to believe** that the President is 50 years old.
</pre>

* **Guarding by mental**:
 * Scale: *know* => *believe* => *tend to believe* => *inclined to believe*.
 * As you move down the scale, you're making the premise weaker which makes it harder to question.


Lecture 2-6: Discounting
------------------------

* Discounting is citing a possible criticism in order to reject it or counter it.

<pre>
The ring is expensive, **but** it is beautiful.
</pre>

* Citing the objection makes it less likely that the other person is going to say it.
 * "I know that! But it's more important to me that the ring is beautiful."

1. It asserts or admits that the ring is expensive.
2. It also asserts that the ring is beautiful.
3. It contrasts the two claims.
4. It emphasizes the second claim about beauty.

<pre>
[1a] The ring is beautiful, **and** it is expensive.
[1b] The ring is expensive, **and** it is beautiful.
[1c] The ring is expensive, **but** it is beautiful.
[1d] The ring is beautiful, **but** it is expensive.
</pre>

* **and** and **but** can mean very different things.
 * `[1a]` and `[1b]` are equivalent.
 * `[1c]` and `[1d]` are very different.
 * `[1c]` is an argument *for* buying the ring.
 * `[1d]` is an argument *against* buying the ring.
* *But* indicates the sentence after it is more important than the sentence before it.
 * You're discounting the first object and citing the reason for the belief you favor.
* The sentences on either side of *and* are reversible without changing meaning.
* The sentences on either side of *but* are not reversible without changing meaning.

* There are other words that are discounting phrases, but fall in a different place.
 * *But* usually occurs before the emphasized clause.
 * *Although* usually occurs before the deemphasized clause.

<pre>
Although the ring is expensive, it is beautiful.
</pre>

* Functions of discounting terms
 1. They assert two claims.
 2. They contrast the two claims.
 3. They emphasize one of the claims.

* Other examples: *even if*, *even though*, *whereas*, *nevertheless*, *nonetheless*, *still*, *however*.
 * These words *can* be used in other ways that are not discounting.
 * Use the *substitution method* to test for what the function of the word is.

* The trick of discounting straw people ("easy to destroy" arguments):
 * The arguer discounts easy objections to make people overlook the more difficult objections.

* Arguers can combine the trick of discounting straw people with misuses of guarding and assuring.

<pre>
The President is in favor of a public health service,
**but** a public health service is not going to solve
**all** of the medical problems of our people, so I think
the President is off on the wrong track.
</pre>

* This discounts the objection that the public health service will solve *all* problems.
 * But whoever thought the public health service would actually solve *all* the problems?
 * The arguer is discounting the straw man by using an unguarded term *all*.
 * The arguer has put the unguarded term in the mouth of the objecter.
 * By not guarding it, he's made the objection more susceptible to refutation.
 * The objector would never have used the unguarded term *all* but *most* or *many*.

* Think about the objections that the arguer is **not** considering.


Lecture 2-7: Evaluation
-----------------------

<pre>
You ought to support my healthcare plan because it would be good for the country.
</pre>

* What is the word *good* doing here?
 * Some will say it's just a way of expressing your emotions.
 * So, the politician is saying "Yay!" for his health care plan.
 * But "Yay, Duke!" is cheering for the team even if they're *not good*.
 * And it doesn't make any sense to say "But, why?" in response to "Yay, Duke!"
 * "Yay for my health care plan" is very different than saying it's a good plan.

<pre>
I don't like fish, so we shouldn't have fish for dinner.
</pre>

* Not liking fish doesn't really require a *reason* behind not liking it.
 * *It's immoral / It's wrong / You ought not to eat fish* is a different story.
 * The speaker now needs to explain what's immoral about eating fish.

* Expressing Preferences ≠ Making An Evaluation.

* One way of to capture this feature of evaluative language is to interpret as:
 * *Good* -> meets the standards; *Bad* -> violates the standards.
 * The standards of a good painting are different than those of a good investment.

* The trick is, when we call something *good*, we don't specify what the standards are.
 * We leave that up to the context to specify what kind of standards.
 * It's like *assuring* - you have some reason, but you don't specify the reason.
 * The claim is more defensible: standards can't be questioned if they're not presented.

<pre>
We ought to turn left here.
</pre>

* We don't have to agree on what the standards are.
 * #1: "turn left here" because it's a quicker way to our destination.
 * #2: "turn left here" because it's a more beautiful and scenic view.

* Less objections if people can apply their own standards to the meaning of *good*.

* Evaluation is another way to avoid the skeptic regress.

* Different levels of evaluation:
 * General: *Good or Bad*, *Ought or Ought Not*, *Should or Should Not*, *Right or Wrong*.
 * Specific: *Beautiful or Ugly*, *Cruel or Kind*, *Brave or Cowardly*, *Comfortable or Uncomfortable*.
 * Defining a more specific evaluative word often requires using general evaluative words.
 * A *bargain* is something with a *good price* and a good price is a *low price*.
 * What makes these words evaluative is their connection to what is good or bad.

* *Contextually evaluative* words are not defined by *good* are *bad*...
 * ...and are only evaluative in certain contexts.
 * A conservative politician might criticize her opponent by saying:

<pre>
His policies are too liberal.
</pre>

* She intends *liberal* as a criticism, but the word itself isn't *bad*.
 * The opponent might say "Yes, it's liberal. I'm proud to be a liberal!"

* We will call language "evaluative" only when it is openly and literally evaluative.
 * It gets defined in words like *good* or *bad*, and not when it's merely contextually evaluative.

* Combining positive and negative evaluative words can be tricky:
 * *Good* means *good*. But *pretty good* is not as good as *good*.
 * And adding a negative, *pretty darn good*, means it's *very good*.

* Another tricky word is "too":
 * *This food is spicy* is *good*.
 * *This food is too spicy* is *bad*.
 * Too is a negative evaluative word because it makes a positive or neutral word become bad.

* **Slanting** is using evaluative terms without having reasons for doing so.
 * People typically slant when they don't have any reason for their evaluation.
 * Good indication that that's where their argument is probably weak.
