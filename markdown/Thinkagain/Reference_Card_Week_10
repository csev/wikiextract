# Fallacies of Relevance

## Ad Hominem argument

An argument that starts with premise about a particular person and draws the conclusion against the point that person is trying to make.

- Denier: tries to discredit a person and offers that as proof that their argument or premise is false/invalid  
"There is reason to believe that statement is false."
- Silencer: targets the person's entitlement to speak
- Dismisser: targets the reasoning, claims we have no reason to believe the point the person is trying to make, and that the point is unreliable
"There is _no_ reason to believe that statement is true."

## Appeals to Authority

Similar to the Ad Hominem argument, except it draws a positive conclusion (the point of that person is true)

- Affirmers: acceptance of what someone said. Based on affirming the person's claim.
- Amplifiers: we should pay special credence to what a given person said. Based on a special right or role in deciding the matter.
- Supporters: the point someone is making is worthy to be true. Based on the person's reliable testimony.

## Other types of fallacies of relevance

- Appeal to popular opinion fallacy: "the whole world does this, so should you" (very close to the fallacy of authority)
- Fallacy in practical reasoning: bases the reasoning on a highly unlikely scenario while the outcome isn't that substantial. In real life, one must look at the various scenarios, their likelihood, the cost, the advantage to be gained (e.g. home insurance)
- Fallacies of vacuity: when an argument doesn't go anywhere
  - When it begs the question: you already have to believe in the conclusion in order to believe one of the premises to be true ("A never fails, therefore A will succeed")
  - When the conclusion doesn't say anything sustaining (e.g. "either it's raining or it's not")
- Circular argument: One or more of the argumentâ€™s premise is the same as its conclusion. (with the premise is distant from the conclusion)
- Self-sealing argument: it's irrefutable by any evidence ("Other people have lived to be 100 years old, and you might too")
