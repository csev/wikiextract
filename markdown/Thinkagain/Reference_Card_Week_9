# Paradox of vagueness

A paradox is an argument that seems valid, whose premises seem true yet whose conclusion seems false.

    Walter is not bald  
    You cannot turn a non-bald person into a bald person by removing 1 hair  
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  
    .: No matter how many hairs Walter loses, he will still not be bald  

The reason of this paradox is because the definition of "bald" is vague. A person with one single hair can indeed be considered bald. If you define precisely what "bald" means, the paradox disappears.

# Fallacies of vagueness

- Conceptual slippery slope argument: same as a paradox of vagueness except that the vague term is a matter of degree (e.g. habitable / inhabitable) rather than a true/false state
- Causal slippery slope argument: the premise that shows the slippery slope ("if you pass a restrictive bill, then another even more restrictive bill will be passed") is not true
- Fairness slippery slope argument: use fairness as the vague term.


# Fallacies of ambiguity

Fallacies of ambiguity (aka of equivocation) rely on two types of ambiguities:

- Semantic ambiguity: when a single word can have several meanings
- Syntactic ambiguity: ambiguity of the grammar in the whole phrase of sentence
