[[Category:Probabilistic Graphical Models]]
Template models are a convenient way of representing Bayesian networks that have a high amount of parameter sharing and structure. There are merely compact versions of a fully unrolled Bayesian model. <br>

One example of a Template Model:<br>

 - Genetic Inheritance
     - Pedigree Tree 
         - Sharing between models
         - Sharing within models (for example, inheritance model that applies to Bart also applies to Lisa and Maggie)
<br>

We'd like to have some way of constructing models that have this large amount of shared structure that allows us to: <br>

 - construct large models from sparse parametrization
 - construct families of models from a single concise representation
<br>

Other examples of template models: <br>

 - NLP (Natural Language Processing) Sequence Models.  for example Named Entity Recognition
 - Image Segmentation (sharing across pixels and pairs of superpixels).  Sharing between and within a model.
 - Robot Localization.  An example of a time series.  Although the position at time t is different/changes over time we expect that the dynamics of the robot are fixed.

Returning to the university example where a student takes a class and gets a grade that depends on the course difficulty and the intelligence of the student.<br>
To think of this problem across a university, multiple difficulty variables (one for each course) and multiple intelligence variables (depending on intelligence of individual students) <br>

###Template Variables
<br>

 - Template variable X(U1,..,Uk) is instantiated (duplicated) multiple times.  For example:
   - Location(t), Sonar(t)
   - Genotype (person), Phenotype (person)
   - Label (pixel)
   - Difficulty (course), Intelligence (student), Grade (course, student)


 - Languages that specify how (ground) variables inherit dependency model from template
 - Different types
    - Dynamic Bayesian networks have been developed for temporal processes
    - Object relational models.  These can be directed (i.e. plate models) or undirected.  For example, people, courses, pixels...
