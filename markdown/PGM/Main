Welcome to the wiki page for PGM-class!

Please join in and help us create the best learning environment possible for your fellow PGM classmates.

If you've previously asked a question on the forum and received a thoughtful and helpful answer, please write out the question and answer in the appropriate page on this wiki; that will save other students a lot of time, and you'll be giving back to the community!

Feel free to create pages as needed. To see how to edit/create a page, see "Help" on the left navbar.

## Lecture Notes

Different students have different learning styles, and having written notes to accompany the video lectures will be very useful to students who prefer learning by reading. Referring to notes is also a fast way of revision, and of course, writing/editing notes will help you to master the material!

This is the link to the video lectures https://class.coursera.org/pgm/lecture/index
