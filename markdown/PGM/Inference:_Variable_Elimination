# Variable elimination

Variable elimination is one of the simplest and most fundamental algorithms for inference in probabilistic graphical models.

   * algebraically, variable elimination is 'pushing in the summations' in the expression obtained from the chain rule for Bayesian networks.
   * rather than working with the conditional probabilities (as prescribed by the chain rule), one can work with **(unnormalized) factors**, e.g. instead of using the conditional probability $$P(J|L,S)$$ one can use the corresponding factor $$\Phi(J,L,S)$$ and properly normalize at the end (after all necessary variables have been eliminated) by making sure the sum over the remaining variables is one.
