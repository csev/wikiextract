Flow of Probabilistic Influence

When can X influence Y?
====
i.e. when does condition on x change "my beliefs about" (probability of) y

* x -> y (causal)
* x <- y (evidential)
* x -> w -> y (causal)
* x <- w <- y (evidential)
Influence is symmetrical
* x <- w -> y (intercausal)
* x -> w <- y (<b>v-structure</b>) nope. eg, "a student took a difficult class" does not tell me anything about students' intelligence

Active Trails
----
A trail $$X_1 - ... - X_k$$ is active if it has no v-structures.



When can X influence Y given evidence about Z?
====
Z is a set of observations

* x -> y
* y -> x

w not in Z
* x -> w -> y
* x <- w <- y
* x <- w -> y
* x -> w <- y nope if w and all of its descendants are not in Z

w in Z
* x -> w -> y nope.
* x <- w <- y nope.
* x <- w -> y nope.
* x -> w <- y yep if w or one of its descendants is in Z.

Active Trails
----
A trail $$X_1 - ... - X_k$$ is active given Z if 
* all its v-structures are activated. ie, for every $$X_i$$ in a v-structure, we have that either $$X_i$$ or its descendants are observed. 
* no other $$X_i$$ is in Z
