A cluster graph is an undirected graph:
* whose nodes (vertices) represent one or more variables (of an underlying [[PGM:Markov Network|Markov Network]])
* whose edges represent a (potentially strict) subset of the variables found in both vertices the edge connects

Each factor of the underlying Markov network is assigned to one cluster.

The **belief** of a cluster is defined as the product of all the factors assigned to it.

**sepsets** are defined as set of variables common between clusters $$C_j$$ and $$C_i$$

A cluster graph must satisfy two properties:


* family preservation: it must be possible to assign each factor of the Markov network to a cluster (i.e. for each factor, there must be a cluster which has all the variables of this factor)
* running intersection property: two equivalent definitions:
** For each pair of clusters and any variable X which occurs in both clusters, there must be an unique path between these clusters for which all intermediate clusters and edges (sepsets) contain X. i.e. there must be a path and there must be only one path.
** For any variable X, the set of clusters and edges (sepsets) containing X must form a tree
