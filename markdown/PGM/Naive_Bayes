Naive Bayes Models
===
Naive Bayes gives us a simplified approach to certain problems by making strong independence assumptions.

Example
---
Naive Bayes Model is commonly used in context of text classification.

Random variables:
*  C: Class  (e.g. type of document)
*  X1, X2,..., Xn: Features (e.g. word appears in that document)

Dependencies graph:
* C->X1
* C->X2
* ...
* C->Xn

**Question**: What independence assumption does the Naive Bayes model make?

**Answer**: Given the class variable, each observed variable is independent of the other observed variables.

$$\Rightarrow (X_i\perp X_j |C)$$ for all $$X_i, X_j $$ 

$$\Rightarrow P(C, X1, X2,..., Xn) = P(C).\prod_i P(X_i|C)$$

Bernoulli Naive Bayes for text classification
---
**Text classification**: We have some kinds of categories and we want to assign our document to one of those.

In Bernoulli naive model, we have a binary random variable for every vocabulary in dictionary. It's 1 if appears in the document and 0 otherwise.

Therefore, the CPD of these binary random variables is: P(vocabulary|document label). For example, P("cat" appears|document label)

It's naive because it makes very strong assumption that event of one word appearing is independent of event of different word appearing given that we know the class of document.

Multinomial Naive Bayes for Text
---

The variables for the features are words in the document, from the first to the last n position. Value of each variable is actual word, has the size of dictionary.

We assume that probability distribution of word is the same over its position.

It's naive because we make strong assumption that word in position 1 independent with word in 2 given the class variable.

Summary
===

*  Simple approach for classification
   -  Computationally efficient
   -  Easy to construct
*  Surprisingly effective in domains with many weakly relevant features
*  Strong independence assumption reduces performance when many features are strongly correlated.
