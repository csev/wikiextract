Question 1 has two forms :

>I-maps. Suppose (A⊥B)∈I(P), and __P__ is an I-map of __G__. Is it necessarily true that (A⊥B)∈I(G)?

and 

>I-maps. Suppose (A⊥B)∈I(P), and __G__ is an I-map of __P__. Is it necessarily true that (A⊥B)∈I(G)?

Be careful!

Also you may want to review the lecture "I-maps and Perfect Maps" to fully understand this one.
