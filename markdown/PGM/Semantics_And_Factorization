Random Variables:
* Grade ($$G$$)
* Difficulty, ($$D$$)
* Intelligence, ($$I$$)
* SAT, ($$S$$)
* Letter, ($$L$$)

With dependencies:
* $$D \rightarrow G$$
* $$I \rightarrow G$$
* $$I \rightarrow S$$
* $$G \rightarrow L$$

Means we have the CPDs (conditional probability distributions):
* $$P(G|I,D)$$
* $$P(S|I)$$
* $$P(L|G)$$
* $$P(D)$$
* $$P(I)$$

Draw a directed graph from these dependencies and annotate the nodes with their CPD. That makes a fully parameterized Bayesian network.

Chain Rule for Bayesian Networks:
$$P(G|I,D)P(S|I)P(L|G)P(D)P(I) = P(D,I,G,S,L)$$


Bayesian Network: 
----
* directed acyclic graph (DAG) G whose nodes represent the random variables $$X_{1},..,X_{n}$$
* for each node $$X_{i}$$, there is a CPD: $$P(X_i | Parents_G(X_i))$$
* represents a joint distribution via the chain rule for Bayesian Networks
$$P(X_1,..,X_n) = \prod_i P(X_i|Parents_G(X_i))$$

Show that BN is a Legal Distribution: 

> $$P \geq 0$$
>
> P is a product of nonnegative CPDs. //
>
> $$\sum P_{X_i,..,X_n} = 1$$:
>
> Use factorization of $$P$$ and reduce by separating out the summation.

We say $$P$$ factorizes over graph $$G$$ if we can encode it with the chain rule.
