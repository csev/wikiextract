Textbook
--------
I have purchased the textbook and found it to be a useful supplement to the course materials.  It would be helpful if for each topic, corresponding chapters or sections in the textbook could be identified.

Answer: If you go on the course page to the [lecture slides](https://class.coursera.org/pgm-2012-002/wiki/view?page=LectureSlides), you'll find which parts of the book correspond with the lectures.

Class Mechanics
---------------
I received no mail to tell me abou the start of the class; I can find no information on this site to tell me when the next class takes place and no way to provide feedback or contact the course organiser other than this page ...Helpppp!!

Programming Assignments
---------------
Please, post well commented vectorized solutions at the end of the course. Thank you!

Calculations
------------
Please provide more examples of the calculations for all the reasoning types: Causal, Evidential, and Inter-causal. Seems like these calculations are extremely important for this class, but the professor assume the ability to calculate these and gives no complete explanation how.
