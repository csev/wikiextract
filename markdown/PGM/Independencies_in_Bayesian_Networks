## Directed Separation (d-separation)
In the following we denote Probability Distribution with P and a Graph with G.

'''Definition 1''': We say that a set of nodes $$\mathbf{X}$$ and a set of nodes $$\mathbf{Y}$$ are d-separated in G given a set of nodes $$\mathbf{Z}$$ if there is no active trail in G between $$\mathbf{X}$$ and $$\mathbf{Y}$$ given $$\mathbf{Z}$$. (Notation: $$d-sep_{G}(\mathbf{X,Y}|\mathbf{Z})$$)

<br />

'''Theorem 1''': If P factorizes over G, and $$d-sep_{G}(\mathbf{X,Y}|\mathbf{Z})$$ then P satisfies $$\mathbf{X} \perp\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{Z}$$.

<br />

'''Definition 2''': If P satisfies $$I(G)$$, we say that G is an I-map (independency map) of P, where $$I(G)$$ denotes the set of independencies that are implicit in the Graph, i.e.: $$I(G) = \\{(\mathbf{X}\perp\mathbf{Y}|\mathbf{Z}): d-sep_{G}(\mathbf{X,Y}|\mathbf{Z})\\}$$

Note that this definition requires that any independence that is implied by G must hold for the distribution. In other words it doesn't require that the graph G represents all the independencies of the distribution. P may satisfy more independencies.
