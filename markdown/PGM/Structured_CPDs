# Structured CPDs

## Overview: Structured CPDs

Tabular representation: works well in a simple case, but if there are many parents of a node (say, k), then the number of entries are O($$2^k$$), so not really suitable.

### Context-specific independence

Independence only occurs when Z = c:

$$P(X,Y \mid Z, c) = P(X \mid Z,c) P(Y \mid Z,c)$$

$$P(X \mid Y, Z, c) = P(X \mid Z, c)$$

$$P(Y \mid X, Z, c) = P(Y \mid Z, c)$$

One example: Deterministic OR, where these are independent

$$(X \perp Y_1 \mid y^1_2)$$, i.e. $$(X \perp Y_1 \mid y_2, 1)$$

$$(Y_1 \perp Y_2 \mid x^0)$$

Neither of these would hold for a general-purpose CPD.

Conventions followed:

$$X_i^0 = 0, X_i^1 = 1$$
