MATLAB is all about matrices
-----------------------------
A key feature of MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is that it is based on matrix manipulations. In order to gain the full benefit of its power, you should learn to center your code around matrix manipulations. This can reduce the amount of coding required, alleviate the need for longer loops, make your code more elegant, reduce your run time, and if the skill is mastered, it can eventually help you code faster.

To learn to make use of the neat little matrix tricks, you should work at gaining this skill. One way to do so is to rewrite your code and replace whatever you can with matrix multiplications, transposes, concatenations or separations. This skill can take time to build, but it will be rewarding in future MATLAB projects.

**Example: Vector normalization**

Let `A = [1 2 3 4 5]` be our evidence. We would like to normalize these values to obtain probabilities. Instead of using a  `for` loop, we can simply write: 

`A ./ sum(A)`.


Matrix operations vs. element-wise operations
-----------------------------
There are two kinds of operations: matrix-wise and element-wise. Be careful to choose the right one. Element-wise operations are prefixed by a dot: `.+`, `.*` etc.

**Example: Square of a matrix**

Let `A` be a matrix, for example `A = magic(3)` or `A = rand(3)`.
* `B = A^2` is a matrix operation $$A \times A$$. It calculates $$b_{ij} = \sum_{r=1}^n a_{ir}a_{rj}$$.
* `B = A.^2` is an element-wise operation. It returns a matrix where each element is the square of the original one: $$b_{ij} = a_{ij}^2$$.

Creating an automated test
-------------------------

Two functions in the same file
-------------------------
     A = MainFunction(parameters)
     
     
     return 
     
     B = Auxiliary1Function(Params1)
     
      
     return  

     C = Auxiliary2Function(Params2)
    
    
     return 

Note:

1. The order is important: The main function must be first.
2. The auxiliary functions are visible only to other functions in the same file.
3. There is no `end` at the end of the functions.

Returning 2 or more values in a function
-----------------------

Many functions in MATLAB/Octave return 2 or more results. To get them when you call such a function you must make an assignment of the form:

[A, B] = foo(bar)

You must keep in mind that MATLAB/Octave will never warn you that you are missing any results. For example, if foo returns 2 values and you make an assignment of the form:

A= foo(bar)

the interpreter will not complain and will assign the first result to A and drop the second.

The "find" function
---------------

  MATLAB and Octave include the find function for searching in a matrix or a list.  Find returns a list of indexes where its argument evaluates to 1. For example, if A is a vector of 0's and 1's, 

i=find(A) 

i will contain the indexes of A where A is 1.

  As we said find returns the indexes where its argument evaluates to 1. Thus giving find any valid expression that returns a matrix or a vector will return the indexes where the evaluation is equal to 1. For example, let B a vector of real numbers and c a real number, then the instruction 

i=find(B>c)

 will return in i the indexes where B >c.

When called using the form:

[i,j] = find(A)

i will contain the rows and j will contain the columns where A evaluates to 1.

Finally if A is a matrix and you call find using the form:

i = find(A)

find will return the ordinal positions where A evaluates to 1 as if the rows in A were concatenated each after other. For example if A=(0 0 0; 0 0 1; 0 0 0) then

i= find(A) 

will return 6.
