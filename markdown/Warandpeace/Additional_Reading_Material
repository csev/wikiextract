From simply viewing the course syllabus for the overall course, I suspect that a great deal of the course will examine US foreign policy and military actions.

There is a wealth of related reading available from the US Army's Center of Military History. The material is largely or entirely in the public domain within the US, although I'm not sure if international access is possible.

The link to their online resouce center is:

I have published a couple of pieces on deterrence that may be of some interest to course participants.

1) "Rational Choice Deterrence and Israeli Counter-Terrorism", 2006, refereed. http://www.asymmetricconflict.org/articles/rational-choice-deterrence-and-israeli-counter-terrorism/

2) "Demolitions and Deterrence: Cheap Politics Meets Institutionalized Rage", 2005. A short blog post about the effectiveness of Israel's former home-demolition policy as a deterrent against suicide bombings. http://radlauer.blogspot.co.il/2005/12/demolitions-and-deterrence_113397840677692005.html

3) "Can Israel accept a nuclear Iran? The deterrence argument", undated (but still quite relevant). Another short blog post, this time dealing with the possibility (or impossibility) of Israeli-Iranian mutual nuclear deterrence. http://www.asymmetricconflict.org/blog/can-israel-accept-a-nuclear-iran/

4) "Syria and the Syntax of Deterrence", September 2013. Analyzing the recent U.S. "climb-down" as an example of <i>successful</i> deterrent policy. http://www.asymmetricconflict.org/blog/syria-and-the-syntax-of-deterrence/

Enjoy!
