Here are some calculus techniques that will be useful in the course.

**1. Differentiate and integrate polynomials**  

Assume you already know this.
  
  
**2. Compute definite integrals**  
  
Let $$F$$ be the anti-derivative of $$f$$, ie  
  
$$ F'(x) = f(x) $$  
  
then  
  
$$ \displaystyle\int_a^b { f(t) dt } = F(b) - F(a) $$  
  
This is known as the fundamental theorem of calculus.  
  
  
**3. The Exponential function**  
  
The exponential function is $$e^x$$. It is also written as exp(x) in the lecture.  
  
The derivatives of exponential function is the function itself.  
  
$$ \dfrac d {dx} {e^x} = e^x $$  
  
So the indefinite integral is  
  
$$ \displaystyle\int {e^x} dx = {e^x} + C $$  
  
(Note the result of indefinite integral has a constant C).  
  
The exponential function is defined by the power series  
  
$$ e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{4^3}{4!}+ ... = \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac {x^n} {n!} $$  
  
Seriously! Check this out in wikipedia.  
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function#Formal_definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function#Formal_definition)  
  
We can use this to find the approximate numerical result of an exponential function. For example, find $$ e^{0.5} $$ by adding the first 4 terms:  
  
$$ e^{0.5} = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 / 2! + 0.125 / 3! + ... \cong 1.6458 $$  
  
This approximates $$ \sqrt e $$ within 0.2%.  
  
The Poisson distribution is closely related to the power series, those PMF is $$ \frac {\lambda^k} {k!} \cdot e^{-\lambda} $$ where k is 0, 1, 2, 3, ...  
  
  
**4. Chain Rule (of differentiation)**  
  
In some case we are given probability in the form such as $$ e^{-x / 5} $$, for example, in lecture 2 slide 17 the "PDF example". This can be arrange as a composite function $$f \circ g = f(g(x))$$, where $$ f(u) = e^u $$ and $$ g(x) = - x / 5$$. To differentiate, we need to apply the chain rule, that is  
  
$$ (f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(t)) \cdot g'(t) $$  
  
In the above case, find the derivate of $$ e^{-x / 5} $$ using  
  
$$ f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = e^{-x / 5} (- \frac 1 5 ) $$  
  
  
**5. Substitution rule**  
  
In integration, the counterpart to the chain rule is the substitution rule. It is also known as u-substitution. This is just the reverse of the chain rule.  
  
$$ \displaystyle\int f'(u) du = \displaystyle\int f'(g(t)) g'(t) dt $$  
  
To solve the integral on the example slide of the PDF section, let $$ u=-\frac x 5 $$. Then $$ du = -\frac 1 5 dx $$.  
  
$$ \displaystyle\int e^{-x / 5} ( \frac 1 5 ) dx = - \displaystyle\int e^u du = -e^{-x / 5} + C $$  
  
Actually we already know the answer because this is the reverse of what we have done in the chain rule section.  
  
To use the substitution rule, the strategy is to look for an inner function u. Then find out the derivative $$ du $$. Hopefully it will match the other part of the function that we are integrating.  
  
* * *  
  
With these technique we can now solve the complex looking density function that appeared in the quiz. How do we integrate $$ e^{-x} (1 + e^{-x}) ^ {-2} $$? We can apply the substitution rule. The question is what should we choose as $$ u $$? A lot of times, this comes down to making an educated guess. Given a function $$ f $$, what might its antiderivative $$ F $$ looks like? Make a guess and try to differentiate it to see if the results is indeed $$f$$. Here is a hint, do you see a $$ \frac 1 {u^2} $$ in the above function? What will be the corresponding $$ du $$?  
  
These are some reminder on the calculus. If you have not worked on calculus problem for a long time you may still find this difficult. Practice will help.
