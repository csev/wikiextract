## Useful online resources

Here are some online resources to help us all get up to speed on statistics in general - some of us haven't used what we learned in years!

[Methods in Biostatistics I](http://ocw.jhsph.edu/index.cfm/go/viewCourse/course/MethodsInBiostatisticsI/coursePage/index/) - professor Caffo course from Johns Hopkins, there you will find a lot of useful information like suggested readings and so on.

[Rice Virtual Lab in Statistics](http://onlinestatbook.com/rvls/) - interactive and hyper-text (online only)

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) - a large (~22 MB) PDF download of a book from the Springer Series in Statistics

[Introduction to Statistical Thought](https://www.math.umass.edu/~lavine/Book/book.pdf) by Michael Lavine - a larger (~42 MB) download of a text focused more on the theoretic/mathematical underpinnings of statistics.

[StatSoft Statistics: Methods & Applications](http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/) - totally online, though a physical book is available from StatSoft directly for $80 plus shipping.

[R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) is a site that aggregates blogs from all over that are focused on the use of the R language, but there are plenty of interesting examples that are understandable even if you don't know R.

[Khan Academy](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL17567A1A3F5DB5E4) YouTube videos on math and statistics

[Freemath](http://freemath.wikia.com/wiki/Free_Math_Sources#Probability_.26_Statistics) - contains currently 10 free books on the probability & statistics including some of the above

## Notations and Definitions

**log** - if not stated opposite assume that log represents natural logarithm
