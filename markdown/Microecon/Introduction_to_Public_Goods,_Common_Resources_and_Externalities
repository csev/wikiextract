#Notes for Week 8: 1.1 Introduction to Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities

##Definition of 'public goods'  
* 1.) A commodity or service that is provided without profit to all members of a society, either by the government or a private individual or organization
* 2.) The benefit or well-being of the public.
 	
##Definition of 'Common Resource'
* 1.)A resource, such as water or pasture, that provides users with tangible benefits. A major concern with common resources is overuse, especially when there are poor social-management systems in place to protect the core resource.
* 2.)Common resources that are not owned by anyone are called open-access resources. 

##Lecture Explanation of Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities:
Goods that do not have a price or are free of charge give a challenge for their allocation in free markets, therefore everyone has access to those goods, but the more people use those goods, the more difficult it is to manage the resource. Because the markets cannot ensure that the good is produced or consumed in the proper amount, sometimes when dealing with those types of resources the markets actually have a lot of trouble distributing those resources on their own.

##When Free Markets Fail
Free markets, in fact do not do a good job allocating theses resources and that is a
perfect justification for the government to intervene in the markets and try to improve distribution scheme the markets provide.

##Some examples of these free markets:
The library commons
Fish
clean air
clean water

##Key Question:
* The question we aim to answer at the end of the lecture series for week 8 is:

* How does the library manage the commons area for maximum productivity?
