##Notes for Week 8: 4.1 The Tragedy of the Commons

Fish problem:
Suppose that fish cost a $1/lb and marginal cost of running a fishing vessel is $200 per day.
Say currently there are 7 boats fishing, would you send the eighth boat out to fish?

#Vessels Total catch (lb)
1	 400
2	 800
3	 1200
4	 1600
5	 1900
6	 2100
7	 2100
8	 2000

A)  you own ONLY the eighth boat,
If you go, revenue=2000/8=250*$1=$250. 

B) you own ALL the eight boats,

# Vessels	Total catch (lb)	Marginal revenue	Avg. Revenue	Total Profits
1	400	$400	$400	$200
2	800	$400	$400	$400
3	1200	$400	$400	$600
4	1600	$400	$400	$800
5	1900	$300	$380	$900
6	2100	$200	$350	$900
7	2100	$0	$300	$700
8	2000	($100)	$250	$400

So, you'll send only 6 boats out. This paradox is called The Tragedy of the Commons.
