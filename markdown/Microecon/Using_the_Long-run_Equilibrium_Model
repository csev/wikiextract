#Notes for Week 6: 4.3 Using the Long-run Equilibrium Model

##The BBQ Model of Long-run Equilibrium
* We were brought back into the model of the BBQ shop and comparing the firm and market using the long-run equilibrium model and what happens when the demand increases.

* From a company setup for long-term equilibrium where MC=ATC=P, with an increase in demand, in the short-term profits increase.

* When demand goes up, supply goes up to meet, which drives up prices and profits for the firms in business at the time increase.  

* But over time, Long-run equilibrium being steadfast, creeps back into play as more and more firms jump into the profitable market.  With an increase in firms, there is a shift in the supply, which leads to a decrease in price, but with the previous demand increase holding steady what we come out with is the same price with more firms producing an even greater quantity.

##Key Points:

* In the long-term, more firms generate lower prices and increased quantities.

* It would also seem that competitors mooch profits.

The example question in the video has a flaw and needs corrected!**
