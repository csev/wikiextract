##Notes for Week 4: 5.3 Taxes and Surplus

o	A tax is in incentive to stop trading that good

o	Trade and therefore social welfare is decreased (size of the market is decreased)

o	When taxes are imposed on both gasoline and luxury cars, the larger effect on social welfare comes from taxes on luxury cars.

When taxes are imposed on an inelastic market, the less effect the tax will have on social welfare and when taxes are imposed on an elastic market, the more effect the tax will have on social welfare.
