##Notes for Week 4: 3.1 Income Elasticity of Demand

Elasticity concept can be applied to other determinants of demand. 

Income elasticity of demand (IE) = % change of quantity demanded / % change in income
- $$\epsilon_x = \cfrac{\% change Q_x}{\% change I_x} = \cfrac{\% \Delta Q_x}{\% \Delta I_x}$$ <br>


IE can be both positive (for normal goods that are consumed more when income increases, e.g. personal cars) and negative (for inferior goods that are consumed less with higher income e.g. bus, public transport)

* Assuming your preferences stay the same:
 * Normal goods: income goes up, consumption goes up
 * Inferior goods: income goes up, consumption goes down (cheaper goods)

Special case where your preferences change with your income (i.e. - your income goes up but you want to become more environmental so you continue taking the bus)
