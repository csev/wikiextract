##Notes for Week 2: 1.2. The Market for Romantic Relationships

Price is influenced by both buyers and sellers.

Romantic partners are a limited resource so you can apply economic principles.

How does market work?
Hypothetically, let's assume males pursue females.
-- through conversation (low cost)
-- offer to buy female a drink (higher cost)
What determines cost?
What if you are the only male in the bar and there are many women in the bar? Male would have leverage and could just try striking up a conversation with one girl after the next.
What if there is only one woman in the bar?  Then the guy has to come up with something really good and possibly buy the girl a drink

The males' approach will be determined depending on how many males/females are in the bar.

### What happens to the incentive when 20 more girls enter the bar? ###

Male to female ratio is not trivial. How much power a male or female has in a relationship is a very important social issue which economics can help us to understand.

In summary, this lesson teaches us that when there is a higher demand of something (i.e. girls to chat with) you have higher cost (One has to impress the girl because there are many boys to choose from and hence one has to stand out. One could do this by buying the girl a drink, which has a higher cost than saying 'hi').
