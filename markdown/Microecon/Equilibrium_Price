## Notes for Week 2: 4.1. Equilibrium

There is a direct relationship between price and supply demanded.
There is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.

Finding an "equilibrium":

When price is too high, demand decreases, there is a downward pressure on price, and there becomes a supply surplus. When that happens, suppliers lower prices and eventually, demand increases again. This results in an upward pressure on price, prices increase, and a supply shortage develops. 

Finding the right balance between supply and demand is called the equilibrium situation. This is theoretical and ideal but may never happen. Itâ€™s also the point on the diagram where demand and supply curves intersect. The price at the intersecting point is equilibrium price. When price is not at equilibrium, there is always pressure for it to move toward equilibrium price. The equilibrium price is usually set by the rational behavior of buyers and sellers together.
