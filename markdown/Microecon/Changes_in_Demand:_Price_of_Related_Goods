## Notes for Week 2: 5.1. Changes in Demand: Price of Related Goods

Playing with the model the "what if game": we ask "what if...", ceteris paribus (anything else kept the same)

o	What if the price of bread goes up:

•	Supply of tomatoes won’t change (you don’t need bread to produce tomatoes)

•	Demand for tomatoes would change and would go down because of sandwiches being more expensive – demand shifts to the left

•	Price of tomatoes goes down (5), quantity of tomatoes will also be lower (5)

•	Downward pressure on price of tomatoes

o	What if the price of peppers goes down:

•	Supply of tomatoes won’t change

•	Demand for tomatoes would drop and demand shifts to the left

•	Price of tomatoes will follow as well as the quantity

•	Downward pressure on price of tomatoes
