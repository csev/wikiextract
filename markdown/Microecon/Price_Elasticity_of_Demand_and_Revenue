#Notes for Week 4: 2.2 Price Elasticity of Demand and Revenue

<b>Key words:</b>

- TR is <i>Total Revenue</I>
- P is Price
- Q is Quantity 

**Key Equation:**

Total Revenue = Price x Quantity (sold)

TR= PQ

##The price elasticity is classified as: elastic, inelastic or unitary.

1. Elastic: The price of demand of a good is larger than 1. (TR decreases)

2. Inelastic: The price of demand of a good is smaller than 1. (TR Increase)

3. Unitary: The price of demand of a good is equal to 1. (TR stays the same)

**Key concepts:**

1. A change in the price of a good whose demand is inelastic, always generates more revenue. 
2. An increase in price results in an increase in revenue,a decrease in price results in a decrease in revenue (unless the price is elastic).
3. So the revenue and cost go hand-in-hand. 
4. <i>Regarding an elastic demand:</i> An increase in price, generates less quantity of demand for a good, therefore total revenue goes down. And a decrease in the price of this elastic good produces an increased revenue.
