##Notes for Week 4: 4.2 Determinants of Price Elasticity of Supply

Example: tobacco and houses; which one has the more inelastic supply?

o	Tobacco is more elastic: it takes longer to change production of housing than change production of tobacco

o	In general, manufacturing is very elastic (itâ€™s just enough to hire more people if production needs to increase and the change happens quickly)

The main determinant is the time scale (time needed to adjust)


In Brief, Price Elasticity of Supply(PES)of a product depends on:
a) Time taken for producing it
b) Cost of altering its supply
c) Feasibility of storing it
