##Notes for Week 7: 2.1 Market Structures With Pricing Power

Market structures in which the business has some degree of market power, and that means they have some degree of control over the price are:

  * **Monopoly**. A market structure in which *one company* is the only seller of a product and if the product does not have close substitutes, it is unique. The fundamental cause of monopoly is *barriers to entry*, because other firms cannot enter the market and compete with it easily. How many sellers are there in the, in the industry? *0ne*. Is the product they sell differentiated? *Yes, it is unique*

  * **Oligopoly**. A market structure in which only a *few sellers* offer similar or identical products. As a result, the actions of any seller in the market can have a huge impact on the profits of all the others. Oligopolistic firms are *interdependent*. How many sellers are there in the, in the industry? *Few*. Is the product they sell differentiated? *Somewhat differentiated*

  * **Monopolistic Competition**. a market structure in which *many firms* sell products that are alike but not identical. In a monopolistically competitive market, each firm has a monopoly over its product, but many other companies produce similar products that compete for the same clients. How many sellers are there in the, in the industry? *Many*. Is the product they sell differentiated? *Somewhat differentiated*

##Key Note:
<i>All have the ability to control price to some degree.  This leads to a downward sloping demand curve.</i>
