#Notes for Week 8: 2.2 What type of good is this?
Public Goods Versus Common Goods

##Remember: 
* Public goods are non-rival and non excludable
* Common goods are rival but non excludable

##Categories Explained
* Determining if goods are public goods or private goods depends on the circumstances.  Some do not fall completely in a specific category, and can be in between two categories. As an example, in deciding whether something is a public good or a common resource, it should be determined who the beneficiaries are and whether these beneficiaries can be excluded from using the good and if rivalry exists.

* The goods that are not excludable: public goods and common resources, are closely related to the study of externalities. An *externality* is a cost or benefit which results from an activity or transaction and which affects an otherwise uninvolved party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Because the market cannot be prevented from using these goods, those are available to everyone free of charge. But, because something of value has no price attached to it, externalities arise. 

* Because of these external effects, private decisions about consumption and production can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, and government intervention can potentially raise economic welfare.

##Examples of Public, Common and Public/Common goods
* Voting (can be both a public and common good due to potential rivalries) Can't prevent someone from voting.
* Flu vaccines (are potentially public, common and private goods) (externalities)Your use will not affect someone else. But other people may benefit from your vaccination because you won't spread the diseases.
* Fighting poverty (is non-rival and non-excludable, therefore a public good) It's a good we should have, but markets have difficulty distributing.
* Fireworks (is non-rival and non-excluable, therefore a public good) As a public good it benefits the community because there is less danger than from private fireworks.
* Fishing (is rival, and non-excluable, therefore a common resource) Problem for markets to manage or distribute.

##Note:
Some a classified perfectly in one category, others are in between.
