#Notes for Week 6: 4.2 Long-run Competitive Output

##In a perfectly competitive market, what happens to the price in the long term?

<i>As more competitors move into a market, price will continue to go down until a point where profits shrink to an equilibrium with average total costs.</i>

##In the lecture the professor wrote two graphs, one for the market and one for the firm.

* In the firm graph, he listed price (in sync with market price), and quantity in terms of q (small q) which represented the number of firms in a given market.  He also plotted a marginal cost line and an average total cost line as well.

* In the market graph, he listed the quantity in terms of Q (big Q) and price P which was in sync with the firm graph.


* He then used the two graphs and plotted the price along both graphs.  He showed than as more firms entered the market the supply shifted to the right on the market graph, the price reduced and the quantity increased.  The shift continued until the price (P3) in the example, where marginal costs equaled average total costs.

###Competitive Market Equilibrium:
* This was the equilibrium point where there was no potential for further profit  represented in the following equation (P=ATC=MC).

**<i>The last point in the video, was that competitive markets lead to a reduction in price which is a boon for consumers and leads to a survival of the fittest take on business in a market.</i>**
