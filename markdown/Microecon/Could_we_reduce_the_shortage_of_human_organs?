##Notes for Week 3: 6.1. Could we reduce the shortage of human organs?

[[File:6.1 Could We Reduce the shortage of human organs.jpg]]

Every time we create an incentive for people to donate organs, we are moving the point towards the equilibrium.
* Such as marking a box in a driver's license

Notice that the surplus for society increases as the point is moved towards the right.  Before we only had surplus of A and B, but as the point moves right, we now have C and D too.
