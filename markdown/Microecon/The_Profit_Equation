##Notes for Week 6: 2.2 The Profit Equation

# Economic Profits vs Accounting Profits
**Accounting Profits** are *Revenue* minus *Operating Costs* and **Economic Profits** are *Revenue* minus *Operating Costs* minus *Opportunity Costs*.

This distinction is very important.

The example in the video showed:
* Salary         = $100
* Revenue        = $200
* Operating Cost = $100


##Accounting Profits
Using the formula Profits = R - TC  ($200-$100=$100)
* In this case the total costs did not include opportunity costs.

##Economic Profits
Using the formula Profits = R - TC  ($200-$100-$100=$0)
* In this case the total costs included the opportunity costs as well.
