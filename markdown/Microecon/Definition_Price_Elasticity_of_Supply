##Notes for Week 4: 4.1 Definition of Price Elasticity of Supply

Price elasticity of SUPPLY for $$E_x =\cfrac{\% change Q_X}{\% change P_X} = \cfrac{\% ∆ Q_x }{\% ∆ P_x}$$

[[File:4.4 Price Elasticity of Supply.png]]
* Inelastic: Change in price results in small change in quantity
* Elastic: Small change in price results in large changes in quantity

Examples:
PX = 10% 		EX = (% ∆ Qx )/(% ∆ Px) = (-5)/10 = -0.5
QX = 5%

PX = 10% 		EX = (% ∆ Qx )/(% ∆ Px) = (-15)/10 = -1.5
QX = 15%

* Classification:
 * Elastic (very responsive) = absolute value of E > 1
 * Inelastic (not very responsive) = absolute value of E < 1, 
 * Unitary = absolute value of E = 1
