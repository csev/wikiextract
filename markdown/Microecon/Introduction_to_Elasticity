##Notes for Week 4: 1.1. Introduction to Elasticity

<b>What is Elasticity?</b>

- How does it apply to normal business practice?

- In the video, the Black Dog Restaurant owner talked about his product line.  He sells variety of sandwiches including a Cuban pulled pork barbecue sandwich that he serves for $7.95.  He has to figure costs into his pricing.  After costs, he multiplies that by 3 to give the final price on a sandwich.

- When asked why he doesn't up the price he gave a very good primary reason:

- He doesn't want to decrease the number of customers coming into his shop.  Customers already have to wait in line for his food, which is one reason they may not come to his store.  He doesn't want to add another negative by raising prices.  He feels it's a good balance between profitability and price.
