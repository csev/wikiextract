## Notes for Week 2: 3.3. Price of an Input Changes


o	If prices of gasoline (input) goes up, the supply will go down (because it costs more to produce the tomatoes, you would require a higher price to cover the extra costs)

o	You cut the supply of tomatoes because it costs you more to supply tomatoes

o	The structure of the supply changes

o	The curve will shift to the left (donâ€™t use up or down as coordinates!)

Since gas is more expensive, the costs of producing tomatoes are higher. Every tomato you produce costs more. Therefore, if the cost of gasoline increases the supply will decrease. Whole supply structure changes. Supply curve shifts to the left.

When input costs decrease, supply will increase. (supply curve shift to the right)
