## Notes for Week 1: Net Marginal Benefit Principle

Rational people take an action only when the marginal benefits of that action are higher than the marginal costs.
If everyone behaves in this way society generates the most welfare (and as it's impossible in reality society will never maximize welfare).


The Net Marginal Benefit principle also indicates that a rational person will take the best action depending on their *current* situation, rather than taking the best course of action on an *average* of all situations.  For example, on average it is not wise for a person to quit their job without having another one, but in the situation that you won the lottery, it may be wise to do so.

Action is taken when <b><i>additional</i> benefits outweigh the costs</b> of that action.

Applying the Net Marginal Benefit principle to the list of Economics and Astronomy problems, the most rational choice to make would be to solve economics problem 1 in 5 minutes (cost). For the next problem to pick, there are now two equivalent choices - economics problem 2 costing 10 minutes and astronomy problem 1 also costing 10 minutes. The rational choice could be any of these which would then lead to the next set of choices.
This is of course assuming that a completed Economics problem and a completed Astronomy problem are of *equal value*.

<i>The Net Marginal Benefit Principle</i> is about making decisions based in the marginal (extra or additional) costs and/or benefits of making that decision - Salvador Gallegos Almaguer.

The Net Marginal Benefit Principle is when rational people make decisions based on if the extra benefits of an action are higher than the extra costs of that action. Dr. Vazquez mentioned in the video that people "make decisions based on marginal cost, not average cost." -Leah, Minnesota

Net Marginal Benefit Principle is  about how limited income forces choice. Consumers have to make choices about what goods will be purchased and not purchased. purchasing one item means that less funds are available to purchase other items- Jumoke Akhator.


The Net Marginal Benefit principle, is about the additional benefit that i get, when i decide purchased or choose any good. Is the additional benefit that this goodre presents to my welfare.

I buy one chocolate that costs me $5. That means I was very inclined to pay $5 for that chocolate and no other action could change my decision. Hence, my valuation for that chocolate is $5. When I buy 2 chocolates, suppose I am willing to pay $8. That means my valuation for 2 chocolates is $8. But, to buy that one extra chocolate costs me an additional $3. That means, my marginal valuation to buy that extra chocolate is $3. Although the average valuation is $4 per chocolate, I value the first one more than the second one.

The going rate for store detectives is $25 an hour. A store hires one detective, and she prevents $200 in shoplifting an hour. The store then hires a second detective, and the two detectives together prevent $300 in shoplifting an hour. Is the second detective worth it? Yes, since the marginal cost ($25) is less than the marginal benefit ($100). How many more detectives should the store hire? The store should keep hiring detectives until the added reduction in shoplifting is less than $25.

Excerpt from http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/microeconomics/marginal-benefit-cost.asp  "...Marginal benefit refers to what people are willing to give up in order to obtain one more unit of a good, while marginal cost refers to the value of what is given up in order to produce that additional unit. Additional units of a good should be produced as long as marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost. It would be inefficient to produce goods when the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost. Therefore an efficient level of product is achieved when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost."  -Jose Neftali Ramirez

If you purchase, say, a bundle deal from a telco comprising SMS, voice and data of specific quantities for a fixed monthly rate and you constantly exceed the data allocation because it is just not enough, incurring additional costs even when you don't derive the required benefits, you will likely opt out of the contract as soon as possible because the additional (marginal) cost doesn't provide a marginal benefit.

Basically put, the net marginal benefit principle states that a rational human being will continue to make a choice or take an action if MB > MC (marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost). - Diego A.

* **Net marginal benefit** : the next action you take is unrelated to the average cost, but decided by weighing its marginal (extra) benefits and marginal costs . - Dawn Tung, China
