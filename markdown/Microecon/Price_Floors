##Notes for Week 3: 5.2. Price Floors

[[File:5.2 Price Floors.jpg]]
Price floors: Set the price so that it can not go any lower.

•	Example: minimum wage (introduced in the ‘30s, with the New Deal; concept behind it: worker is selling his labor, that is worker is giving a supply)

o	The equilibrium price is $ 5 per hour

o	The government sets a minimum at $ 7.25 per hour

o	As a result, the number of available jobs (=demand for jobs) will decrease, from $$Q_1$$ to $$Q_3$$, while the workers willing to work (=supply of workers) will increase, from $$Q_1$$ to $$Q_2$$.  A Surplus of workers is created, thus unemployment.

o	The situation might be worse: the ones employed are better off, but there are many more unemployed ($$Q_1$$ - $$Q_3$$ are workers laid off due to higher price of workers)

o	The case is similar to the tomatoes in the storage: there is a surplus (8 – 4 = 4), therefore wages should decrease

o	Market cannot work this way if wages are not allowed to decrease for a government policy

o	Again, options are black market or similar

•	Minimum wage can have no effect if it’s below the equilibrium point (for example, 6 is equilibrium, 4 is set as minimum)

---

•	Another price floor that is very famous in the US is the price floor for agricultural resources like corn and milk

o	The government wants to maintain these industries in the country because they control the food supply of the country

o	Then we actually help those farmers by making sure that they can earn enough by selling their products so they don't have to face competition from other countries

o	The government basically pays the farmers enough so that the price or demand of milk or corn doesn't go down

o	This price is quite high, so price can actually go down because of competition from abroad and internationally

o	Whenever there is a surplus, the government buys it and destroys it, because, if the surplus goes back into the circulation, the prices would go down

---

•	Generally, price ceilings are more common than price floors
