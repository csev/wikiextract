##Notes for Week 7: 2.2 Sources of Market Power

#Barriers to Entry

A *barrier to entry* is when for some reason it is very difficult or impossible enter the market to sell a product or service. The main sources for *barriers to entry* are:
 
  * **Monopoly or Control of Resources**: A key resource for which there are no close
substitutes required for production is owned or control totally or almost totally by a single company. Then that company has control of the resource, it will be difficult for other companies to compete, and therefore, they will have some kind of market power.
  * **Technological Advantage**: Because the use of an innovative or breakthrough technology a single company can produce at a lower cost than all the other possible competing producers. As time progresses, the other competing companies can copy that technology capable breakthrough, and the company loses its market power, but for a time, technological improvement, it's a social market power.
  * **Government Regulation**: The government gives a single company or a small group of companies the exclusive right to produce or provide some good or service. Prime examples of this are the patent and copyright laws, because these laws give one producer a monopoly, they lead to higher prices for the product or service than could occur under free competition. But by allowing these monopoly producers to charge higher prices and earn higher profits, the laws also encourage innovation and other desirable behaviors.
  * **Product Differentiation**: In some way, the company has been able to create the idea in the consumer's mind that what they're selling is different. They are three basic ways to differentiate a product or service: style, location and quality. But the main way that companies create product differentiation is by advertising. The main reason the company is using advertising is to create the image in the consumers mind that the product is different.
  * **The Production Process - Natural Monopolies**: This is the more perverse source of market power and arise when there are economies of scale over the relevant range of output specially in the fixed costs. Then a single company can produce any given amount of output at least cost. That is, for any given amount of output, a larger number of companies leads to less output per company and higher average total cost. Thus, the average total cost of the product is lowest if a single company serves the entire market. This is a source of monopoly in which it is really difficult to enter the market, because the company have to pay so huge upfront. But even if the government allows to, try to breaks them up, they will reconvene, because those fixed costs are still there and they will try to reduce them by producing more output. So in the end it is really the long run classic source of market power and it is so perverse that economists classify this as a *market failure* in a sense that this is a situation in which free markets are in fact a problem. Because they will inherently give
incentive to companies to merge and that will be bad for society.
