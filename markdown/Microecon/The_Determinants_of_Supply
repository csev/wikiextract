## Notes for Week 2: 3.1. The Determinants of Supply

<h2><b>How much you are willing to sell is affected by:</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>Selling Price - what you can get for tomatoes</li>
<li>Cost to produce/sell - gasoline for transport, labor etc. The price of input needed to supply tomatoes</li>
<li>Technology - tractor, fertilizer etc.  Advancements in technology reduces cost of production. When cost of production goes down, you are able to produce more by using the same amount of resources. </li>
</ol>
<b>Key points:</b>
<ul>
<li>The better the technological increase the greater the reduction in cost of production.</li>
<li>Supply side of the market is really the cost side of the market.</li>
<li>When costs (to produce) increase, supply decreases.</li>
<li>When costs (to produce) decrease, supply increases.</li>
</ul>
