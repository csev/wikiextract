Maximizing Profit: the goal of any firm (in this course, anyway)

Profit = Revenue - Costs
pi = Profit
R = Revenue
C = Costs

Note: accounting profit is different than economic profit.
Accounting profit may be $100/day, while economic profit is zero:
Salary: $100/day
Revenues: $200/day
Operating Costs: $100/day

Acct Profit = 200-100 = $100/day
Economic Profit = 200-100-100 = $0/day

Economic Profit includes opportunity costs.
It makes sense for a business to stay open with no economic profit.  Everyone is getting paid, yay!

Profit = (Price - ATC) * Quantity

If Marginal Cost > Marginal Revenue, then total profits will be lower, and production should be cut.  When MR = MC, then peak profit is reached, don't need to change anything.

Firms are "Price Taking Producers" (or simply Price Takers) if there is perfect competition, and if they are selling a commodity.  They have no control over price, or the customer will go elsewhere.  If you can differentiate yourself or your product, you are a price maker.

Lots of chart work, hard to do in plain text, sorry!  (On my handwritten notes)

Firms always produce at a point along the marginal cost curve.  Where Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost intersect, that's equilibrium.  If producing higher quantity, then the seller pulls in higher price, and follows the marginal cost curve up, and the difference between the marginal cost curve and the average total cost is his profit.

Discussed long and short term arrangements.  In the short term, fixed costs are sunk costs.  In the long term, market will react, with more or less supply (more or fewer sellers), thus returning the price to the global minimum of the Average Total Cost.

The Long Run Supply (LRS) or Long Run Supply Curve (LRSC) is the line between the current or old equilibrium point and the new equilibrium point.  If this is flat, then you're in a constant cost industry.  More interesting is a Decreasing or Increasing Cost Industry.  In a decreasing cost industry, the more producers there are, the lower the costs for those producers.  Think of the car companies.  The more car companies there are, the better equipment the equipment makers will make, and in higher quantity, thus probably offering to the car companies at lower prices.  In this case, competition is very good for the seller.  We also call this achieving Economies of Scale.
