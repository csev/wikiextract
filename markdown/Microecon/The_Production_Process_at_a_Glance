##Notes for Week 5: 2.2 The Production Process at a Glance

##Inputs in Production Process
###The tennis balls production demonstration is reviewed to present new concepts: <b>fixed inputs and variable inputs.</B>

 * [Fixed inputs][]*: the inputs that are maintaining the same in the different iterations of the production process, as expenses are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced for the relevant period. Sometimes also are call *Capital*
 
 * [Variable Inputs][]*: the inputs that are/could be different for each iteration of the production process, as expenses that change in proportion to the activity of the level of goods or services produced for the relevant period.  Sometimes also are call *Labor*

###Because this classification is based on the time period those two definitions are important (It's is an error in the video, both concepts are presented twisted):

 * [Long-run][2]*: All inputs are variable.

 * [Short-run][2]*: Some inputs are fixed.

 * Economists tend to label variable inputs as labor, and fixed inputs as capital in the form of: (plants, place and machine)
