#Notes for Week 7: 5.1 The Social Cost of Market Power

##Problems with Market Power

- Are there any problems with Market Power when a company has complete or partial power in a market?

- There was a graph in the video that illustrated the differences in prices in a monopoly based market which was then compared to a market with perfect competition.  
- The end result is that the monopoly produces less quantity at a higher price. The difference between the quantity in a perfectly competitive market and the quantity in a market where there is a monopoly is the social cost.  

- *However, no one gets surpluses from the gains of a monopoly from trades that were not made.* 

- *Price discrimination can allow monopolies to offer more goods at varying prices thus reducing social cost because more people can now afford the good.*

## There are many other kinds of market failures.  

###The three types of market failures to be discussed:

- 1)  Monopolies
- 2)  Public Goods
- 3)  Externalities
