## Notes for Week 1: User-Contributed Definitions of Economics

Before we define <b>Economics</b> we should define <i>Economy</i>. IMPORTANT!
economy: is the social science that study how the people handle all little resource for all needs


* <b>Economy</b> is a system for coordinating society's productive activities (activities that produce the goods and services people want) with the people who want them.


*****

* <b>Economics</b> is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.  Mankiw, Kneebone & McKenzie (Principles of Microeconomics)

* <b>Economics</b> is all about finding the most efficient way to distribute a scarce resource. - Nobel

* <b>Economics</b> is the science or the study of how to distribute limited resources to satisfy the needs of the people. - *Isidro Cedano*

* <b>Economics</b> help you decide the best option for distributing your resources.

* <b>Economics</b> is defined as: The study of production and consumption of goods and the transfer of wealth to produce and obtain those goods. 

* <b>Economics</b> is part of our daily lives and part of our country's economy. From Financial Products, resources, etc. - Janessa

* <b>Economics</b> is the science studying how to make decision rationally. - Steve

* <b>Economics</b> is the study of the science of the allocation of limited resources to satisfy the *demands* of people. The demands are unlimited and the resources are limited. This leads to *scarcity* which is the basic *economic problem* that economists are attempting to solve. The resources are the inputs that produce goods and services  which make up an economy. These resources include land, labour, capital（i.e. machinery, building and other man-made productive assets) and human capital (i.e. skills of workers). Simply put, <b>Economics</b> is the social science that studies the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.

* **Economics** allows us to best determine how resources are distributed in society.

* **Economics** is the study that is aimed at increasing value through trading.

* **Economics** is the study of determining an efficient allocation of limited resources to meet its demand. It answers the question of how to distribute resources efficiently. It is also defined as the study of how to efficiently distribute limited resources so that it benefits best those who would value it most.

* **Economics** is the study of how people choose to use resources. - Angelica Lima

* **Economics** is a social science that analyzes the production, consumption and distribution of goods and services. Economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business, finance, health care, and government. - Shilpi Gupta

* **Economics** as a social science arises because human wants are numerous, but the resources to satisfy these human wants are limited. It is therefore important to allocate these scarce/limited resources in the most efficient way.

* **Economics** is study of how best to transform the resources at ones disposal to products / services that provide the best (or combination) utilization to one and all, given it scarce nature. - Lewis                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

* **Economics** is the discipline that studies the way of allocating limited resources effectively. - Lusine

* **Economics** is the science to study value, weightage and behavior of distribution of resources against the desired necessity. Mudassar Khalid

* **Economics** is the science guiding people to allocating limited resources efficiently. The word "efficiently" is the essence that drives people to think about optimization. - Miles Luo

* **Economics** is the study of the production and consumption of goods and the transfer of wealth to produce and obtain those goods. Economics explains how people interact within markets to get what they want or accomplish certain goals. Since economics is a driving force of human interaction, studying it often reveals why people and governments behave in particular ways. There are two main types of economics: macroeconomics and microeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individuals and industries, like the dynamics between buyers and sellers, borrowers and lenders. Macroeconomics, on the other hand, takes a much broader view by analyzing the economic activity of an entire country or the international marketplace. - Rafiudeen Khan, INDIA

* **Economics** as a social science is a study of Human Behaviour in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of wellbeing. - Jumoke Akhator, Nigeria

* **Economics** is the study of allocation of resources. Since resources are scarce and human needs are endless we need a mechanism to solve this problem of allocation. So it deals with production. consumption and distribution of scarce resources so that maximum benefit can be attained. - Savitri Joshi 

* **Economics** is trying to figure out the most efficient way to distribute resources that will generate the greatest beneficial outcome. In doing this, you must take into account many factors including: <b>scarcity of resources, access to resources </b> and among many other factors the <b>value of the resources.</b> It is not necessarily dealing with money but can also pertain to time and value of goods.

* **Economics** is the science of decisions.

* **Economics** is the study of how people make choices to use scarce resources <b>in order to satisfy their wants.</b> - Shweta -- (Interesting!!!)

* **Economics** is social science. Social because it involves people and their way of living and preferences.Science, because it displays the scientific methods used in improving the living standards of the individuals and groups. -Deep Maity.

* **Economics** is the study which shows how to distribute limited resources in the most efficient way.

* **Economics** is the study of efficiently distributing limited resources based on the <b>perceived value </b> and <b> use </b> of those resources <b> based on </b> the <b> resources' recipients. </b> - Diana Henderson 

* **Economics** is a way to distribute limited resources. - Rose C., Long Beach, CA (continued below in *Various Interpretations*)

* **Economics** is the art of applying limited information in an uncertain environment to achieve the best possible outcomes in a limited decision time space. Since everything has a cost the amount of time to decide and gather information about the best possible outcome is out of scope. The direct proportionality of information and decision making is very evident, but all that leads to increase in cost and that opportunity itself may cease to exist. For example, a consulting firm is bidding for a project and the bidding process time is finite thus the consulting firm has to base its decisions in that limited time with limited information which may or may not be the best possible outcome. Thus decision making in economics is not to be thought as perfect and precise as these assumptions would anyway be faulty. -Md Aslam Khan, INDIA

* In my view, **economics** is the study of the choices made by people in allocating their resources to satisfy their desires. Sometimes these resources are quantified as money but the problems cannot always be translated into pounds, shillings and pence. Equally, economics is not necessarily a way of finding the most efficient or effective way of allocating these resources. <b> As an area of study, it will describe the differing ways in which choices are made and resources are allocated but the value judgements associated with these choices will be different from person to person and in differing situations and timeframes.</b>

* As everyone has said, **economics** is a social science that studies how to allocate limited resources in the best way to satisfy individuals or societies needs. The problem is, as it is a social science, it can not forecast the future, it studies the past and explain what the mistakes were, but it can not prevent us for future economics wrong decisions. - Rafael Navarrete, Spain.

* **Economics** is the optimized solution to a problem which has equations consisting variables of tangible, limited and scarce resources like money, time, etc...    - Rohith, India

* **Economics** is an art of trade-off.  - George Range, China.

* Distribute the limited resources to achieve the best result. There are many ways to allocate resource and economics is the method to the most efficient way. Since most of the things on earth is limited, so actually economics is around us. -liulu
[[Category:Microecon|What is Economics?]]

* **Economics** is the science that allows us to understand how to allocate the resources in the best way possible to satisfy our needed. We use economics in every fields of our lives, even if we are thinking not using it.


* **Economics** is the science that studies the distribution of scarce resources among competing options in the best possible way. - Obiora


* **Economics** is everywhere time is of essence. When we are limited by or have limited of, economics is essential in making sure whatever we have is well used. Everything is about timing and resources, and during turmoil I think its important to stick to the basics. - Ankit Sheth

* **Economics** is the study of how goods & services can be used to buy other goods and services that people, cities and nations need. Economics has the power to change the financial landscape of a nation, even the power to bring it down. When demand of one person's or nations' product is no longer needed, either they must find a new product to produce to sustain or face a major financial crisis. - Ross B.

* **Economics,** in Dr. Vazquez's scenario, seems to be how to allocate a service in the most efficient way. - Leah, Minnesota

* **Economics** is the art of providing for the wants of a society through the efficient allocation of scarce/limited resources.  It is simply using what is available to meet the demands of the people. - Yemisi Adewunmi Nigeria.

* **Economics** evolve with the times they refer to. Back in 19th century until recently, Economics, often called political economy, intended to recognize patterns which could be analyzed and explained regarding the way humans interact with each other and their environment in the making of goods, allocation of labor and money,  and incentives to do business, psychological links and social consequences of these interactions. Whether we talk about Adam Smith, Karl Marx or John Mayard Keynes, every one of them has brought new elements to the understanding of what was happening at the time making it possible to predict the future. Serge from Cameroon
* **Economics** is the science that studies the relationship between diffrent social variables through specific methadology and tools. -Aya

* **Economics** is the discipline studying economic activities in society like if you want to get something you have to give something too, on the process between get and give there is many activities such as production, distribution and consumption. - Rudy Indonesia.

* **Economics** is the best way to live safety in a society capitalist. - Milton
##Various Interpretations

* To agree with what has already been stated many times, **economics**, and in this case, microeconomics, can be described as more than one way to distribute limited resources, and then narrowing it down to the best option(s) for that distribution. That being said, there will almost always be variability when seeking out the aforementioned "best option", as there will always be a difference in opinions, morals, and values, among other things, when it comes to people in general. The options can be weighed by pro's and con's and, in the big picture, the weight of one option will out-do another (such as voting for the American President, or voting for a specific law). But on a smaller scale, the way my home is ran might not be the same as the way you run your home, and therefore there becomes more variability when there are more options and choices available. Also, economics doesn't just cover distribution, money, or any specific "item(s)", but it encompasses a greater horizon of choices to be made and how those choices will affect the world around us. - Holly Mashburn

* I think **economics** is the study of the science (and differences) of distributing finite resources amongst a diverse market by the most efficient or productive/profitable means possible. --Harry Perrier.

* **Economics** is a social science teaching people how to view the things in different and efficient ways. - Dawn Tung, China

*****

* <b>THE INTERESTING VICIOUS CYCLE:</b> Economics is about resource allocation. We allocate resources based on desired outcome. Preferred outcome is determined by values that we hold dear. Values are shaped by information that we believe. But we invest time to get information only on what we value. If critical mass of humanity allocates scarce resources based on wrong values, we collectively get wrong outcome.

* <b>QUESTIONS:</b> 

1. How do we develop foolproof tools that link wrong outcomes directly to wrong economic choices? 

2. How does society develop the will power to change wrong choices that are incriminated in wrong outcomes?  - Jeremiah, Nigeria

3. If we define economics as the study of societies dealing with scarcity of resources such as time or money, is the study of economics more about the allocation decisions themselves, how we make these decisions, which best decisions are best, or rather what these decisions say about our values and reasoning? - Meridian Witt, Washington DC
 
Response: In a command economy, Economics is about the allocation decisions themselves; in the market economy it is about how individuals decide.  Society debates (in its political arena)  which decisions are “best” and uses economic analysis to decide how to influence the system to achieve better outcomes.  Microeconomic analysis shows what the decisions say about our values and reasoning.  Individuals can use that analysis to become more aware of decision making habits, include hidden costs in their cost-benefit analysis, and see their social impact. –D Pasta, Seattle

4. I also wonder the definition of best: does best refer to what is best for society? individual person? best through different ethical, moral, or logical perspectives/philosophies? Is the best economist the one who acknowledges and explores the cost and benefits of decision from the most perspectives? - Meridian Witt, Washington DC


* Just wanted to say those are great questions Meridian Witt from DC, I believe thats one of the challenges of economics, since allocation and values are subjective, and vary widely from country or even from person to person making decisions for shared resources its complex as compared to making decisions for any action you personally can do. Should our decisions be individualists as Classic Economists hold?. Economics is based on how people make decisions based on the information and desires they have at an specific moment, but each moment is different and involves different factors thus making it hard to make an objective decision. Should we have more socialy-aware decision making habits? And make decisions based on the social benefit outcome? - Arturo, Mexico.

* Economics is, basically, about allocation of scarce resources to meet human demands which are un limited. So, it's like a trade-off between resources depletion and meeting human wants. Economics,at deeper level, is blend of other disciples like Human psychology, Science of resources formation, Ecology etc. And Hi, JEREMIAH from Nigeria! I really liked your question,"How does society develop the will power to change wrong choices that are incriminated in wrong outcomes?" And I couldn't help but thinking about it. I think collective awareness about the bad outcomes make the contribution. ~ Tanushree Sharma.
Hello Tanushree Sharma I am Jason from China. As far as I am concerned, the society sometimes does fail to recognize their bad decisions and there is no way a single individual can fight this. In Game Theory when the so-called "wise option" that maximizes societal welfare is in fact a dominated strategy for individuals, there simply is no way for turning this trend.
*****

* Not trying to be negative, but it seems to me that for every resource that is limited, there will be a controlling "hand" or influence that determines for the rest of us the value or price that everyone else pays for that resource.

* Prices might be determined by firms, but ultimately it's us who buy the products that decide if the price of a product is at the right value and thus we decide to buy it or not, or buy a substitute/alternative product. And if we dig a bit deeper, what we value is determined by the way we think and the social context we are in, we all value gold, precious metals, luxury items and such, but thats just a way of thinking or the value we as a colective society have for things, if we all as a colective society would value clean non-polluted air, for example, we would be more concerned on how to achieve that and thus we would place our resources on achieving that gold. It is the things we value, based on our beliefs that drives the production, distribution of goods, etc. so economics its more of a tool that helps in many scenarios of decision making and such, but i believe we do have the "power" on deciding what we do with our resources, what do we value the most? having luxury items and a luxury lifestyle that will not be for everyone (again all resources are scarce) or maybe working towards having a less polluted world that we can all be better with. Arturo, from Mexico.

* When a resource is limited, then there is always more than one way to distribute it. Certain items are intangible--e.g. time, personal preferences, ethics and values--and must be considered when assessing cost, supply and/or demand.

*****

* In the economy we see the use of the opportunity cost, find out what the result of using an option or other basis of our limited resources and know which will be the end result when using an option or other knowing that there are many options which use our resources. - Ambriz.A.

* If you are a good economist, you will  be able to make better decisions as a citizen, whatever the gravity and size of the decision. - Arka

In answer to part of Q.4, (I also wonder the definition of best: does best refer to what is best for society? individual person? best through different ethical, moral, or logical perspectives/philosophies?) based on my understanding of what I have seen/read so far I would suggest that - assuming we fully accept Adam Smith's invisible hand principle - then self-interest is always the best guiding force as to what a rational individual's action should be, and results in the best outcomes for society (although we may argue as to what is best for society). This is also assuming that we allow an extremely broad interpretation of self-interest to allow for the "different ethical, moral, or logical perspectives/philosophies" which you mention. Thus, in the example of the old car and new car rental: Person A seeks to spend less money by buying a car with less upfront costs (because they use the car less, therefore clock up fewer miles, so gasoline costs are less important to them than the cost of the car) - whereas an imaginary person B who clocks up say 50,000 miles a year would be better off financially if they chose the new car with greater miles per gallon in order to reduce their massive fuel costs. Thus, Person A takes the old car, both saving money and taking it out of circulation therefore preventing a less fossil fuel-conscious user from renting it; while Person B makes a choice which will also save them money and result in the use of less fossil fuel than if they had chosen the older car. Both drivers achieve their economic and ethical objectives.

From a broader perspective this allows the government to use gasoline prices as a lever to stimulate a change in behavior amongst consumers by altering the fossil fuel price through taxation, thus encouraging the outcome outlined above. I would say that this approach is taken to some degree by the UK government, although they are also motivated by the desire to receive increased tax revenues, while the US government is traditionally less concerned about fossil fuel usage (and in any case US drivers in general clock up significantly more miles than UK drivers due to the massive difference in scale of each country, so increased taxation would be extremely unpopular and possibly detrimental to overall economic growth in the US.) 

However, one aspect of this which is not considered is the fossil fuel cost of actually producing the cars - I'm not actually sure of the precise effects of this externality. Maybe someone else can pick up on this?

* All resources are limited.  The example the Instructor gives is his class.  The Instructor is the limited resource in this case.  He gives three examples of how economics would work:  1) To make the class free allows for all the students to have the same access to the instructor and to have an equal chance to do well in the class.  2) To make the class available only to students that can pay the most, allows for those students who really want the class, and to have the Instructor's attention.  3) To make the class available through a lottery, where only certain students, picked at random, are given the opportunity to attend the class and to have the Instructor's attention.  But what if one of the students picked doesn't really want to take the class and drops out after 2 weeks; another student who really wanted to take the class didn't get chosen and would have not dropped the class.  This is an example of a wasted resource.  The reality is that the limited resource (the Instructor) should go to the ones (the students) who value it the most. - Rose C., Long Beach, CA (continued from above in *User-Contributed Definitions*)

*****

* It seems to me that economics serves to choose the best and most efficient course of action for the use of resources (limited or unlimited)...I just wonder what might be the drivers in Economics for making such choices....fairness? efficiency? Ideology? all of them? - Carlos, UK

*****

* The drivers are the objectives you want to achieve. They will determine the (ideological, ethical) nature of the choices, decisions, and ways of achievement. - Laura, Spain

*****

* Economics is a counterweight which automatically help to balance resources and needs.  -Wanhui, China

*****
* Economics* is the study that allows to choose the best option, not necessarily monetary, to allocate resources in the most beneficial way without a high cost to the dealer and receiver. *Jaime Valbuena, Colombia.
