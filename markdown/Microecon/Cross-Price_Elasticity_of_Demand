##Notes for Week 4: 3.2 Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand


Cross-price elasticity of demand= % change of quantity of product X demanded / % change in price of related product Y
- $$\epsilon_x = \cfrac{\% change Q_x}{\% change P_y} = \cfrac{\% \Delta Q_x}{\% \Delta P_y}$$ <br>


* For products that are complements, E. is negative: if price of a complement Y goes up, consumed quantity of good X decreases.
 * Example: pizza and beer are complements.  
  * y = pizza
  * x = beer
  * So if the price of pizza goes up (say 10%), then $$\Delta P_y = 10 \%$$ <br>
  * Since pizza is a complement of beer,demand for beer goes down when price of pizza goes up, so $$Q_x = -10 \%$$ <br>
  * Therefore, the cross-price elasticity, $$\cfrac{\% \Delta Q_x}{\% \Delta P_y}$$, is negative


<br>
* For products that are substitutes, E. is positive: if price of substitute Y goes up, demanded quantity if good X increases.
