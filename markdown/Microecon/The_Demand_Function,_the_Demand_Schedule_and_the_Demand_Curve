## Notes for Week 2: 2.2. The Demand Function, Schedule, and Curve

Use math to organize thinking

$$Q_x = f(P_x, P_y,I, T)$$

$$Q_x$$ - Quantity demand for x (Tomatoes) <br>
$$P_x$$ - Price of x (Tomatoes) <br>
$$P_y$$ - Price of related good y (e.g., bread or red bell peppers) <br> 
I  - Income of consumers <br>
T  - Tastes or preferences of consumers
<br>

###Demand Schedule###
**Relationship of Demand to Price** <br>
Px Qx <br>
0  12 <br>
2  10 <br>
4  8 <br>
6  6 <br>
8  4 <br>
10 2 <br>
12 0

All other things equal/unchanged

Tomato Example 
Diagram (graph) 
X = Qx
Y - Px

forms straight line (demand curve) with negative slope

*****
Qx = f(Px,Py, I, T)

where...
Qx = quantity of "x" supply; Px = x's price; Py = price of related goods; I = income; T = preferences

Demand Scale: 
-inverse proportion
-as Px (price) rises, Qd (quantity of demand) falls, and vice versa

For those familiar with graphs: 
The demand curve is a line of y = -x + b; where b is the Qd (quantity of demand), while the Px (price) is 0
*****

In conclusion, the demand graph is one of the key fundamentals that should be learned in Economics. It compares **<i>quantity</i> demanded for a particular good with the price of that particular good**.

### Law of Demand ###
When the price of a given good goes up and all the other things stay the same, the consumption of this good decreases. And vice-versa.
