#Notes for Week 6: 4.4 The Long-run Supply Curve

We continued on with the idea of the long-run supply curve (LRSC).

There was an assumption that the lowest point on the ATC (Average Total Cost) curve doesn't change regardless of any change in the market.  This is an overreaching assumption.

##There are actually three types of change in industries.

A) Constant Cost Industry:
An industry where regardless of the number of added firms, the cost remains the same.
* LRSC is sloped zero (prices will return to equilibrium regardless of number of firms)

B) Decreasing Cost Industry:
An industry where adding new firms to the total number of firms, decreases the costs.
* LRSC is sloped downwards
* Example: Computers, TV (more companies gives firms more incentive to produce more effectively)

<br>
C) Increasing Cost Industry:
An industry where adding new firms leads to an increase in costs.
* LRSC is sloped upwards
* Example: Oil (any industry where the resource is limited and/or it is difficult to obtain the commodity)
