#Notes for Week 3: 2.1. What is Consumer Surplus?

- Measure happiness and benefits of inhabitants in units of measure, for example, the dollar.

- Consumer Surplus is the difference between what you are willing to pay and actual price paid.

##For any good, your willingness to pay has to be higher than the price you pay for a consumer surplus to occur.

<I>[Consumer Surplus]= (Willingness to pay) - (Price)</I>

- If prices fall at the same WTP (willingness to pay), the consumer surplus rises.

- If prices rise at the same WTP (willingness to pay), the consumer surplus falls.

<b>Said another way:</b>

An increase in price, lowers consumer surplus.

A decrease in price, raises consumer surplus.

[[Category:Microecon|What is Consumer Surplus?]]

<b>Consumer welfare</b> is the result of a change in consumer surplus.  If Consumer Surplus (CS) increases, then Consumer welfare increases, and if CS decreases, then Consumer welfare decreases.
