1) Opportunity cost: there's some discrepancy here between the simple definition (the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative forgone (that is not chosen)) and the definition that the prof gave (the difference between the value and the cost derived from a choice not taken)

2) Marginal benefits and costs: don't use the average cost or benefit in a decision, use the marginal cost - the next cost that would be incurred or benefit to be derived.

3) Invisible hand: people acting individually yields better result for all society; example 1 is prices to motivate behaviors, example 2 is people in lines at the supermarket.

4) Trade creates value: items have different value for different people at different times. If we trade to line these up, value is created (seemingly out of nowhere).
