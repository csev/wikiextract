##Notes for Week 3: <b>3.2. Producer Surplus and the Supply Curve</b>

<i>Producer Surplus = Price - Willingness to Sell</i>

##<b>Key Ideas:</b>

- Cost is another word for the supply curve.  How many consumers are willing to buy a good at different prices.

- Between the price and the supply curve (aka left of the supply curve under the price)

- Direct relationship between the price and the area of the producer surplus
    *<i>Price increase= more Producer Surplus ($30 level vs $20)</i>

    *<i> Price decrease= less Producer Surplus ($10 level vs $20)</i>.

##<b>Producer Surplus is the inverse of Consumer Surplus</b>

- The more something costs, the less consumers want to consume it. 
- The less something costs, the less producers want to produce it.

##<b>Producer welfare is a change in producer surplus</b>

-If producer surplus (PS) increases, then producer welfare increases, and if PS decreases, then producer welfare decreases.
