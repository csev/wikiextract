##Notes for Week 3: 5.1. Price Ceilings

[[File:5.1 Price Ceilings.jpg]]

•	Example: market for apartments: 

o	The equilibrium price for a 1-room apartment is $600

o	The government sets a ceiling of $400

o	The number of renters raises ($$Q_2$$), while the number of landlords declines ($$Q_3$$)

o	The result of this policy is that a smaller number of apartments would be rented ($$Q_3 < Q_1$$)

o	The case is similar to the tomatoes shortage: there are people standing in line (8 – 4 = 4), therefore prices should increase

o	Market cannot work this way if prices are not allowed to increase for a government policy

o	Landlords can therefore charge larger prices for utilities (it’s a legal way to increase the price), decrease the quality of the apartments, or rent them on the black market
