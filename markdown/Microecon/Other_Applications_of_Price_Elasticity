* Note that the Demand for drugs is inelastic (price is extremely sensitive to quantity)
* When government cracks down on the quantity of drugs sold $$Q_2 - Q_1$$, the resulting price of the drug, $$P_2 - P_1$$, is really big. 
* Consequently, the revenue the drug dealers receive is even greater than before, giving them even more incentive to deal drugs

* Price of crops is also inelastic (because we need them to survive, so we'll have to pay for it regardless of price)
* When farmers became more productive, the produced more quantity of crops, effectively shifting the Supply curve to the right.
* But the marginal increase in the quantity supplied caused a major decrease in the price of the crop.
