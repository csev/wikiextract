#Notes for Week 7: 4.2 Imperfect Price Discrimination

Imperfect price discrimination occurs when companies can't separate customer's willingness to pay exactly but they still try to estimate willingness to pay and charge different prices for goods and services.

##Examples:  

###Happy Hour at a bar.  

When you go to a bar during normal hours you pay a premium to drink that beer.  But during happy hour you get a discount.  It is because the time for happy hour is not optimal for drinking alcohol, therefore to attract more customers the price is reduced even though the product is the same.

###Movie Theater Tickets

When you go to the movie you often have to pay the normal price for a ticket.  However if you are a member of certain groups, namely senior citizens or students then a discount is applied to entice those members to purchase more tickets.  Further if you attend a movie matinee you are given a discount as well.  This is because most people don't watch movies in the matinee hours.

###Coupons

When you go shopping you have the ability to reduce your cost for goods and services through coupon usage.  You have to put some time into collecting and cutting out coupons but you then wind up paying less for the same products and services.

##THE MASTERS OF PRICE DISCRIMINATION:

###The Airlines

You are charged different prices depending on your purpose of travel whether it is leisure or business. 

* Business travelers:  Have inflexible schedules and a higher willingness to pay.  They also tend to purchase their tickets around 2 weeks in advance and don't stay over a Saturday.

* Leisure travelers:  Have flexible schedules and a lower willingness to pay.  they tend to purchase their tickets several months in advance and generally stay over a Saturday.

Thus, business travelers pay more for the same tickets than leisure travelers do on a flight.


##Example:

Which ones of these is NOT price discrimination? A publishing company charging more for a book when it first comes out OR Insurance charging more to insure red cars than white cars

Answer: Insurance company charging more to insure red cars than white car. This is because statistically, people who buy red cars are considered risk takers and get into more accidents than people who buy white cards. Therefore the cost to provide services is different, which means it's NOT price discrimination.
