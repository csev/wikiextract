Costs fall into two groups, They are separated based on time scale - fixed costs can be changed, but only on a long timescale, whereas variable costs could vary on a small time scale.

Fixed costs (aka Capital Costs):
 Land
 Equipment - tractor, oven, nuclear reactor

Variable costs (aka Labor Costs):
 Workers
 Fertilizer
 Ingredients to prepare food

Production Function: The relationsihp between the quantity of inputs a firm uses and the quantity of outputs it produces.

Total Product Curve: Quantity vs. Workers (or other Variable input)
This will be a curve with a negatively changing slope (starts out vertical, growing but becoming horizontal, in a frowny face shape)

Total Cost Curve: Total Cost (sum of variable and fixed costs) vs. Quantity
NOTE: the Quantity has moved from the y axis to the x axis.
This will be a curve with a postively changing slope (starts out horizontal, slowly growing, but becoming vertical, in a smile shape).
The slope of this curve is the marginal cost (different at each point on the curve, obv), and is calculated by delta_TC over delta_Q = MC (Marginal Cost).  This is directly related to the marginal production of the variable input.

Note: the marginal cost curve always crosses the average total cost curve at the lowest point of the average total cost curve.

AFC = Average Fixed Costs = FC/Q

AVC = Average Variable Costs = VC/Q

ATC = AFC + AVC

Tip: Focus on marginal costs more than average costs.
