##Notes for Week 7: 4.1 Perfect Price Discrimination

Charging different prices to different consumers is a winning situation for the company. Because will obtain higher profits and also it will be good for consumers because more people will afford to buy the product or service.

**Price discrimination** is when the seller with market power is able to charge different prices for the same good or services to different consumers. And it should have to prevent resales. 

**Perfect price discrimination** describes a situation in which the company knows exactly each customerâ€™s willingness to pay and can charge each customer a different price based on that. The use of list price that could be negotiated is a way to discriminate the willingness for paying a price for a product or service.


An example=selling cars. A salesperson will negotiate with a customer until both sides reach an agreement in price. The price will probably be different for each customer depending on their willingness to pay. The result is more people buy can buy cars at their price point and car dealerships will sell more cars and make more profit.
