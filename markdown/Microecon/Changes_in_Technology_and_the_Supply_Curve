## Notes for Week 2: 3.4. A Change in Technology


A supply change in technology can be quantified and charted on a supply curve.  An example of a technological improvement could be a tractor that helps produce more of a particular vegetable with the same amount of acreage.  Instead of producing 20 pounds you are now averaging 40 pounds of vegetables, thus doubling the supply quantity.

Any increase or improvement in technology that brings costs down (as you can pass on your savings to the consumers) is going to lead to a shift right on a supply curve.  The opposite holds true, though generally is unlikely, that a downshift in technology that brings costs up is going to lead to a shift to the left on a supply curve.

(Pragya) There is a cost associated with Technology (and that is a considerable cost) should that be accounted for when considering the cost of production.
(Bhargava) 
When we change the technology and if it costs more (or cheaper), it shall be taken into consideration.
But for our discussion in the course, the first assumption of Ceteris paribus remain unchanged.
While we are in the concept of "Changes in Technology" vs "Supply", the Change in Technology to our case implies that there is a change in technology at the cost of earlier technology, i.e., change in technology is applied at no additional cost. 
Hence, in our scenario here, when the change in technology increases (or decreases) the quantity produced, the Supply Curve shifts to the right (or left).
