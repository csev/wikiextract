##Notes for Week 8: 5.2 Positive Externalities

Externalities can also be positive – e.g. if someone does up their house then they increase the value of the other houses in the neighbourhood.

Flu shots = another example due to herd immunity 

When the actions of one agent affects the welfare of other agents in a positive way and there are no changes in compensation then it is a positive externality

When you have a positive externality that is not taken into account in the costs, then the free market will not produce enough of a good thing. If you don’t compensate people for carrying out actions that lead to positive externalities then not enough people will do so
