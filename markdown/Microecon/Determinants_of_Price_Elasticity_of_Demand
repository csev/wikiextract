##Notes for Week 4: 2.3 Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand
2 things determine elasticity demand:

- How many substitutes a good has?
<br>
<i>Example:</i>Could you replace the benefit of food with something else?
<br>
No, because you need food to survive. Which means that when the price of food increases, you’re going to pay it anyway because there are basically no substitutes for food. 
<br>
This is different in the case of automobiles. There are more substitutes available instead of driving (public transportation, motorcycles, walking, bike, working at home). You don’t have to drive to survive.
<br>
More substitutes=more elastic
<br>
Fewer substitutes=more inelastic
<br>
- How expensive a good is?
<br>A percentage change in price makes a bigger impact when the starting point is high.
<br>
Higher price=more elastic
<br>
Lower price=more inelastic
<br>


Also time frame is relevant: in short-term demand might be inelastic, in longer-term elastic, as there is more time to adjust, change habits and look for substitutes. E.g. if price of gasoline goes up, one still needs to buy it to go to work. However, in longer/term one might thing about buying a car with lower gas consumption, look for a job closer to home etc.


Taste/preference is also important: beer vs wine.  Both Beer and wine are for lesiure.  But we get some satisfaction from beer at a really good price vs wine.  So while we can substitute wine for beer, it is significantly cheaper and more appropriate for social occasions (in US at least).  Therefore, there would need to be a very large change in price of beer for people to switch to wine (and see it as substitute)
