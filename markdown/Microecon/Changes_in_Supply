## Notes for Week 2: 5.3. A Change in Supply


What if there is an increase in the price of gasoline (an input cost):

Demand stays the same. 
But the supply curve would shift left 
* it is now more expensive to produce each quantity of tomato.
* It is more expensive to transport each quantity of tomato to the market. Some may not afford
As a result, the market price of tomatoes would increase and the market quantity of tomatoes would decrease.
<br>•	Supply of tomatoes will change(a shortage) and Price of Tomatoes rise. Supply curve shifts to the left.
<br>•	Fewer tomatoes are produced (5 instead of 6) and those produced have higher prices (7 instead of 6)

Holding everything else constant, if tomatoes go through a bad freeze, the market price of tomatoes would increase and the market quantity of tomatoes would decrease.
