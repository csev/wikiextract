##Notes for Week 3: 4.1. Total Surplus: The Graphical Argument for Free Markets


Total surplus: 

•	Society is made by buyers and sellers

•	Total surplus: it’s a measure of societal welfare (consumer surplus + producer surplus)

•	If there is a market in which a person wants to buy something for 20 dollars and the seller asks for 10 dollars, the market is not efficient in terms of welfare (there could be more surplus)

•	If the market is left on its own, this is what it would generate in terms of welfare

Let’s see what happens when we decide how much of a given good should be produced

Case 1: instead of 6, a dictator says 8 needs to be produced (x axis)

•	Extra cost (A + B) is higher than extra benefit(B only), therefore social would be worse off (a quantity bigger than Q0 gives more costs than benefits)

Case 2: instead of 6, a dictator says 4 needs to be produced (x axis)

•	Also a quantity smaller than Q0 makes society worse off in terms of social welfare because we end up losing the extra surplus we had earlier at equilibrium

Assuming the market for Monster Rally Albums is correctly represented by the Supply and Demand curves, increasing the market quantity beyond the Equilibrium quantity (Q1) would decrease Total Surplus in this market.  In other words, anything else such as Q2 or Q3 will decrease Total Surplus.
