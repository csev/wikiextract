## Notes for Week 2: 3.2. The Supply Equation, Schedule, and Curve

The formula of the Supply is $$[Q_{x_s}=f(P_x, Price_{Inputs}, Technology)]$$.

<br>$$Q_{x_s}$$=quantity of supply
<br>$$P_x$$=price of tomatoes
<br>$$Price_{Inputs}$$=costs of creating supply
<br>Technology=technology

To create the table will be easy to imagine as a farmer(supplier) of tomato. If the price will be up then we the farmer will be able to sell much more of tomato; the quantity of supply will increase in proportion.

In that way, the Supply Curve will be the right-up-line in the Px/Qx diagram.
The line shows that if the Px will be up(/down), then Qx will be up(/down) which tells the change of the price would turn into the change in the quantity of supply.

(simon yuan) Be alerted that the quiz question: the price of Apple/Banana changes, the demand/demand curve for wine change or not.... is really confusing...just try again to get the Banana...Banana or wine...wine...
