##Notes for Week 8: 5.4 Governmental Solutions

3 most used strategies = taxes, permits and standards

If a government knows that a water supply can only absorb 200 tons of waste per year before it comes over polluted then has different options:

Can set standards / regulation – e,g, if two companies operate then can say that both of them cannot produce more than 100 tons of waste each.
This is the most prevalent way of dealing with externalities (e.g. US Environmental Protection Agency). 
The problem with this kind of strategy is that it doesn’t change the incentive to pollute less (e.g. producing 50 tons of waste is the same for them as producing 99 tons). 

Therefore can also use a tax the goal of which is to change the incentives so that they can produce less.
The advantage of the tax is that it provides an incentive for companies to produce less than 100 tons, as they will save more if they produce less waste (lower than the optimal level of pollution). 

Another strategy, would be to give a permit to companies to produce 200 tons of waste and no more.
In this example, permits are given to each company (e.g. to produce 100 tons of waste) and then these companies can trade these permits leading to a situation in which, for example, one company produces 200 tons and pays another company to produce no waste (effectively buying their permit). 
In order for this to work, there needs to be some sort of way for companies to be able to trade their permits – difficult, e.g. with worldwide pollution where pollution in one country affects another country (as with climate change).
