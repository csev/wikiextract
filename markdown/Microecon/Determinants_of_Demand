## Notes for Week 2: 2.1. The Determinants of Demand
DEMAND

Determinants of Demand -- Tomato Example

Four Factors:

 1. Price of product <b>itself</b> as price increases can buy fewer 
 2. Price of <b>related</b> goods, 
    e.g, price bread as <i>complementary</i> good to be used for tomato sandwich (if price of bread goes up, we will      do less of tomato sandwiches and will need less tomatoes)
 or 
    price of <i>substitutes</i>, e.g., red bell pepper could be used in salad instead of tomato if cheaper
 3. One's <b>income</b> influences how many tomatoes you can buy
 4. One's <b>preferences/taste</b>.  One may like tomatoes or may not.

It could be argued that there are other factors that affect demand, which are as follows:
1. Accessibility of supply of particular good 
2. How much money one is willing to pay for the purchase of a particular group. But again, it can be argued that is largely influenced by demand and supply.

When price changes, the quantity demanded also changes. There is a movement along the same demand curve. The factors, or determinants which affect the demand for a particular product, other than the price of the product itself, are:
1. Income - A rise in the income of the consumer will result in a rise in demand. A fall in the income will result in a decrease in demand for normal goods.
2. Consumer Preferences - Favourable change leads to an increase in demand and unfavourable change leads to a decrease in demand.
3.Number of buyers: More the number of buyers, greater the demand for the product, and vice versa.
4. Price of related goods: This can be grouped into two categories-
a. Substitute goods - Goods which can replace each other. For example, if the price of tea increases, the demand for coffee will increase. Increase in the price of the item will lead to an increase in the demand for the substitute goods.
b.Complementary goods - Those goods which are used together. Price of the complement and demand for the other good are inversely related. For example, Ice cream and ice cream toppings are used together. If the price of ice cream increases, the demand for ice cream toppings will consequently decrease. - SHIVANI PALEKAR, Mumbai, India

Determinants of Demand : When price changes, quantity demanded will change. When factors other than price changes, demand curve will shift. These are the determinants of the demand curve. 

1. Income : Consider the demand for new homes. You want a new home and choose one you like. The price is $2,000,000. You don't buy. One reason is that your income is not large enough to be able to afford this amount. Therefore, income must be one of the factors that affect the demand for a given product.

*** Be careful about what kind of goods are we discussing? Normal or inferior goods?
(see 2.4 for more details) - Yenting Liu

2. Number of buyers : The more buyers lead to an increase in demand; fewer buyers lead to decrease.

3. Consumer preferences : Taking the home example, you are buying home because you like homes. This we call tastes or 
preferences. It involves the fact that there are certain psychological reasons for liking or disliking a particular good. The principle is : the more (less) we like a good or service, the greater (less) is our demand for it.

4. Price of related goods : 
   (a) Price of a complement : Return now to your decision to buy a new home. Assume that you are willing to pay the price
and have sufficient income. What other factors might enter into your decision? One factor might involve the method you will use to pay for this home --- borrowing money. The price of borrowing money is called the interest rate. The interest rate is one example of the price of a complement.

   (b) The price of a substitute goods : Substitutes are different goods that compete with the one under consideration. Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are substitutes as are American cars and Japanese cars. Therefore as the price of the substitute rises (falls), the demand for the product rises (falls).

5. Expectation of future : Taking the same example of home, people are buying not just one home but 2 or 3 or may be 4-5 houses. 
Why would one do this? and the answer is that the buyer expects the price to rise in the near future. These expectations affect our demand for many products. So if buyers expect the price to rise (fall), the demand rises (falls) today. -*- Shilpi Gupta

There are 5 determinants of demand, put in an acronym I like to use (TIMER):

Taste
Income
Market Size
Expectations
Related Goods Prices
