## Notes for Week 2: 2.4. A Change in Demand: Part 1
A change in demand refers to a shift along the demand schedule and a complete movement of the demand curve either to the left or to right. A shift to the right signifies an increase and a shift to the left signifies a decrease in demand. 

This example determines the effect of changes of factors of demand, using the two factors: substituted goods and complementary goods.

Using the example of tomatoes, assume that red bell peppers are a substitute good for tomatoes and every other factor stays the same.

When price of substitute (red bell peppers) decreased, demand in tomatoes decreased and demand curve shifts to the left. When price of substitute increased, demand for tomatoes increased and demand curve shifts to the right. These occur at every price on the demand schedule. 

In the example, bread is the complementary good (it goes along with the tomato in a tomato sandwich). When the price of a complementary good (bread) increases, the quantity demanded for tomatoes decreases.
