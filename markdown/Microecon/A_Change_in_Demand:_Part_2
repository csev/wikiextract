## Notes for Week 2: 2.5. A Change in Demand: Part 2

Effect of Income on demand:
An increase in income would result in an increase in demand, i.e. the demand curve is shifted right (since more disposable income means that one can consume more goods).  However, in the case of an inferior good (a good one consumes only because of limitations in one's income, i.e. - ramen noodles, public transportation), the relationship would be opposite.

Effect of Taste/Preferences on demand:
Taste/preferences could change depending on many factors (i.e. - a new study published showing health benefits of eating tomatoes).  Demand curve would change exactly as expected (increase in taste would result increase in demand).
