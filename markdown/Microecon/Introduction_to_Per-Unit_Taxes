##Notes for Week 4: 5.1 Introduction to Per-Unit Taxes

THREE MAIN INPUTS

1. Gas in Chicago: very expensive because of many taxes adding up

2. Who share most of the burden of the tax (consumer or producer)?

•	Example: girlfriend and boyfriend moving apart; she is more into the relationship than him (her demand is more inelastic); she will be doing all the flights 

•	The side of the market which is more inelastic (having more trouble to adjust to the change) will be the one paying the burden

3. What is the burden of the tax on the market?
