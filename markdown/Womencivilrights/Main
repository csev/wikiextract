Welcome to the *Women and the Civil Rights Movement* wiki page!

In previous Coursera courses, a lot of the same questions came up on the forum and at one point I decided to write a FAQ thread so that the questions did not have to be answered over and over again. Since I was sitting on the document anyway, I decided to adjust the course specific elements so that it would apply to this course.

Additionally, even though we have a specific sub-forum for References & Research, experience tells that the recommendations often get lost in the overwhelming amount of threads. Partially for this reason, Coursera also offers a [Course Wiki][8] where everyone in this course can post as well. (You do need to log in again with your Coursera account). I would recommend that if you have a reference, you also list it there so that people can access a single list instead of searching all through the fora. Additionally, tag a thread with the word 'references' and everyone will be able to find your thread again by searching for the tag 'references' (see Q4d).

##General##

**1a Where should I start?**

By reading through the [Course Logistics][1] and the [Syllabus][5] to get an overview of what is expected of you in this course. Once you've acquainted yourself with the course material you can start by watching the [Video Lectures][2], doing the [Readings][3], and posting on the [discussion forum][4]. Additionally, you can attempt the [Quizzes][6] and the [Peer-Assessed Essays][7] (once they become available that is - see the [syllabus][5]) Be careful here though: you can only attempt a quiz once.
The weekly Guide document is attached to the [Video Lectures][2]. Just click on the icons next to the relevant videos.

**1b How many people are taking this course?**

In the first [lecture][2] *1-1 How the Course is Organized* the number 12,000-13,000 people is mentioned. Only the instructors can see how many people are currently enrolled, so it's possible this number has gone up.

**1c How can I set my timezone correctly so that I can see all the deadlines in my own time?**

You go to [Settings][17] and change the timezone to your own.

**1d How long will I be able to access the material of this course?**

They'll stay up for the duration of the course

**1e Will this course be offered again in the future?**

[This is currently unknown.][20] The agreements for offering courses are between coursera and the university, and Coursera decides whether to offer a class again. So no definite answers yet.

**1f What kind of browser do I need?**

[Google Chrome (all versions); Firefox (version 12 or later); Safari (version 5 or later); Internet Explorer (version 9 or 10).][21]

##Assignments##

**2a Where can I find the assignments?**

The writing assignments can be found [here][7] and the quizzes can be found [here][6]

**Peer-Assessed Essays** (FOR TIPS: See the [Guide to Writing & Evaluating Assignments][13])

**2b How do I submit my peer-assessed essay?**

You can start submitting the first assignment around March 7 and it is due around March 19 (depending on your [time zone][17]. See the [Syllabus][5] for all the deadlines.

- Step 1: You can submit your assignment by going to [Peer Assessment][7] and then 'go to assignment'. *Not possible? Get a blank page? Try a different browser. Mozilla, safari & chrome are all easily downloaded and installed. Check if you are using a correct version. See question 1f*

- Step 2: Enter your commentary in the box specified.*Make sure you are within the word limit (it won't allow essays that are above). Can't copy-paste from MS word? Try using the keyboard shortcuts ('ctrl c' for copying; 'ctrl v' for pasting.)*

- Step 3: Scroll down until you see the 'work cited' box and list your sources. *Didn't use any sources? Just write n/a in the box. Didn't literally quote them, but still used them? Make sure you list your sources then! Just write down a number in your essay where you used a source or took an idea from a source - even if it is just the lectures - and then in your work cited box list the numbers with the source information attached. [Remember that the assignment does require you to use citations and references!][9]*

- Step 4: Check the 'honor' code box. *You can find this both at the top and the bottom of the page. You need to click this and clicking it means you are entering YOUR OWN work - and not someone else's. (Therefore: make sure you use that work cited box to specify which sources you used to create your work, even if they are just the lectures or assigned readings.)*

- Step 5: Press SUBMIT. *Pressing 'save' doesn't submit and doesn't count as a submission. Don't worry if you spot an error immediately after you submitted. You can re-submit as many times as you like until the deadline. Once you have pressed submit, you get a button asking you to review your work. Clicking that leads you to a screen where you can see how your essay will look to your peer reviewers. Anything odd or not the way you want it? Go back. Change it. Press 'submit' and review again until you are satisfied! (Reviewing your own submission is optional but still advisable.)*

- Note: Did you get the Warning: *You are attempting to submit a Partially completed assignment. Are you sure?* The Coursera website gives that message when you haven't filled in all the boxes. Check your assignment and see if you've filled in all the boxes. Is one not relevant to you? Just write n/a. This should mark the assignment as 'complete' and allow you to submit without getting the warning.

**2c Will Dr Elsa Barkley Brown assess my assignment?**

No. The course is peer-assessed, so your assignment will be graded by your fellow students. Similarly, you will be an assessor for at least three students per peer-assessed assignment.

**2d How is my grade calculated?**

["The grade you receive is the median of all the peer grades. The reason for taking the median instead of the average of all peer grades is to reduce unreliable grades. Grades that are overly high or low will have a much smaller influence on the final median grade, as compared to the average of all grades."][11]

I.e. So: if 3 (out of 3) people graded you a 9 and only one gave you zero marks, that means that you still receive a 9. (Had it been the average grade, you would only have received a 6 

(The median is the grade exactly in the middle: in 1 3 5 8 12; this would be 5. In 5 7 9 12 12; this would mean 9. In the example given above: 0 9 9; this would be 9. Etc.)

In other words, even if one person genuinely graded you unfairly this still does not impact your grade. Coursera does this in all her courses for precisely this reason: so that a grade that is overly high or low has a much smaller impact on the final grade. The idea is that this therefore produces more reliable grades than if they should take the average.

**2e What if I don't want a grade for the course?**

You are more than welcome to audit the course. (Auditing a course means you listen to the video lectures, and perhaps complete the reading or post in the fora, but that you do not partake in the assignments.)

**2f Wordcount. Why does the Coursera website tell me I am over the word limit, but my word processor (MS Word; Open Office, take your pick) tell me I'm under the word limit?**

MS Word, Open Office, etc. and the Coursera website merely use different ways of counting words.

MS Word counts hyphenated words (seventeenth-century England; the best-before-date) as one word, but Coursera counts them as two (or three depending on how many you hyphenated...). MS Word doesn't always count abbreviations such as 'I've' or 'She's', 'Baker's' as two words, but the Coursera website does.

Just be aware of it.

**2g What if I don't agree about my grade & want it to be re-assessed?**

Sorry. That is not possible. Your only option here is to post your assignment on the forum so that you can invite more detailed feedback & hopefully improve next time. If you were genuinely graded unfairly then I sympatize but there is still no way to have your grade re-assessed.

---

**Quizzes**

**2h How many times can I attempt each quiz?**

Once. 

**2i But what if I started on a quiz, but can't finish it at that specific time?**

You SAVE the quiz. It only counts for credit once you SUBMIT the quiz (which you can only do once!)

**2j What about those late days? Do they start counting automatically once I'm late?**

["For the late days, these only are applied when you want to use them. So, for example, if you choose not to attempt quiz 1, you still have all of your 10 late days left when you begin quiz 2. If you complete quiz 2 three days after its due date, you have the option of applying some of your late days and you could choose to apply 3 or decide to apply only 1. Since there is a 5% penalty per late day, if you apply all 3 there would be no late penalty, if you applied 1 but were 3 days late, you penalty would then be 10% (2 x 5%)."][22]

**2k Do I have to do all the quizzes / essays to get a Statement of Accomplishment?**

No. As the [Course Logistics][1] specify, you have two ways to earn a statement of accomplishment. Either the quizes or the essays (you don't need to do both!)

First: through the quizzes. There are 12 quizes - each worth 20 points. If you earn at least 112 points from your highest 8 quizes, you earn your statement of accomplishment. ["The highest eight will be the basis for overall grade; there is not a requirement that one attempt all 12."][22]

Second: through peer-assessed essays. There are four essays. You need to attempt all four (including submitting peer-assessment) and need to get an average score of 5.4 (out of 9).

If you manage to do both, you get a statement of accomplishment with distinction. (There is also a way to get a certificate with distinction through forum posts: you would need an average of three posts a week and at least 8 vote-ups on your posts.)

----------
##Starting Late##

**3a Can I still gain a certificate?**

BEFORE April 22 (check your timezone!): Yes. So long as you make sure you apply all your late days to quiz 7 and 6 and complete all the quizzes thereafter and gain a score of at least 112 in total.  You also need to do quiz 5 still (I think), but you won't receive credit for it (because your score comes from the highest EIGHT quizes and you need quiz 5 to make 8 quizzes). You can also participate in the peer assessed essays (3 & 4).

AFTER April 22 (again, check your timezone): No, as soon as the hard deadline for quiz 5 has expired, you can no longer gain the required score for a certificate.

**3b Why should I still do the course if I can no longer get a certificate?**

Because the value of the course is not determined by the certificate, but by what you can learn from it. We are all here to learn. Just by listening to the lectures, reading the material and attempting to put your own thoughts into words by writing an assignment or posting on the forum, you can benefit from taking this course - regardless of any certificates involved.

----------
##Forum##

**4a How do I subscribe to a thread?**

You can either subscribe when you post on the thread (the 'subscribe' option is automatically on when you respond), or you can choose 'subscribe' at the top right hand of the page.

**4b Can I receive (or stop receiving) e-mails when someone replies to one of my posts?**

[From the Coursera help pages:][10]

- If you only want to stop receiving a single discussion thread, you can unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe button at the top of the thread. 

- If you don’t want to to be auto-subscribed to a thread after you reply to it, uncheck the “Subscribe to this thread at the same time.” box that’s at the bottom of each reply (you have to do this for each thread). 

- If you don’t want any forum e-mails at all, go to [User Preferences][12], and under Email Preferences, select “No, I would NOT like to receive forum notifications for subscriptions.”

**4c How do I upvote or downvote a post?**

You click on the arrows at the bottom of each post. Up- and downvoting are an indication of how useful a post is. Additionally, by upvoting a post it will rank higher on the 'featured' threads entitled 'top threads'. This will ensure students are more likely to spot it.

*Note: I'm accessing Coursera on a tablet (ipad specifically) or mobile phone (iphone specifically) and the numbers don't change. Is that correct?* Yes. Unfortunately, if you are on an apple device, you cannot upvote or downvote a post. This is a technical issue at Coursera and likely won't be resolved anytime soon.

**4d How do I tag a thread?**

At the top of a thread, you can click 'Add a Tag'. By tagging all threads which contain references with the word 'references', for instance, you can then, weeks later, still find those posts again by searching for the tag 'references' which will show all the posts tagged as such. 

**4e Am I being graded on my forum activity?**

Yes and No. If you are attempting to gain a certificate with distinction through the forum then you need to post an average of 3 posts a week and at least 8 up-votes on your posts. 

(Note: there is a difference between a *post* - made by 'reply to thread' and a *comment* made by 'add a new comment').

Otherwise, no, it is not required, but still advisable. The answer to Q3b applies here as well.

##Studying tips / Essay Writing / Subtitles / Taking Notes##

**5a Is Wikipedia generally considered a good source?**

Although wikipedia can be used as a starting point, wikipedia is generally NOT considered an academic source because anyone can edit its contents.

Wikipedia itself acknowledges this:

['IMPORTANT NOTE: Most educators and professionals do not consider it appropriate to use tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as a sole source for any information—citing an encyclopedia as an important reference in footnotes or bibliographies may result in censure or a failing grade. Wikipedia articles should be used for background information, as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting point for further research.][16]

[As with any community-built reference, there is a possibility for error in wikipedia's content—please check your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information.'][16]

**5b Using subtitles**

It is easier to understand the content of the lectures, especially if you are struggling with English, if you activate the subtitles. You can turn on the subtitles by clicking on the "CC" button in the bottom-right of the video player.

**5c How to I participate in writing the subtitles?**

[The following webpage][23] explains in detail how to work on subtitles for Coursera courses. (It's part of the 'wiki' and requires you to log in with your coursera account again before you can view the page.) A reason for a lot of the errors is because the initial subtitles are done by a machine transcription program.

Once you've created an account, [here][24] are the videos for this course.

**5d Where can I find more information on how to write my assignments for this course?**

The page [Guide to Writing & Evaluating Writing Assignments][13] specifies what is expected of you.

**5e Notes**

There is a group of students [who take notes on this course collaborately][26] and there is a [Facebook Group][25]. Both are completely student-led.
