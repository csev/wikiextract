## Lecture Notes

### Week 1

#### Introduction

* [[Crypto:Course Overview|Course overview]]
* [[Crypto:What is cryptography|What is cryptography?]]
* [[Crypto:History of cryptography|History of cryptography]]
* [[Crypto:Discrete probability crash course|Discrete probability (crash course, 2 parts)]]

#### Stream Ciphers

* [[Crypto:Information theoretic security and the one time pad|Information theoretic security and the one time pad]]
* [[Crypto:Stream ciphers and pseudo random generators|Stream ciphers and pseudo random generators]]
* [[Crypto:Attacks on stream ciphers and the one time pad|Attacks on stream ciphers and the one time pad]]

## Week 2

    Block ciphers and pseudorandom functions.
    Chosen plaintext security and modes of operation.
    The DES and AES block ciphers.

* Errata for "The Data Encryption Standard" approx. 6 minutes into the lecture:
  The formula for the Feistel Network $$R_i$$ is missing $$-1$$; the formula
  should read $$R_i = f_i(R_{i-1}) \oplus L_{i-1}$$.

## Week 3

    Message integrity. CBC-MAC, HMAC, PMAC, and CW-MAC.
    Collision resistant hashing.

## Week 4

    Authenticated encryption. CCM, GCM, TLS, and IPsec.
    Key derivation functions.
    Odds and ends: deterministic encryption, non-expanding encryption,
    and format preserving encryption.

## Week 5

    Basic key exchange: Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and Merkle puzzles.
    A crash course in computational number theory.
    Number theoretic hardness assumptions.

## Week 6

    Public key encryption.
    Trapdoor permutations and RSA.
    The ElGamal system and variants.

## Sandbox

Thought I'd add a [[Sandbox]], and use it to share notes and elucidate course experience
