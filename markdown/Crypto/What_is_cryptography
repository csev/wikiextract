* Secret key establishment
* Secure communication

#### Cryptography can do more

* [Digital signatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures)
* Anonymous communication [Mix Net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_net)
* Anonymous [digital cash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cash)
* Pseudonymous [digital cash](http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

#### Protocols

* Elections
* Private auctions

Anything that can be done with a trusted authority can also be done without. Instead of talking to the central authority the parties (voters) talk to each other using a protocol in a way that at the end the protocol reveals the outcome of the election without revealing the individual inputs

#### Crypto Magic

* Privately outsourcing computation [Verifiable computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing)
* [Zero knowledge proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)

#### A rigorous science

The three steps in cryptography:
*Precisely define threat model
*Propose a construction
*Prove that breaking construction under threat model will solve an underlying hard problem

#### Thm

Thm means theorem.
