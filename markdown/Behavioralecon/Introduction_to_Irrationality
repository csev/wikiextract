# Illusions

- We are better at vision than anything else since evolution has dedicated a huge part of our brain to it. 
- We don't actually see with our eyes but instead we see with our brains and it fills in patterns that it expects to see. 
  - for example, we expect to see things in context with it's surroundings (a man in a bear costume at a Halloween party may look quite different than one in the forest!)
  - the same color placed next to different surrounding colors makes it look like two different colors to us.
- Interestingly, we immediately repeat these errors even if we know they exist.
- Visual illusions are a great metaphor for decision illusions
- Healthcare, financial, and food choice decisions, for example, are newer in our evolution and odds are that they have even more potential for errors than we are aware of. 

# Defaults, or the power of the status quo

- A lot of times we take the path of least resistance, and take the default choice
- This is particularly true if we are faced with too many choices (decision paralysis)
- Opt-in and opt-out can thus have a drastic influence
- Interestingly, we will never admit that we just took the default option and rationalize our behavior
- We create stories to justify and explain our actions
- Defaults are neither good or bad, they are just everywhere
- The more alternatives, the more complex the decision process becomes and we incline to choose the default option --> we are lost when we have too many alternatives: jam experiment.

# Preferences

- A lot of times we only 'think' we know what we want. 
- When we don’t know what we want, we use the environment as a guide to what we want.
- We enter a framework to compare alternatives, the framework is composed of choice-sets. The idea is that we inherently don't know what we want and we need to restrict the possibilities by creating a framework. 
- Asking to give 10 reasons (as opposed to 3) why X is bad is influencing us into thinking X is good, because we struggle to find those 10 reasons.
- Temporary mindset is a state when an individual is influenced by stimuli during a short period of time and the decisions taken during that temporary mind-set might differ if the decision-maker is in another mindset: the way questions are framed typically influences temporary mindsets.

# Relative judgments

- We make judgments not based on absolutes, but relatively to the anchors that are available
- A temporary change of mindset may affect imminent decisions. A 0-9, "how often do you floss per day" scale is more likely to make us book a dentist appointment if asked immediately (because we're on the low end of the scale) than a 0-9 "how often do you floss per month" scale.
- The decoy effect or asymmetric dominance: using a choice nobody will ever select can nonetheless affect the outcome
  - In a "Paris", "Rome" and "Paris minus coffee" trip options, the latter option makes the first option more desirable --> the decoy effect helps contrasting alternatives.
  - A $159 paper-only newspaper subscription makes a $159 web+paper subscription look good - at the expense of a $59 Web-only subscription
- The constant race for a relatively better position can threaten an entire ecosystem (e.g. sea lions who get so large they have heart problems)

# The long-lasting effect of decisions

- Self-herding model: we tend to follow our own past decisions
- We remember actions far better than our transient emotional states
- The exact same experience can be regarded as good or bad, depending on how it is presented, or framed ( e.g. Tom Sawyer paint-brushing his aunt's fence with gusto, 
presenting the tedious chore as a rare opportunity )
- The presence of a random number will influence our judgment of a price if we have no other anchor. This anchor will be used to make further pricing judgments.
- We want to appear consistent (commitment mechanism). Once an anchor is set, all the subsequent decisions are made in a consistent way.
- Once a product is introduced in a certain way, that becomes a permanent point of reference. The way to get past that is to introduce a product in a different category (e.g. Starbucks coffee vs. Dunkin' Donuts coffee), this is called the anchor, it acts as reference point for pricing strategies.
- Relative comparisons of products in the same category remain fixed (cheap wine to expensive wine)and will scale (iphone reflects relative size to relative price of the ipad/bigIphone)
- We make comparisons within (not across) categories (we don't think "For the difference in price between these two bottles of wine, I can get four gallons of milk")
- Coherent Arbitrariness happens when a first 'arbitrary' decision is made (duckling choosing Lawrence as 'mama') then it becomes 'coherent' and imprinted (duckling continues to follow Lawrence confirming every subsequent decision)


# Learning from our mistakes

- We have many decision biases
- We don't have good intuitions
- We need to rely on empirical evidence to accurately measure to avoid mistakes
- Memento Mori, remember Cesar that in all your glory you are mortal.
- Doubt your intuitions. Experiment! Be humble.
- Break the procedure down into details and look for ways to improve it. 
- Just give it a try to see the results
