# Opportunity Cost (12:20)  

- Money's all about the opportunity cost.
  - This opportunity cost is something that is very hard for us to envision.
  - So instead we look at all kinds of shortcuts to make us feel that we're making the right decision.
  - We do all kinds of other things that are not perfectly rational, but at least makes us feel that we're making the right decision.
- The goodness of money
  - Money is an incredible invention. Money creates a central mechanism that everything could be traded of.
  - I think it's at the level of the wheel. It's such an important invention for society.
- Opportunity Cost
  - What you are giving up by choosing one thing over another.
  - Every time you're buying something, it's about what are you giving up, and what else could you do if you did not take this action.
  - People should consider the opportunity cost across time and across many categories.  But the fact is, it's incredibly hard to work this way. So, we don't.
    - People like to make a substitution in the same time frame in the same category.
    - We place a higher value on specific items than the monetary value of those items.
- Experiments
  - Purchasing a car
  - Purchasing stereo system
  - Willing to do something for a cup of cappuccino vs. $3
- Fool someone, or practical advice  :)
  - Take some money, make it specific, make it concrete, make it less valuable from economic perspective. But nevertheless, have a higher perceived value for it. And with that, change how people make decisions.

# Relativity (7:24)

- People tend to think about money in relative rather than absolute terms.
  - Experiment: $8 discount for a $15 pen vs. a $1000 camera --> people choose to walk a long distance to get the cheaper pen, but not for the camera. The psychological effect of 8$ is stronger for the pen.
  - Experiment: upgrade to leather seats for $2000 while buying a $40,000 car vs. $500 chair
  - Experiment: time taken for making decisions while renovating house vs. buying some tomato: snap decisions for large sums of money (renovation), vs carefully chosing the tomatoes --> small sums of money are more difficult to compare than large.
- Happiness
  - These decisions are not just about how we feel about spending money, they're also about happiness.
  - Are we willing to pay a premium for this increased happiness?  The answer is not so much.
  - Experiment: be a person who makes $90k a year in a company where everyone makes between 90k and 100k vs. be a person who makes $85k in a company where everyone makes between 60k and 85k  (A majority of this class chose the first one at the first day)
- Diminishing Returns (also called diminishing marginal return, or diminishing marginal utility)
  -  The first unit of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. (from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility))
  - We have this function in which our happiness starts very high, and then we have diminishing returns.
  - Another way to think about it is that we think in terms of percentages.
  - This is basically the way that relativity works, and how diminishing returns work. And why the same physical amount in terms of money has very different psychological implications.

# The Pain of Paying (14:32)

  - paying in cash is more painful than with credit card: instant payment and visual payment vs later and not connected to the instant.
  - pain of paying diminishes the pleasure of consumption: better to set up a payment system before or after the consumption act.
  - increase pain of paying: use cash, pay now and increase salience.
  - decrease pain of paying: use credit card, pay later.
  - pain of paying = guilt
  - AOL example with per hour payments, when switched to unlimited time vs payment, demand exploded instead of marginal increase as anticipated. Good example where rationality found its limits.



# Mental Accounting (8:09)
- we treat differently real money and goods worth the same amount.
- we associate money to categories, similar to a company assigning budgets to departments; the result is that we have difficulties mentally transferring money across categories, hence money is not fungible.
- this approach is not rational of course, however it is good strategy to break down a problem into smaller parts, making easier the decision making process.


# Fairness and Reciprocity (8:09)

- Note that the story about the mechanic charging $1 for banging on the engine and $99 for knowing where to bang is a fictionalized reframing of a true story involving [Charles Proteus Steinmetz](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2011/08/charles-proteus-steinmetz-the-wizard-of-schenectady/). (See the eighth paragraph at the preceding link.)
- the point of this story is to show we have difficulties rewarding expertise as we are not an expert ourselves and the time spent on a task is a good indicator of how much we should pay for something  - same example with the locksmith.
- because we use fairness relative to effort spent to complete a task, our willingness to pay changes: Coke example being charged more when hot temperature might have worked better if Coke would have indicated the higher price was meant to cover higher marginal costs.
- we associate fairness to marginal costs: ATM machine, NY Times. If no perceived marginal costs, we are not willing to pay more. Same example for beer: we recognise the same beer from a hotel or grocery store should be priced differently because we know hotels have higher costs running their premises.
- we use the concept of fairness to evaluate the amount of money we should pay for something.

# Loss Aversion and The Endowment Effect (12:17)
- we are more sensitive to losses than gains of the same amount -> loss aversion
- once we own something, basket ball ticket, mug, sofa, etc. we value more the object than a person who doesn't own the object and would be willing to pay for it: endowment effect.  In other words, people place a higher value on objects they own relative to objects they do not.

# Market and Social Norms (20:42)
- We live in a continuum between market norms and social norms. 
  - Social norms often dictate when money is an appropriate gift. In some situations adding money to the equation makes things worse (you suggest to pay your relatives after they hosted a family dinner).
- Gifts are in the social domain, so if you advertise the cost of your gift (show the price) - you violate social norms as money doesn't nourish your social relationship.
- Social relationships create a greater sense of reciprocity.
  - Gifts in the workplace move relationships toward the social domain and build social capital. Let’s say your boss sends you on a vacation to the beach -> this creates a less formal relationship between the two of you, so you will be more likely to be willing to do things like “work on the weekend”, etc.
- market norms and social norms are opposite. Social norms hide the value of money, the value of friendship is being evaluated but in a more fuzzy manner and it ought to be this way. If market norms are introduced in social norms, the effects are undesired: for example the Craigslist ad with the beautiful woman and the banker, same for the late penalty at school and it takes time to revert to social norms, it is like a breach of social contract.
- the letter of the law vs the spirit of the law, market norms abide to the letter of the law and social norms to the spirit of the law, enabling people to do more instead of having detailed obligations, as in a contract.  



# The Price of FREE (9:50)
- When a product or service is free, our view of its relative worth often becomes distorted, similar in a way to a calculator attempting to divide by zero.  Nominally the free item has no opportunity cost.
- Dan uses the example of 2 chocolates first priced at 1c and 25c to demonstrate value.  A 1c chocolate may normally be viewed as cheap, or inferior. When the price is reduced by 1c to demonstrate the logic of free, though the difference in price remains 24c, one chocolate is (magic word) free. 
- Dan provided an example of how to split a restaurant bill amongst friends.  He said that the worst way to split the bill is by price of items ordered from the menu.  It's better to split the bill evenly.  But, it's best for a single person to pay the entire bill.  This eliminates the pain of paying for one person and they get a free meal.  Also, the person paying gets a warm fuzzy feeling of giving.  
- At the end of the video lesson, Dan showed a graph that displayed pain of paying has diminishing returns as price increases.


# Micro-payments (11:42)
- Micro-payments break payment into small units and may reflect ease with which the internet allows us to pay for only what we want/consume, such as an individual track from an album, or an individual article from a news-provider rather than a magazine/newspaper.
- Micro-payments allow consumers to pay only for what they are going to consume.
- Micro-payments for many consumers increase the pain-of-paying as they now need to make a consumption decision per-item.
- Variability in pricing structure of micro-payments may lead to consumers adopting the path of least resistance, being the decision not to purchase, whereas uniformity in micro-payment pricing seems likely to lead to a simple buy/don't buy decision.
- Keeping prices equal simplifies the decision making process, making us more likely to buy.  For example, the Dollar Store.
- Having a free item compete against items requiring a micro-payment may result in the free-item cannibalising the market for paid-items.
