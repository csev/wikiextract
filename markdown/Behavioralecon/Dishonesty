# The Simple Model of Rational Crime (1447)  

- difference in perception between dishonesty acts and self-conscious for dishonesty.
- Wishful blindness: large amount of people turn a blind eye as they benefit from devious scheme (Enron)
- Is dishonesty a big act from a few individuals, or a little bit from many people.
- Math test experiment and shredder: lots of people cheat a little.
- Economic rational theory: cost / benefit analysis for car park (Gary Becker, Chicago Economist). Becker Theory: benefit, punishment, chance to get caught --> cheating is influenced by level of money, but experiment found that cheating was independent from $. Also the probability of being caught has little or no influence on cheating.
- Becker theory is probably not an appropriate model for predicting cheating.
- Based on the experiments, we can hypothesize that a lot of people did cheat a little bit at Enron.




# Shrinking and Expanding the Fudge Factor (2431)
- reducing the fudge factor = reduce the amount of tolerance people have toward themselves when cheating.
- Lots of people cheat a little bit.
- Morality training doesn't have a lasting effect.  For example, students from Princeton cheated just as much as those form MIT and Yale - even just two weeks after their crash course on morality. 
- However priming people prior to experiments reduced dramatically cheating occurrences - people didn't cheat after trying to recall the Ten commandments.
- If giving the moral reminder helps lower cheating, shouldn't the honor code declaration in the weekly quiz be done before attempting it?  Yes, the honor code at the beginning results in almost no cheating.  
- cheating is easier when money is not involved directly.  For instance, insurance companies report that lots of people cheat a little bit when reporting claims ( about 10 - 15% )
- Why do people cheat more or less when they see someone else cheating?  Social Proof.   For example, when the cheater was from a rival university, people cheated less.  When the cheater was from the same university, cheating increased.
- expanding the fudge factor: increasing the distance from money, get an example from someone cheating, witness the cheating behavior within your own social group, be creative.
- Fudge factor is about rationalizing cheating behaviour and still feeling good about themselves(indulging).
- What personality traits foster cheating behavior?  Creative people cheat more.

# Conflicts of Interest - "CoI" (1504) 

- when we believe something is good for us, we have a tendency to "force" it upon others, without acknowledging necessarily their own needs.
- CoI operate within the fudge factor.  Some examples are, we think about what's good for us financially, we don't notice it in ourselves.
- Our interest can blind us from seeing the interests of others


# Cheating Over Time and Across Cultures (1042) 

- What happens when we give people multiple chances to cheat over time?  People started by cheating just a little bit.  At some point, many people switched and started cheating all of the time.
- Why do people suddenly switch from cheating a little to cheating a lot? What the hell effect!  When they cannot feel good about themselves when cheating people say, "What the hell! Forget about it!" - Let me enjoy it as much as I can and cheat all of the way.
- What would it take to reset the fudge factor and get people to stop cheating?  When people wrote down their transgressions and asked for forgiveness, cheating decreased.  This provides people an opportunity to reset.  A big scale version of this is the reconciliation act in South Africa - people asked for forgiveness and started a new page.
- What about cultural differences? No cultural differences have been found.  Culture influences specific domains, but doesn't change the core of our morality.
- Do our experiments take into account cultural context?  Our experiments have no cultural context - they test a basic human capacity for moral flexibility 
- Culture can shrink or expand the fudge factor
- Which group cheated more in the beer study - Bankers or politicians?  Bankers cheated more by 2 to 1.  Caveat - junior politicians or congressional staff were used in the study.
