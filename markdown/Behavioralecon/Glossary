A list of terms to know for [[Behavioralecon:Main|A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior]].

#A

##Action control theory
Self-regulation theory suggesting that after choosing a course of action, people focus on how to effectively implement the chosen course of action and disregard or downplay alternatives.
##Adam-and-Eve problem
Would you sacrifice eternity in the garden of Eden for an apple? (No, but I would for knowledge of good and evil :-))
##[Adaptation](http://students.coba.unr.edu/econwiki/index.php?title=Adaptation)
 In economics, described as economic adaptation. When an agent must change their economic characteristics based on some type of shock. The shock, whether positive or negative will affect the spending habits of the agent
##[Affect heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic)
The positive and negative feelings that combine with reasoned analysis to guide our judgments, decisions, and actions; the sense (not necessarily conscious) that something is good or bad. A mental shortcut in which emotional response, or "affect" in psychological terms, plays a lead role. Reading the words "lung cancer" usually generates an affect of dread.
##[Affective forecasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting)
also known as 'hedonic forecasting' the prediction of one's affect (emotional state) in the future.  People are surprisingly poor judges of their future emotional states. For example, in predicting how events like winning the lottery might affect their happiness.
##[Altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism)
(selflessness) actions taken for the welfare of others. sacrificing something for someone other than the self(e.g. sacrificing time, energy or possessions) with no expectation of any compensation.
##[Altruistic cheating](http://students.coba.unr.edu/econwiki/index.php?title=Altruistic_cheating)
when individuals cheat to a higher degree because they realize that their actions can benefit people they like and care about
##[Anchoring (and adjustment)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring)
A cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.

##[Arousal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal)
Arousal is a physiological and psychological state of being awake or reactive to stimuli.
##[Asymmetric dominance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dominance_effect)
(The phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. A higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. Synonym: Decoy effect.
##Attention to standards
When people attend to their own moral standards (are mindful of them), any dishonest action is more likely to be reflected in their self-concept (they will update their self-concept as a consequence of their actions), which in turn will cause people to adhere to a stricter delineation of honest and dishonest behavior. However, when individuals are inattentive to their own moral standards (are mindless of them) their actions are not evaluated relative to their standards, their self-concept is less likely to be updated, and therefore their behavior is likely to diverge from their standards.
##[Attribute substitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution)
when an individual has to make a judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute.

Process taking place in the absence of effort, awareness, and intention and typically running to completion once initiated.
##[Availability heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)
"if you can think of it, it must be important." the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater we perceive these consequences to be.
#B

##BDM Procedure
Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (1964) procedure, asking participants to make a bid on their product between 0 and 100 cents (pretesting revealed that no participant bid more than $1.00). A random number is then drawn between 0 and 100; if participants' number is equal to or above that number, they pay that amount and take their creation home, if their bid is below the number, they don't buy it.
##[Behavioral economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics)
Behavioral economics and the related field, behavioral finance, study the effects of social, cognitive, and emotional factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions and the consequences for market prices, returns, and the resource allocation. The fields are primarily concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents.
##[Bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias)
Bias is an inclination of temperament or outlook to present or hold a partial perspective at the expense of (possibly equally valid) alternatives in reference to objects, people, or groups. Anything biased generally is one-sided and therefore lacks a neutral point of view

##[Bonuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-related_pay)
Money paid relating to how well one works. Synonym: Performance-related pay.
##[Bounded rationality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality)
The idea that in decision-making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision. It was proposed by Herbert A. Simon as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision making, as used in economics and related disciplines.
#C

##Categorization malleability
The availability of ways to categorize dishonest actions in more compatible terms and find rationalizations for them.

##[Cognitive bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)
Pattern of deviation in judgment whereby, inferences of other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion. An individual’s construction of social reality, not the objective input, may dictate one’s behaviour in the social world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
##[Cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)
The tension that results when there is a mismatch between our beliefs and our actions. We cannot change what we did but we can change what we believe, so that's what we do.

##[Coherent arbitrariness](http://behavecontheory.wikispaces.com/Coherent+Arbitrariness+-+Stable+Demand+Curves+Without+Stable+Preferences)
Preferences are initially malleable but become imprinted, i.e. precisely defined and largely invariant, after the individual has made an initial decision. Absolute valuation can be manipulated, but subjects do not change their preferences once established.
##Communal sharing relationship (CS)
Relationship earmarked by High levels of cooperation and ‘‘we-ness’’ (see Fiske's relational theory).

If the parties to an agreement could specify their respective rights and duties for every possible future state of the world, their contract would be complete. There would be no gaps in the terms of the contract. However, because it would be prohibitively expensive to write a complete contract, contracts in the real world are usually incomplete.  Default rules will fill the gap in a contract in the absence of an agreed upon provision.
##[Contrafreeloading](http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-words/contrafreeloading.aspx)
The behavior in which animals offered the choice between eating food provided to them for free or working to get that food would eat the most food from the source that required effort.

A systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project, decision or government policy. 
##Counteractive control
A variety of cognitive, affective, and motivational processes in order to counteract the influence of short-term costs and, thus, secure long-term outcomes when faced with a self-control dilemma in which short-term costs are in opposition to long-term outcomes (e.g. discomfort of medical checkup vs long-term health benefits).
##Counteractive control theory (CCT)
Valenced short-term outcomes may elicit more intense self-control efforts that, in turn, act to increase the likelihood of choosing according to long-term outcomes.
##Counterfactual thinking
The tendency people have to imagine alternatives to reality (what if...).
##[Creative dishonesty](http://students.coba.unr.edu/econwiki/index.php?title=Creative_Dishonesty)
The idea that being more creative, or being primed to be creative, can lead to more dishonest behavior. Creative individuals are thought to have the capabilities to find loopholes and then rationalize unethical behavior.
#D

##[Decoy effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_effect)
The phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others.

##[Disclosure (sunshine policies)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interestDisclosure)
Certain professionals are required either by rules related to their professional organization, or by statute, to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
##[Discount rate](http://painconsortium.nih.gov/symptomresearch/chapter_4/sec3/chas3pg1.htm)

##[Dishonesty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonesty)
##Disjunction effect
When peo­ple do not know with cer­tainty if an event A will occur or not, and if they have to make a deci­sion based on event A occur­ring, then they may post­pone their deci­sion until they know with cer­tainty if A has occurred, even if they would have made the same deci­sion whether or not A had occurred.

##Dread risk
A low-probability, high-consequence event, such as the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.
##Dual-process theories of thinking.
Theory that "people apprehend reality in two fundamentally different ways, one variously labeled intuitive, automatic, natural, nonverbal, narrative, and experiential, and the other analytical, deliberative, verbal, and rational” (Epstein). Stanovich and West (2000) labeled these two modes of thinking System 1 and System 2. One of the characteristics of System 1, the experiential or intuitive system, is its affective basis. Although analysis (System 2) is certainly important in many decision-making circumstances, reliance on affect and emotion is generally a quicker, easier, and more efficient way to navigate in a complex, uncertain and sometimes dangerous world.

The fact that people often demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.
##Equality matching relationship (EM)
EM relationships lie somewhere between CS and AR relation- ships—they are very structured but exhibit equality. In EM relationships, everybody receives the same rewards, and reci- procity is monitored to ensure that the scales never get too far out of balance (see Fiske's relational theory).
##[Expectation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_(epistemic))
What is considered the most likely to happen; a belief that is centered on the future.
##[Expected utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility)

##[Fixed cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_cost)
In economics, fixed expenses are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business.[1] They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced).
##[Fluency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_fluency)
Fluency is the ease of which something is processed. Ease of processing can exist in several forms depending on the modality in which processing occurs.

##Idiosyncratic fit
The fact that a given solution fits your very personal needs very well.
##[IKEA effect](http://danariely.com/tag/ikea-effect/)

Named after IKEA, the Swedish manufacturer whose products typically arrive with some assembly required.
##Impulsive purchasing
Behavior that is not regulated and that results from an unplanned spontaneous impulse. In particular, impulsive purchasing involves getting a sudden urge to buy something without advance intention or plan and then acting on that impulse without carefully or thoroughly considering whether the purchase is consistent with one’s long range goals, ideals, resolves, and plans.

##Injunctive norms
Norms specifying the particular behaviors that most people approve or disapprove of. To be distinguished from descriptive norms.
##Inside forecasts

The inside view is unrepentantly idiographic, anchored in a detailed understanding of the particular. 
##Intertemporal discounting
The tendency of people to discount rewards as they approach a temporal horizon in the future or the past (i.e., become so distant in time that they cease to be valuable or to have additive effects). To put it another way, it is a tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the "now".
##Intra-empathy gap
Our inability to make predictions about our future actions in an emotional state.
##[Irrationality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrationality)

##Libertarian paternalism
A philosophy that advocates designing institutions that help people make better decisions but do not impinge on their freedom to choose. Automatic enrollment is a good example of libertarian paternalism.
##Licensing effect
The subconscious phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security in one’s self-image or self-concept tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally. Synonym: self-licensing.
##Life cycle theory of saving
Households are assumed to want to smooth consumption over the life cycle and are expected to solve the relevant optimization problem in each period before deciding how much to consume and how much to save. Actual household behavior might differ from this optimal plan.
##[Limbic system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system)
A complex set of brain structures that lies on both sides of the thalamus, right under the cerebrum.  It appears to be primarily responsible for our emotional life, and has a great deal to do with the formation of memories.
##[Loss aversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)
People's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. First convincingly demonstrated by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

Telling lies to obtain sickness benefits.
##[Marginal cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost)
In economics and finance, marginal cost is the change in the total cost that arises when the quantity produced changes by one unit. That is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good.
##Market norms
Account for wages, prices, rents, cost benefits, and repayment being essential. Different from: social norms
##Market pricing relationship (MP)
Relationship involving ongoing cost-benefit analysis, and participants’ payments for their labor are based on a wage rate that reflects the amount and quality of the work performed (see Fiske's relational theory).
##[Mental accounting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_accounting)
We assign money to mental categories. This assignment determines how we feel about the money. We treat unassigned money differently.
##Mental dualism

##[Motivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation)
Motivation is a psychological feature that arouses an organism to act towards a desired goal and elicits, controls, and sustains certain goal directed behaviors. It can be considered a driving force; a psychological one that compels or reinforces an action toward a desired goal. For example, hunger is a motivation that elicits a desire to eat.
#N

##Narrow bracketing
A tendency to evaluate one project at a time, rather than an overall portfolio
##[Nomothetic approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomothetic_and_idiographic)
Approach based on what Kant described as a tendency to generalize. It describes the effort to derive laws that explain objective phenomena in general.
##Norm theory
Theory presented by Kahneman and Miller, postulating that norms are computed after the event has occurred rather than in advance. Specifically, they proposed that “each stimulus selectively recruits its own alternatives and is interpreted in a rich context of remembered and constructed representations of what it could have been, might have been, or should have been”.
##Norm-focus theory
According to norm-focus theory (Cialdini), the social context determines whether people attend to descriptive or injunctive norms at a particular time and how these norms will impinge on an individual’s immediate behavior.
##Normative theories
Characterize rational choice and are often derived by solving some kind of optimization prob- lem. The life cycle hypothesis is an example of a normative theory of saving since it is based on the solution to a lifetime consumption-smoothing problem.
##[Not-Invented-Here bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)

##Outside forecasts
Forecasts ignoring the details of the case at hand, and focusing on classificatory variables with demonstrable predictive power.
￼￼
#P

##Pain of paying
The agony of parting with our money. Dan Ariely says it has 3 components: (1) the opportunity cost, (2) a ‘hassle’ component, (3) a moral tax with its associated guilt. It is influenced by the method and the timing of paying.
##[Perception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception)

## Planning Fallacy
This is more or less what it sounds like; it’s our tendency to vastly underestimate the amount of time we’ll require to complete a task
##Pluralistic ignorance
A situation where a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but assume incorrectly that most others accept it, also described as 'no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes’, or ‘no one dares to say they don’t understand because they incorrectly assume that everyone else understands’. The effect is especially powerful in large groups.

The tendency to overpredict the degree to which one's future tastes will resemble one's current tastes
##[Prospect theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory)
Behavioral economic theory developed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, describing the way people chose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. The theory states that people make decisions based on the potential value of losses and gains rather than the final outcome, and that they evaluate these losses and gains using certain heuristics. The model is descriptive: it tries to model real-life choices, rather than optimal decisions.
##Psychophysical function
Function characterizing our diminished sensitivity to a wide range of perceptual and cognitive entities—brightness, loudness, heaviness, and money—as their underlying magnitudes increase.
##Psychophysical numbing
Diminished sensitivity to the value of life.
#Q

##[Qualia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)
The feeling of emotions; the internal and subjective component of sense perceptions, arising from stimulation of the senses by phenomena.
#R

##[Rational choice theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory)
A framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behavior. Rational choice theory uses a specific and narrower definition of "rationality" simply to mean that an individual acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage.
##[Rationality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality)
A rational decision is one that is not just reasoned, but is also optimal for achieving a goal or solving a problem. Rational choice theory uses a specific and narrower definition of "rationality" simply to mean that an individual acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage.
##[Rationalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(making_excuses))
An unconscious defense mechanism in which perceived controversial behaviors or feelings are logically justified and explained in a rational or logical manner in order to avoid any true explanation, and are made consciously tolerable – or even admirable and superior – by plausible means
##Readily available alternatives
Alternatives that the decision maker would have known about and could have chosen without investing much time or money.
##[Reciprocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology))
Responding to a positive action with another positive action, rewarding kind actions. As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal.
##Region beta-paradox
Intense hedonic states trigger psychological processes that are designed to attenuate them, and thus intense states may abate more quickly than mild states.. These errors of prediction are discussed as instances of a more general phenomenon known as the region-beta paradox
##Regret or dissonance reduction processes
Attempts to justify engagement in a costly course of action. The greater the costs associated with a course of action, the greater the need to justify engaging in it.
##[Regret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(emotion))
The comparison between where we are in life and where we could have been.
##[Relative accounting](http://students.coba.unr.edu/econwiki/index.php?title=Relative_Accounting)
Evaluating the difference in amounts or changes compared to a base amount instead of in absolute terms. Application: We are more likely to drive an extra five miles to save $5 on a $50 tank of gas than we are to save $10 on a $500 new computer.
##[Relativity link 3](http://students.coba.unr.edu/econwiki/index.php?title=Relative_Standing)
Evaluating where another individual stands relative to you and your social standing.
Application: We are more inclined to help individuals who are behind us in society. We are more likely to give donations to homeless individuals as opposed to giving to individuals who are ahead of us in social class, i.e. the wealthy.
##[Relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism)
The concept that points of view have no absolute truth or validity, having only relative, subjective value according to differences in perception and consideration.
##Remembered utility
The retrospective evaluation of previously experienced episodes.
##[Representativeness heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic)
Kahneman & Tversky's definition of representativeness: "the degree to which [an event] (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population, and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated". When people rely on representativeness to make judgements, they are likely to judge wrongly because the fact that something is more representative does not make it more likely. This heuristic is used because it is an easy computation. The problem is that people overestimate its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of an event. Thus it can result in neglect of relevant base rates and other cognitive biases.
##[Reward substitution](http://students.coba.unr.edu/econwiki/index.php?title=Reward_Substitution)
Using an alternate reward that is immediate and therefore more motivating. Reward substitution can get us to act like we care about the world while we really care about our image.
##[Risk aversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion)
The reluctance of a person to accept a bargain with an uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain, but possibly lower, expected payoff. 
##[Risk perception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_perception)
The subjective judgment that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk. 
#S

##[Salience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience)) 
A term widely used in the study of perception and cognition to refer to any aspect of a stimulus that, for any of many reasons, stands out from the rest.
##Saliency hypothesis
The saliency hypothesis suggests that when people observe someone behaving dishonestly (e.g., when they read about a new corruption scheme), the saliency of this act increases, making them pay attention to honesty and to their own standards of honesty, and, as a consequence, decreasing their tendency to engage in dishonest acts.
##[Satisficing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing)
A a decision-making strategy that attempts to meet an acceptability threshold. This is contrasted with optimal decision-making, an approach that specifically attempts to find the best option available. It explains the tendency to select the first option that meets a given need or select the option that seems to address most needs rather than the “optimal” solution.
##Save More Tomorrow (or SMarT)
Program to help people save more. The basic idea is to give workers the option of committing themselves now to increasing their savings rate later, each time they get a raise.
##Self-affirmation
By reflecting on their important values or past positive behaviors, people are reminded that they are moral and efficacious individuals, thereby affirming their self-worth. A cornerstone of self-affirmation theory is the idea that specific attacks on one’s abilities or morals – such as failure on a test – do not need to be dealt with directly, but rather can be addressed at a more general level by restoring or reaffirming a global sense of self-worth.
##Self-concept maintenance
People areoften torn between two competing motivations: gaining from cheating versus maintaining their positive self-concept as honest individuals. They typically solve this motivational dilemma adaptively by finding a balance or equilibrium between the two motivating forces, such that they derive some financial benefit from behaving dishonestly but still maintain their positive self-concept in terms of being honest individuals. 
##Self-control contract
See: Ulysses contract.
##[Self-control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control)
An umbrella construct that bridges concepts and measurements from different disciplines (e.g. impulsivity, conscientiousness, self-regulation, delay of gratification, inattention-hyperactivity, executive function, willpower, intertemporal choice). "What you exercise when you try to change something about how you would otherwise think, feel or behave in any given situation."  (Hedy Kober).  "The common thread run- ning through diverse conceptualizations of self-control is the idea of effortful regulation of the self by the self." (Angela Duckworth)
##Self-deception
According to Von Hippel and Trivers: an information-processing bias that gives priority to welcome over unwelcome information in a manner that reflect the individual's goals. Examples: biased information search strategies, biased interpretive processes, biased memory processes, rationalization and convincing the self that a lie is true.
##Self-herding
Behavior whereby we consult our memory rather than our preferences when faced with the question 'what would you like?'. We tend to stick to our habits: future decisions are influenced by previous decisions.
##Self-licensing
The subconscious phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security in one’s self-image or self-concept tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally. Synonym: licensing effect.
##Self-sufficiency
An insulated state wherein people put forth effort to attain personal goals and prefer to be separate from others. 
##Self-verification
Accurately gauging one's abilities (reality-oriented).
##Shadow value of money
What you are giving up by choosing one thing over another. Synonym: Opportunity cost.
##Simple model of rational crime
States that whether people commit a crime or not is determined by a cost benefit analysis. The potential benefits are the amount to be gained, the potential costs are the risk of getting caught and the punishment. There is no morality involved.
##[Sisyphus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus)
In Greek mythology Sisyphus was a king punished for chronic deceitfulness by being compelled to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, and to repeat this action forever.
##[SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory_(criminology))
States that whether people commit a crime or not is determined by a cost benefit analysis. The potential benefits are the amount to be gained, the potential costs are the risk of getting caught and the punishment. There is no morality involved.
##Social facilitation paradigm
The tendency for people to do better on tasks when in the presence of other people. This works only if we are good at the task. If the task is novel, performance will be worse.
##Social identity theory
Theory according to which group members tend to use their own group to maintain or enhance a positive social identity and self-esteem, and as a consequence are motivated to conform with norms that provide them with an in-group identity, rather than an out-group one.
##[Social norms vs. market norms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(social))
Social norms are group-held beliefs about how members should behave in a given context. Include friendly requests where instant payback is not required. Different from: market norms.
##Social proof
Proof that someone from your group, from your background behaves in the same way.
##Social proof (Cialdini)
People look to others to guide their own behavior, especially when uncertain (from Noah Goldstein's guest lecture).
##[Social psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology)
The scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.
##Spendthrift
Consumer who experience minimal pain of payment and, therefore, ends up spending more than what he himself would consider as normatively appropriate (definition of Rick, Cryder, and Loewenstein). Opposite: Tightwad
##[Status quo bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias)
Cognitive bias, irrational preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.
##Subadditivity effect
The judged likelihood of a whole set of events will often be less than the sum of the judged likelihood of its exclusive and exhaustive parts. The more detailed, specific, and psychologically compel- ling one makes scenarios, the less logically justified one is in retaining belief in the likelihood that those scenarios will occur.
##Sunk cost effect
The fact that people continue to devote resources to failing projects in which they have previously invested.
##Sunshine policy
Policy intended to achieve greater "transparency"  and thereby reduce nepotism, corruption, collusion, cronyism, conflicts of interest, etc. It comes for a famous quote by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, "Sunshine is the best disinfectant", meaning that transparency will prevent dishonesty and conflicts of interest.
##Suppression
Situation in which, in an effort to control nonverbal signs of nervousness that might reveal deceptive intent, people try to control their face, trunk, and limbs. One of the cues of deception.
##Symbolic self-completion
People are motivated to complete their self- definitions (e.g., musicians) when indicators or symbols of this definition are lacking (e.g., skills) by engaging in activities that complete the symbols (e.g., training). Thus, when moral self-definition is at stake, such as when one has indulged in morally questionable activities, one should naturally be motivated to engage in activities that will restore moral integrity.
#T

##Target-hardening
A crime reduction policy aimed at discouraging would-be offenders by making law-breaking require effortful planning (e.g. antitheft devices require more advance planning to steal a car).
##Tightwad
Consumer whose affective reaction to spending may lead her to spend less than her more deliberative selves would prefer (definition of Rick, Cryder, and Loewenstein). Opposite: Spendthrift.  In common usage, a tightwad is a slang term for a miser.
##Time-inconsistent preferences
Humans have a systematic tendency to switch towards "vices" (products or activities which are pleasant in the short term) from "virtues" (products or activities which are seen as valuable in the long term) as the moment of consumption approaches, even if this involves changing decisions made in advance. Consider having the choice between getting the day off work tomorrow or getting a day and a half off work one month from now. Suppose you would choose one day off tomorrow. Now suppose that you were asked to make that same choice ten years ago. That is, you were asked then whether you would prefer getting one day off in ten years or getting one and a half days off in ten years and one month. Suppose that then you would have taken the day and a half off. This would be a case of time inconsistency because your relative preferences for tomorrow versus one month from now would be different at two different points in time — namely now versus ten years ago. The decision made ten years ago indicates a preference for delayed gratification, but the decision made just before the fact indicates a preference for immediate pleasure.
##'Tom Sawyer's Law'
In order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.
##Toothbrush theory
We all need a toothbrush, we all want a toothbrush, but nobody wants to use anybody else’s toothbrush. We want to create our own ideas and theories, but we don’t want to rely on the ideas of others.
##[Transaction cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost)
A cost incurred in making an economic exchange (restated: the cost of participating in a market.
##[Trolley problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)
A thought experiment in ethics, first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967. The general form of the problem is this: Person A can take an action which would benefit many people, but in doing so, person B would be unfairly harmed. Under what circumstances would it be morally just for Person A to violate Person B's rights in order to benefit the group?
##[Two-system theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory)
Provides an account of how a phenomenon can occur in two different ways, or as a result of two different processes. Often, the two processes consist of an implicit (automatic), unconscious process and an explicit (controlled), conscious process. 
#U

##Ultimatum bargaining game
A game in which a proposer offers a division of a commodity (e.g., chips to be converted to money), and a responder can accept or reject the proposed division. If the responder accepts, the commodity is divided as proposed; if the responder rejects, neither party receives anything.
##[Ulysses (commitment) contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_contract)
Contract in which you know your future self will be tempted and you bind your current self to prevent your future self from misbehaving.
##[Utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility)
A representation of preferences over some set of goods and services.
#V

##Vice product
A product that is often bought impulsively, even though consumers consider the products to be unhealthy and experience regret after the purchase. Opposite: Virtue product.
##Visceral factor
A wide range of negative emotions (anger, fear), drive states (hunger, thirst, sexual desire) and feeling states (pain) that grab people's attention and motivate them to engage in specific behaviors. Unlike preferences they can change desire rapidly because they are affected by changing internal bodily states and external stimuli. Can be modeled as 'state-dependent preferences' motivating people to engage in specific behaviors through the combined application of carrots and sticks.
##Visceral regulator  

##[Visual illusions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_illusion)
Characterized by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. 
#W

##[What-the-Hell effect](http://danariely.com/2013/03/19/the-what-the-hell-effect/)
It’s the point where people switch from cheating just a bit to cheating a lot.

#X

#Y

##[Yerkes-Dodson Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law)
'Law' proposed by Yerkes and Dodson, which posits that there is an optimal level of arousal for executing tasks, and that departures from this level in either direction lead to a decrement in performance.
#Z
