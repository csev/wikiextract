Two states that control decisions - emotional and cognitive

#How do emotions work?
Emotions are executed automatically based on environment.  Emotions are more transient and short-lived than one might expect. Often the memory of action remains but the associated emotion fades away.  Emotions can overtake cognition

#Effect of arousal on:
a)sexual behaviour
b)willingness to take risks
c)willingness to act immorally

#What did we learn about the effect of arousal on our behavior?
Predictions about behavior in hot states are off the mark.  We become different people when aroused.

#Why do people who sign purity pledges have higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases?
They don't take a condom

#Intra-empathy gap: 
The difference between what you predict you’ll do in an emotional state and what you actually do.
We can empathise with people who are in a similar state. For example, people working out in a gym become thirsty can be more sensitive to water related causes at that time. And hungry people might be willing to donate more to charity for food-related issues.. 

#The Identifiable Victim Effect -
* A single victim inspires action whereas a (statistical) info about masses doesn’t.

* A reason why more money is given to small-scale causes (Katrina, 9/11) than large-scale causes (like TB, HIV, Malaria): one can identify with the former situations ("I could have been him"). Also, the latter group is more preventative which is more difficult.

* More money is given when the problem is identifiable alone than if it’s statistical. And if you introduce the statistical factor followed by the identifiable factor then the amount of money donated goes down (almost the same as original statistics).

* The Trolley Problem - discrepancy between cognitive and emotional thinking


* What happens when you think in computational terms?  It causes our empathy to decrease
* How do you get people to care? Take a big problem and break it up in a way to get people to act (using their emotions)
* What is the "upside of irrationality"?  Caring about others is a good thing.  If we only thought cognitiviely, than we would not care as much for others.
