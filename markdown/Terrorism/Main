#Edited and Expanded Transcripts

I took the transcripts from the Reading Section, and did some edits. Removed repetitions (“ at the phenomenon, the new phenomenon” to “at the new phenomenon”), joined the dis-jointed sentences (“for vigorous debates. Critical self-reflexivity and alternative” to “for vigorous debates, critical self-reflexivity and alternative”), corrected a few mistakes (“who was hijacked. Who was taken hostage by” to “who was taken hostage by”, “real dominated” to “male dominated”), replaced [foreign] with the actual foreign terms, added some pictures / screenshots, added video quiz questions. This is far from perfect.

(Earlier, i gave the individual links. But when i update the files, the URL changes. It's cumbersome to keep changing URLs and also to keep adding this page)
