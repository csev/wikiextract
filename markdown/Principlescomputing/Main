This class covers a collection of principles that are fundamental to Computer Science. As a motivating application of these principles, we will examine a collection of strategy games and apply these principles in the analysis/solution of these games.

Each week, you will watch a set of 6-8 videos and then complete homework on the mathematical aspects of these concepts. Your main weekly task is to complete a mini-project that furthers your practical understanding of the material. Both assignments have a soft deadline of Monday and a hard deadline of Thursday. An optional collection of practice activities is also available to further reinforce the concepts introduced in the videos.

Below is a tentative syllabus for the class. Please note that the topics and mini-projects listed below are subject to change.
