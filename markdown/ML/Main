Welcome to the ML wiki page!

If you've recently solved a tough installation issue or gotten helpful advice about a review question, programming exercise, or the video lectures, please take some time to help out your fellow classmates by writing about it in the appropriate wiki page.

Feel free to create pages as needed. To see how to edit or create a page, see "Help" on the left navbar.

## Course Information

This course is at an undergraduate level, likely situated in second or third year. The only major prerequisite is experience with at least one programming language. Octave and MATLAB are easily learned if you have programming experience. If not, plan to spend some extra time on the programming exercises. The course is not math-intensive, and all methods that use calculus are explained through use of "intuitions" for the non-expert.

## Lecture Notes

Different students have different learning styles, and having written notes to accompany the video lectures will be very useful to students who prefer learning by reading. Contributing to these notes will help those students, and will also help you internalize what you just learned!

This paragraph formerly had a link to a set of lecture videos and presentation slides, from the original version of this course. But Coursera deleted all of the old course materials on June 30, 2016. So the lecture slides are no longer available.

## Tips for Octave on OS X
### Try installing a later version of Octave than the one recommended on the course content (3.8.0). 
http://wiki.octave.org/Octave\_for\_MacOS\_X. Under "Installing a Mac OS X Bundle," you can click on "download Octave 4.0.3 with Graphical User Interface."
### Error message "unknown or ambiguous terminal type"
A) Try changing the terminal type with this command, for any of "qt", "x11", or "aqua":

    setenv("GNUTERM","qt")

Alternatively you can install the AquaTerm backend from SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/

and then reinstalling GNUplot with Aqua terminal support:

    brew uninstall gnuplot
    brew install gnuplot --with-aquaterm

B) You may also try this:

    brew uninstall fontconfig
    brew install fontconfig --universal
    brew uninstall gnuplot
    brew install gnuplot --with-qt

... then add this to ~/.octaverc

    setenv("GNUTERM","qt")

### The hist() or plot () function hangs
It's not really hung - on some distributions of Octave, the first plotting function you call causes the font library to generated. This can take a minute or so the first time, then after that the plotting functions will work much faster.

Alternatively if Octave still does not respond after some time, you may have to change your fontconfig. I also installed gnuplot with-x11 and changed the file octaverc. These are the terminal commands:

    brew install fltk
    brew install gnuplot --with-x11
    brew uninstall fontconfig
    brew install fontconfig --universal

    then edit /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc , put this in the file

  -------- (start copy) --------

    setenv ("GNUTERM", "X11")
    gnuplot_binary("/usr/local/bin/gnuplot")
    graphics_toolkit('gnuplot')

  -------- (end copy) --------

save the file and start octave

verify by running:

    available_graphics_toolkits        % this will show the available graphics toolkits that can be loaded
    loaded_graphics_toolkits           % this will show the graphics toolkit that is currently loaded

other useful command examples:
    
    register_graphics_toolkit("fltk")  % this will add the fltk graphics toolkit to the available graphics toolkits list
    graphics_toolkit("qt")             % this will load the qt graphics toolkit
        

### Errors when editing ex1 "plotData.m"

If you get an error like: 

    error: invalid character 'ï¿½' (ASCII 226) near line 14, column 14

Then try to uncheck the TextEdit Preference - Smart quotes and Smart dashes; then use double quotes(") instead of single quotes(')

### Try Using Vagrant and Virtualbox
If you are using OS X (and some brands of Linux), you can have a lot of trouble getting the visualizations to work natively. One solution is to turn to virtualization; you can find a vagrant file that gets an ubuntu machine configured in virtual box, along with scripts to make this feel like a native OS X app here: 
http://deepneural.blogspot.fr/p/welcome.html
Another script can be found here, but this one is just the Vagrant file and does not have all the nice OS X scripts bundled with it. 
https://gist.github.com/Starefossen/9353638

You'll additionally need virtualbox and vagrant to go down this route, which are thankfully both free. 
https://www.virtualbox.org
https://www.vagrantup.com

You'll need an X server, which you almost certainly are using in Linux already, but does not come out of the box with OS X.
OS X users can get it here: http://www.xquartz.org
