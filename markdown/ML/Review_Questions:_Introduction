Be careful clicking on the page when answering questions. I notice that if I select one answer, then later click on what appears to be whitespace on the page (to make sure I have focus off the buttons, for scrolling) - the answer next to that whitespace gets selected, even if your click-point is far away from the content of the question. So be careful when you click on whitespace, and don't accidentally select the wrong answer.

There is a question with more than one answer.

Answers to the questions requires analytical thinking. If you understood the lectures properly then it wont be an issue.
