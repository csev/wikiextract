Proposed erratum: the Optional exercise (Section 3.5) instructs you to select $$i$$ examples from the cross-validation set. Shouldn't you always validate on the full cross-validation set as in section 2.1?

Other miscellany:

- shouldn't it be "vs." instead of "v.s."?
- p. 3 "overal"
- p. 6 "wil"
- p. 7 "For use polynomial regression [sic]"
- p. 7 "zero-eth" - shouldn't this be "zero-th"?
- p. 9 "where the low training error is low [sic]"

### Debugging Tip
The submit script, for all the programming assignments, does not report the line number and location of the error when it crashes. The follow method can be used to make it do so which makes debugging easier.

Open ex5/lib/submitWithConfiguration.m and replace line:

     fprintf('!! Please try again later.\n');
(around 28) with:

    fprintf('Error from file: %s\nFunction: %s\nOn line: %d\n', e.stack(1,1).file,e.stack(1,1).name, e.stack(1,1).line );

That top line says '!! Please try again later' on crash, instead of that, the bottom line will give the location and line number of the error. This change can be applied to all the programming assignments.
