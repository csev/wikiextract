## Last question

I am confused with the answers I received for the last question! I believe there is only one correct answer, but the system told me there are three correct answers. Is this OK?

### Answer

The last question is as follows:  

Let A and B be 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following must necessarily hold true?  
Is this the question you are referring to?  
This has two correct answers.

When given space to type the answer, just enter the answer -- don't "show your work". (I did and the computer graded it wrong with the correct answer shown on other side of equal sign!)

There were two correct answers in the options I was given. If my memory holds good, one was A+B=B+A and the other one was (A*B)*A=A*(B*A)

## Writing matrices

I don't know how to write the answer to question 4. I tried to represent a 1x3 matrix by writing [10 20 -15] (not the actual numbers). The results came back as wrong, but it gave no explanation, so I don't know if my calculations or my syntax are inaccurate.

### Answer

I had this same issue at first.  Double-check the expected dimensions of your matrix multiplication.  Hint: if *A* is a matrix with dimensions *n*x*m* and *B* is a matrix with dimensions *m*x*p*, what will be the dimensions of the product *AB*?

Please note that system also expects you to input a single real number instead of a 1x1 matrix. This is not correct (since number is not the same as a 1x1 matrix), but this is how checking works (as of November 4th, 2015).
