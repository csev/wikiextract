##Summary of Events

What started as a peaceful protest in Istanbul on 28 May, 2013 with fifty environmentalists protesting against the plans to replace the local Taksim Gezi Park with a shopping mall. They were met by extensive violence on behalf of the police, who attacked the protesters with tear gas and water cannons. This caused the protests to escalate to other Turkish cities, turning into protests against the actions of the police and the current government. Currently the protests are taking place in all around Turkey, and 1700 demonstrators are reported to have been arrested. The government has also ordered a media blackout on the protests, which has resulted in little information on these events being available around Turkey, often reporting false information and false numbers of those injured and dead. The Turkish prime minister Erdogan claimed that these events 'are created by those who couldn't win elections, supported by foreign forces.'
