> *The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - these are thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to the education and rank.* 
> -- William Zinsser in *On Writing Well*, 1976


Be vigilant and ruthless. After investing much effort to put words on a page, we often find it hard to part with them. Try the sentence without the extra words and see how it's better -- conveys the same idea with more power.

### Eliminate superfluous uses of "there are / there is" ###
when you're losing a lot of "to be" verbs: is, are, was, were, be, been, and am. A lot of times, there's a better verb there. Or maybe you don't need the verb at all.  
* There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys -> We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.
* There was a long line of bacteria on the plate -> Bacteria lined the plate.
* There are many physicists who like to write. -> Many physicists like to write.
* The data confirm that there is an association between... -> The data confirm an association between...



### Omit needless prepositions.###
For example, "that" and "on" are often superfluous

* The meeting happens on Monday - > The meeting happens Monday*
* They agreed that it was true -> They agreed it was true.
