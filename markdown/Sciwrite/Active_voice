##Why you should use **Active** voice##
   - It's the natural way and easier to read.
   - In passive voice, reader can't know who did it, who takes responsibility for the verb.
   - Using passive voice doesn't make your paper more objective.
   - Style guidelines for many journals actually explicitly will tell you to write in the active voice.
   - You should use active voice in most part: abstract, introduction, results, or your discussion...
   - However, you should use **passive voice** for **method sections**.
##Is it OK to use **I** and **We**##
   - It's OK, and you usually have to use it to make an Active voice sentence.
   - You have to admit the fact that you did the experiments, using passive voice doesn't make it more objective.
   - You're putting your name as an author, so you are taking public responsibility for its content.
##When to use **Passive** voice##
You should use passive voice in **method section**, because in that section:

   - What was done is more important than who did it.
   - Readers tend to skim the methods section for keyword rather than reading it as prose.
   - You have to start many sentences using "We" or "I".
##Examples##
   - a recommendation was made by the DSMB committee that the study be halted.
     - => The DSMB committee recommended that the study be halted.
   - Major differences in reaction times of the two subjects was found.
     - => We observed the major differences in reaction times of the two subjects.
   - It was concluded by the editors that the data had been falsified by the authors.
     - => The editors concluded that the author had falsified the data.
   - The first visible light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA's Hubble space telescope.
     - => NASA's Hubble space telescope has taken the first visible light snapshot of a planet circling another star.
   - Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete, and an able bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are not different was rejected.
     - => Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete, and an able bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are comparable.

## What indicates **active** versus **passive** voice? ##

Words or phrases such as: was, has been, and believed; indicate a past experience for the reader.  When writing in **active** voice, remove negatives to positives by providing a present experience for the reader.

In cases where a past experience is necessary for the reader; for example, the sentence, "They did not believe the drug was harmful" use "They believe the drug is determined to be harmful. This is considered active voice indicating a past experience. 

Note, in the examples above, we have removed the negatives but added verbaige to the sentence for clarity and purpose.

To eliminate added verbaige such as "to be" which indicates **active** voice, use:
*They believe the drug is determined harmful.
