## Strong verbs ##
### Why to use strong verbs ###
  - Verbs makes sentence lively and draws the reader.
  - Verbs are the most important elements in sentence.
### How to do ##
  - Try to pick the right verb.
  - Sometime, you can eliminate adverb by using the right verb.
    - reports approximately => estimates.
    - estimates something in future => projects.
  - Try to reduce the number of "to be" verbs you're using. They're boring so, use them purposely and sparingly.
### Examples ###
  - Loud music came from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena moved as the hungry crowd got to its feet.
    - => Loud music **exploded** from speakers embedded in the walls and the entire arena **shook** as the hungry crowd **leaped** to it's feet.

### (Learning Measure: Exercise 2) ###

Strong verbs assert an action about an subject or object.  Let's look at a few samples of strong verbs. 

Note, when reviewing this information, simplicity is not always the answer.  The audience varies based on the environment in which you write as does the level of technical content.  

For example, documentation written for a medical practitioner versus a web document on "causes of cancer."  In most cases, the web document is written to target a global audience and the document written for a medical practioner is written for a specific audience.

Example:
<pre>
Stephaine presented her oral argument in the court room today.
</pre>

Verb:  presented

Example:
<pre>
The wide scope of practice and resultant requires breadth of knowledge
demand and frequent use of medical literature.
</pre>

Verb: requires, use

Example:
<pre>
The question can be formulated as follows: (1) among elderly males with acute 
STEMI about to undergo coronary revascularization, (2) does the addition of a 2b/3a 
inhibitor to standard therapy, (3) versus standard therapy alone, (4) reduce infarct size?</pre>

Verb: formulated, addition, undergo, reduce

## Verb to noun transformation ##
  - Don't kill verbs by turning them into nouns.
  - Try to say exactly who does what to whom!
### Examples ###
  - During DNA damage, **recognition** of protein one by protein two results in **recruitment** of protein three, and **repression** of cell proliferation genes.
    - => During DNA damage, protein one **recruits** protein two and protein three. Which together **repress** self proliferation genes.
### Common unnecessary nouns should be turn to verbs###
  - Obtain **estimates** of
  - Provides a methodological **emphasis**
  - Has seen an **expansion** of
  - Provide a **review** of 
  - Offer **confirmation** of
  - Make a **decision**
  - Shows a **peak**
  - Provide a **description** of
  - ...

Verb to nouns transformation occurs when there is an action without an object in a sentence.  

Example: Verb
<pre>
The addition of a 2b/3a inhibitor to standard therapy.
</pre>

Example: Noun
<pre>
Preform the arithmatic operation of addition.
</pre>

In reading the sentence below, provide the verb for the word "revascularization."

<pre>
The question can be formulated as follows: (1) among elderly males with acute 
STEMI about to undergo coronary revascularization, (2) does the addition of a 2b/3a 
inhibitor to standard therapy, (3) versus standard therapy alone, (4) reduce infarct size?</pre>

Answer key: revascularize

## Don't bury the main verb ##
  - Keep the subject and main verb (predicate) close together at the start of the sentence
  - Readers are waiting for the verb!
### Examples ###
  - One study of 930 adults with MS receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting
**found** that only two-thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS-related problem in the prior six months had done so.
  - One study **found** that, of 930 adults with MS who were receiving care in one of two managed care settings, or at a fee for service setting, only two-thirds of those needing to contact their neurologist had done so.
