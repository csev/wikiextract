##Paragraph-level tips##
  - Each paragraph should have only **one idea**.
  - Try to break up your manuscript, organize ideas and flow using paragraphs.
  - Relax reader with white space.
  - You should come up with conclusion before details and data.
  - Make your paragraph flow nicely:
     - logical flow of ideas
     - parallel sentence structures
     - *if necessary*, transition words. Don't overuse it.
  - Your reader remembers the first sentence and the last sentence best. Make the last sentence memorable. Emphasis at the end!
  - Logical flow of ideas:
     - Sequential in time (avoid the Memento approach!)
     - General -> specific (take-home message first!)
     - Logical arguments (if a then b; a, therefore b)
###Example###
Usually, when a defendant absconds, a bondsman hires a bounty hunter to find and arrest him within the grace period (which, in California, is six months). *If* that fails, the bondman tries to seize any collateral that the defendant put down to secure the bond, or sues the defendant’s “indemnitors,” who signed the bail application as guarantors. *But* Zabala hadn’t put down any collateral, and so far Green—one of the few bondsmen who always do their own bounty hunting—had found neither him nor his indemnitors. The grace period was nearly up. *Soon*, Green would have to pay the court thirty-one thousand dollars.

##Note on repetition##
When you find yourself reaching for the **thesaurus** to avoid using a word twice within the same sentence or even paragraph, ask:

1. Is the second instance of the word even **necessary**?
2. If the word is needed, is a synonym really better than **just repeating** the word? You should repeat keywords-e.g. names of comparison groups, variables, or instruments
##Acronyms##
* It’s OK to repeat words. Resist the temptation to abbreviate words simply because they recur frequently! (recall: miR instead of microRNA)
* Use only standard acryonyms/initialisms (e.g., RNA). Don’t make them up!
* If you must use acronyms, define them separately in the abstract, each table/figure, and the text. For long papers, redefine occasionally (as readers don’t typically read start to finish).
