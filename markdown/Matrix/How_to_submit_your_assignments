If you want to transmit the assignment you call the python script ''submit\_python\_lab.py'', you enter your email address used in Coursra and your submission password (not your coursera password, check [https://class.coursera.org/matrix-001/assignment/index here]):

<pre>
$ python3 submit_python_lab.py 
==
== Submitting Solutions 
==

Login email address: your_email@example.com
One-time password from the assignment page (NOT your own account's password): 7E!*FHa3Y   

...
</pre>

You can avoid entering your email and you passwÎ¿rd by calling:

<pre>
$ COURSERA_EMAIL=your_email@example.com COURSERA_PASS=7E!*FHa3Y python3 submit_python_lab.py
</pre>

In linux systems you can configure ~/.bashrc file and add the line:

<pre>
export COURSERA_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
</pre>

Use expect-dev for automatic script login
==
In linux you can use the utility ''expect'' in order to make automatic login to the submission script. In case you don't have installed the package ''expect-dev'' in debian based linux distribution you can install it by the following command:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install expect-dev
</pre>

Create the file '''submit''' in the same directory where there is ''submit\_python\_lab.py'' and the python laboratory files. Put your coursera email and submission password inside the script.

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/expect
spawn python3 [exec find . -name submit*.py -print]
expect "Login email address: "
send "YOUR_EMAIL\n"
expect "password): "
send "YOUR_PASSWORD\n"
interact
</pre>

Make the script file '''submit''' executable with the command:

<pre>
chmod +x submit
</pre>

Execute the file ./submit and the expect utility automatically will login for you!

Hacking submit\_python\_lab.py
==
You can also direct hack the python script ''submit\_python\_lab.py''. Find the login function '''def loginPrompt()''' and comment the lines as it is demonstrated (add your email and your submission password):

<pre>
def loginPrompt():
    """Prompt the user for login credentials. Returns a tuple (login, password)."""
    #if 'COURSERA_EMAIL' in os.environ:
    #    login = os.environ['COURSERA_EMAIL']
    #else:
    #    login = input('Login email address: ')

    #if 'COURSERA_PASS' in os.environ:
    #    password = os.environ['COURSERA_PASS']
    #else:
    #    password = input("One-time password from the assignment page (NOT your own account\'s password): ")
    #return login, password
    return str("your_email@example.com"), str("7E!*FHa3Y")
</pre>

If you do this hack the python script does not asks for a login name and password and directs you in the submission list.
