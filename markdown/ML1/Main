# Graphlab issues

### 'import graphlab' fails after graphlab upgrade

**Prerequisite**

> Executing 
> <pre>
> import graphlab
> </pre>

**Error text** 

> ImportError: dlopen(/Users/***/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/graphlab/cython/cy_unity.so,
> no suitable image found.  Did find:
> /Users/***/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/graphlab/cython/cy_unity.so: unknown file type, 
> first eight bytes: 0x7F 0x45 0x4C 0x46 0x02 0x01 0x01 0x00

**Solution** ([source](http://forum.turi.com/discussion/1319/error-when-importing-graphlab))

One of the most probable cause is outdated pip.

To fix it start Dato Launcher, then select Terminal. Check current version of pip with
<pre>
pip -V
</pre>
In case you see older version just run upgrade with next command:

<pre>
pip install --upgrade pip
</pre>
Then re-install graphlab-create
<pre>
pip uninstall graphlab-create
pip install graphlab-create==2.0
</pre>

### SFrame.show() doesn't show anything
**Prerequisite**

> Executing something like
> <pre>
> import graphlab
> graphlab.canvas.set_target('ipynb')
> data = graphlab.SFrame('data/')
> data['image'].show()
> </pre>

**Issue** 

> Expecting some images to show up but it shows nothing

**Solution**

1. Make sure you are running correct graphlab version. Start Dato Launcher, then select Terminal. Execute next command:
<pre>
pip install graphlab-create==2.0
</pre>

**Workaround** (_if nothing else work_)

Replace 

> <pre>
> graphlab.canvas.set_target('ipynb')
> </pre>

with 

> <pre>
> graphlab.canvas.set_target('browser')
> </pre>

Instead of inlining images into the page it will open a new browser page for images. This is less convenient but this is something.
