2 Research Data Description
---------------------------

Starting from 2003, Beijing University (Beida = BEIjing DAxue) and Suzhou University (Suda = SUzhou DAxue) established a database on undergraduate students on the basis of their enrollment card (registration card). The joint databases from these universities comprise the data approximately 150,000 undergraduate students. The Beijing University database contains 64,510 student records, including the years 1952 – 1955, 1972 – 1987 as well as 1989 – 1999.  The Suzhou database contains 86,393 student registration entries from the years 1933 – 1965 and 1972 – 2003. The data analysis for this research only takes the years 1952 – 2002 into consideration.

With the support of these two universities we were able to gather the following information of 150,000 undergraduate students; parental (or caretaker) occupation, students’ previous educational institute, family residency, faculty research discipline, gender, ethnicity, to carry out sorting and coding. These two schools together cover several hundred research disciplines, 8,000 different names of parents’ (or caretakers’) profession and 50,000 unique previous enrolled schools. Because of the large number of unique family residency entries, only town and county will be distinguished for reasons of coding and programming benefits.

According to the students’ enrollment card data the number of recruited students of these two universities expanded over the period 1952 – 2002. Early enrollment card information may lack certain attributes but basically reflects the situation changes in volume of recruited student at these two universities. 
Data from Peking University in the years; 1952, after the merge, contains information from students transferred from other schools. The number of workers, peasants and PLA soldiers, admitted for higher education during the Cultural Revolution amounted to approximately 1,000 – 2,300 “students ” each year. In 1977, the GaoKao (university entrance exam) was reinstated, recruiting circa 1,000 students. Peking University admitted about 2,500 students a year during the 1990’s, except for 1989 and 1993, because of certain social events only 2,000 students were admitted. In 1999, universities nationwide expended enrollment, but the number of enrolled students for BeiDa was not significantly larger that year.

Suzhou University enlisted a couple hundred students each year before 1977. After 1977, this number went up to about admitting 2,000 students a year. Since the merging of Suzhou University, The College of Sericulture and Suzhou Institute of Silk Textile Technology in 1995, the number of recruited student distinctively started to increase from 1996. In 1999, when there was expanded enrollment and, in 2000, the merger with Suzhou Medical College, the number of recruited students surpassed 6,000 people a year. If the students from the merger are excluded, the actual increase of enrollment for Suzhou University is 1,000 people a year. 
Since the founding the PRC, there has been a small-scale increases of elite university entrance rates for the first 50 years, which is not in line with the tripled population growth.

Beida and Suda are respectively China’s and Jiangsu’s (province) elite universities. Beida has been one of China’s best literature and science comprehensive (?) university throughout the ages as well has been housing most of China’s best scoring  Gaokao students. Suda is a Jiangsu key provincial university and part of of the Chinese Ministry of Education’s Project 211 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211). 

1)	The years 1949 -1951, 1956-1965, 1970- 1971 at Beida lack student enrollment information.  
2)	For the years 1966 – 1972, Suda did not recruit any students and therefore does not have enrollment card information either. 
 
According to research by China’s biggest management science research institute on Mainland China’s university ranking, Suzhou was amongst the top 40, presenting year after year an increase. Before extending student enrollment numbers in 1999, there were nationwide 1,022 universities. Until 2006, after 7 years of putting the extended admission into practice, there were 1,867 universities nationwide, hence placing Suda in the top 4 % (?).

These two schools do not belong to the same category, the recruitment scope has obvious differences. Beida is subordinate to the Ministry of Education and the student recruitment is nationwide oriented, however the quota for provincial cities is by no means equal, for instance Beida outclasses the other. In all, there are over 64,500 Beida students from which it was possible for 57,628 students to determine their  place of origin. 155,561 come from Beijing and make up for more than 27%, second come students originating from Jiangsu province (5.3 %). Suda is Jiangsu’s provincial university and therefore having a low province student ratio. At Suda, most of the students (80.6 %) come from Jiangsu province, students originally coming from Sichuan come second (2.4 %). In 1982, Jiangsu Normal (Teachers) College changed it’s name to Suzhou University, 96.2 % coming from Jiangsu. Suda is rather a local university.

The minimum passing score for these two school is also different; there is a big gap between the students exam results. In 2003, the cut off point at Beida respectively was 590 points for liberal arts and 600 for sciences. That year, there were 760 people scoring more than 600 points at the sciences.
