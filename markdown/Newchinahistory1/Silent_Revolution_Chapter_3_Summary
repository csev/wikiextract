Chapter 3 The Silent Revolution of Parents' Occupation
======================================================

Occupation is a key measure to compare social class structure. The three main criteria to measure social class are: income, education, occupation.

For the purpose of this study, income and education are not used to analyze student's social class.
The reason is during the first 30 years of New China's establishment, income is too close to be useful to analyze the class difference. Income gap is widening in the last 30 years. However China lack a effective and reliable system to report personal and family income. Income is thus not a transparent measure to use. Neither is education level used in this study. Until the mid 1990s, parents of students from both university has low level of education. Few have higher education. The student record also did not collect data on parents' education level.

In contrast, the students' record provide rather complete information on the student's relatives' occupation. As occupation is the key attribute to reflect social class in China. As such we use occupation to define the students' social class origination.

Note that occupation has a specific context in China. In the first 40 years after the establishment of New China, most of graduate students' job are deployed by the state, which is very different from how people find their occupation in the West. Also occupation has a close relation with the work unit (单位), or place of employment. The work unit exert all encompassing influence the people and resource allocation. Due to the complexity we will not study the effect of the work unit. Instead occupation is considered to contain all the signal for owning and using social economic resources and a simplified measure of social class.

For the purpose of analysis, we adopted the national standard occupation classification as published in the "Occupation Classification Handbook".It encodes the occupation into these eight main categories:

1. Government, party, enterprise executives
2. Professionals
3. Staff (??)
4. Business services personnel
5. Agricultural workers
6. Manufacturing and transportation operators
7. Military personnel
8. Miscellaneous

The occupation handbook has further subcategories. For example, the category 1 above is divided into these subcategories:

1. China Communist Party's central and local executives
2. State organization executives
3. Democratic Party (??) and other non-governmental organizations' executives.
4. Social service organization (事业单位??) executives.
5. Enterprise executives.

Through this encoding, we have obtained statistics of parents' occupation from the two schools.
