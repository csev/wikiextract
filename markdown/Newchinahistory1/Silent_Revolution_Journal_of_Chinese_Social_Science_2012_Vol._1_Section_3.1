3.1 Trends in Urban and Rural Ratio - An Analysis of Residential Address
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Summary of this section:*

- Geographical locations of the country affects the economic development, cultural and social evolution as well as the educational development and standards of the counties.

- Home addresses are used in this study, instead of hometown (户籍）.  This takes into account of migration and the environment the students are growing up in.

- Out of the 145,312 registration cards, 127,378 have home address filled. This amounts to 87.7%.

- We divided the address into 3 categorizes - urban, village and town, and rural.

- Initially after the establishment of the New China, most students are from urban area.

- Peking University's non-urban student population has since increased from 2.4% to near 20%.

- Suzhou University's proportion of rural students are event higher than Peking University. In recent time, there are more non-urban students than urban students.

- There are some swings in the historical data, e.g. in 50s and 70s, mainly due to policies in place during cultural revolution.

To sum up, the relationship between geographic location and elite education are diverse. The proportion of rural students has maintained at certain level. Even as the rural population is decreasing, it does not have significant impact on the proportion of rural students.
