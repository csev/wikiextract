1 Introduction
--------------

Prior to 1949, students from well-off families, i.e. the upper and the middle classes, made up a dominant proportion of the student body in elite universities. It was almost impossible to find any students coming from families belonging to a lower segment of society, like the working class or the "farming" class.  Since 1949, we observed that more and more students from the working classes enrolled in elite universities - making up an increasing proportion.  We even noticed that students from the working classes made up a significant proportion in elite universities at provincial levels. This "Silent Revolution" is more than just a revolution in the field of education, it represents a major societal shift in China. Using the empirical data from two elite universities at the national and provincial levels, this paper shows that students from the working classes have benefited tremendously since "New China," making up a higher proportion of the student populations. The proportions remain stable despite the economic reforms, and even with a widening income gap in Chinese society.

Prior to 1949, the Chinese were given promises of equal opportunities for education. However, in actual fact, only a very small proportion were able to make it into elite education.  For example, during the Ming/ Qing Dynasties, the vacancies in the imperial education system were available to a very small proportion of the total population. Preparation for the imperial examination required prolonged periods of study, and that in itself was a major stumbling block to many families, except, of course, for the elite families who had the resources to pursue education at length. Today, academics view social mobility during the Ming/Qing Dynasties as having been limited. Imperial examination was almost an impossible dream.  Things have not changed substantially after the Qing Dynasty, when students from those families with sufficient resources, i.e. power or wealth, were able to enrol themselves into elite universities. From 1928 - 1949, there was a cumulative total of 185,000 graduates, which made up only 0.0007% of the total adult population in China (using the 1949 population as a base). This is lower than the proportion of Juren during the Qing Dynasty. Good and quality education was not wide-spread, and the costs of education was high.  As such, many youth were not given the opportunity to attend university due, not only to their level of education, but also for economic reasons.  A researcher involved in a 1929 survey on 182 undergraduates from elite universities could not help but comment, "How could families from the working classes be able to afford the education for their children?" Apart from these observations, there were a number of research studies done, all showing that education became "elitist" and exclusive during the Republic era.

After the revolution in 1949, there was a fundamental change in society toward an emphasis on education.  First, education in general was propagated: prior to 1949, only 3% of teenagers were given a high-school education in preparation for University enrolment, but after 50 years of development, by the beginning of 21st century, more than 50% are now high-school educated.  Graduates now make up 15% of the total population compared to 0.1% before 1949.  The talent pool has obviously deepened, and this focus on increasing access to education, in the opinion of some, truly embraces the Confucian value of "Education without Borders."

Next, the standardization of entrance examinations lowered the cost of university application and enrolment.  In addition, high school students no longer had to leave their home provinces to participate in the national examination, making testing more convenient.  High school education is free, or the costs kept low, and in some cases, the school provides subsidies to needy students.  As such, these measures enabled students from the working classes to pursue post-secondary education.

Finally, the policy implemented at the beginning of the "New China" movement required universities to preferentially enrol students from the working classes.  This accelerated the inclusion and increased the amount of variety in the student body of elite universities.

The main objective of this paper is to examine the effects of the education policies implemented since 1949 as well as their implications for society.  Society, as well as educators in general, are concerned with the openness and fairness of elite education in China. Developed countries in the West periodically make public the enrolment data of universities, for example, the University of California, however this is not the case in China, and due to a lack of complete data, we might not have the complete picture here. The lack of public information about university enrolment presents difficulties for this research field.
