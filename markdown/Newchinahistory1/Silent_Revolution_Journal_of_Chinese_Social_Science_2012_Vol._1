Silent Revolution: Social Origins of Peking and Suzhou University Students, 1952-2002
=====================================================================================

Abstract
--------

Since 1949, a revolution has happened in China's higher education system. The origins of students in elite higher education institutions has started to diversify, and the past monopoly by children from the upper social class has broken down. Children of workers and farmers from the lower social classes have progressively taken more seats in elite institutions and have maintained their weighted proportion in the student body until the end of the 20th century. Promotion of basic education, standardization of national higher education entrance examinations, and the establishment of a distinguished school system have all fostered the silent revolution. Although this revolution is not as breathtaking as a social and political revolution, its impact is just as profound. This research uses data from the student registration record from Peking and Suzhou University from 1952 to 2002 in order to demonstrate the revolution and its achievements, and to provide a reference for the reform and development of China's higher education.

Keywords: Silent Revolution, elite education, social origin, Peking University, Suzhou University
