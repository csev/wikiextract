3.2 Family Background and Education Opportunity - An Analysis of Parents' Occupation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we investigate how parent's occupation affect the chance for the children to receive elite education. According to the standard in the "National Occupation Classification Handbook" 《国家职业大典》, we assign the parents' occupation from the 150,000 student registration record into eight categories: 1. Government, party, and enterprise cadre; 2. Professionals; 3.Staff (??); 4. Business services personnel; 5. Agricultural workers; 6. Manufacturing and transportation personnel; 7. Military; 8. Miscellaneous. Because of the different in the design of the two school's registration card, Suzhou university student usually only has one parent's occupation, mostly of the father's. Peking university student, however, usually fill in both parents' occupation. Therefore, the statistics of Peking University's parent in this article is base on either parents' occupation.

The statistics shows from 1952 to 1999, 26.2% of Peking University student have at least one cadre parent, 37.46% have professional parent, 19.97% have farmer parent, 18.05% have worker parent, 6.38% have staff parent, 4.8% has parent as business service personnel. In Suzhou University, between 1952 to 2002, 26.43% of student have cadre parent , 16.77% have professional parent, together to a total of 42.20%. 5.06% of student's parent are staff, 3.90% of student's parent are business services personnel, 25.37% of parents are farmers, 16.77% of parents are workers. Workers and farmers together are 42.14%. The biggest different between Peking University and Suzhou University is in the ratio of professionals (26.2% to 16.77%) and farmers ratio (15.01% to 25.37%). Below (figure 2, figure 3) shows the annual distribution of parent's occupation from the two universities and explains major changes.

Firstly, after 1949, **farmers'** children have grow rapidly in the elite universities. Suzhou university's data shows that the growth is sustained, peaking not during "Cultural Revolution" but before it. In 1952, the farmers' children has reached 8% in Peking University. In 1954' it jumped to 17%. The growth in Suzhou University is more obvious. In 1952' the farmer's children's ratio has approached 17%. In 1955 it has increased to 28%. The student registration records from 1956 to 1966 are missing from the archive of Peking University, so we do not know what has happened during this period. For Suzhou University, until it stopped accepting student in 1966, farmers' children's ratio has been growing rapidly. In 1964, close to 60% of students are from farmer family, an especially high proportion. The significant decline of farmer's children did not happen after the reinstatement of higher education entrance exam but during the "Cultural Revolution". In 1972, there are over 30% of farmers' children in Peking University. In 1973, this has declined to over 20%. Suzhou University has similar trend. From the high of 60% it fell to 20%. Liu Yin believe during the "Cultural Revolution", 70% of students are cadres' children or has political background. Zhou's (周雪光) research follows similar direction. This shows that that the discontinuation of the objective examination for the recommendation system do not reward workers and farmers. It did not function even within the radical social context during the "Cultural Revolution".

<br />


Suzhou University's data (figure 4) has also shown that, within farmer's family group, middle and poor farmers has grown, while rich farmer and landowners' children have slide from the core to a marginalized group. Before 1956, rich farmers' children are more than half of the farmers; children. From 1957 to 1958 during the development of "Great Leap Forward", rich farmer and landowners' children drop rapidly to less than 10%. Middle and poor farmer's children has jumped (46 in 1956, 22 in 1957, and 242 in 1958) to over half. In "Cultural Revolution"' this trend has strengthened. Rich farmer and landowner has essentially retreated from the elite universities. Upper middle and middle farmers' children's ratio have also declined. Lower middle and poor farmers' children have become the dominated group of the farmers.

After the reinstatement of higher education entrance exam, there are other changes in farmers' ratio. It has fallen in Peking University but remained stable in Suzhou University. Right after the reinstatement of higher education entrance exam, farmers, children ratio has bottomed out. For example, Suzhou University has only 13% of farmers' children in 1978, the lowest after 1949. It has since rebound. Peking University's farmers' ratio maintained about 15% to 20% in the 1980s. In the 1990s, it was basically maintained above 10%. In comparison, Suzhou University's farmer's children ratio is higher and more stable, remaining around 25%. In the 1990s, it has a slightly upward trend. After 1982, within father's occupation, farmer is second only to cadre in Suzhou University.

Secondly, **worker's** children's ratio show sustained growth in both school. After 1949, benefited from the university admission policy that tilted toward workers and farmers and also the from the spread of basic education, worker's children are increasing in both school. Its ratio has reached 10% in the middle 1950s. From then on, the ratio keep growing in Suzhou University, reaching 20% in 1958. During the "Cultural Revolution" and after the reinstatement of higher education entrance exam, after experienced two period of fluctuation(??), has grown steadily after 1989. They become the third most common occupation for the father. Although the two schools have some difference in the worker ratio, the trend is quite similar. The factor that affect the workers' children's ratio are similar in national level and in the Jiangsu region. This may due to after 1949, the cities and their residents fall under the management of state apparatus and have a lot of similarity. The difference among cities of region is less than among villages.

The two peak growth period were occurred during the "Cultural Revolution" and the turn of 20th century. During the "Cultural Revolution", it has practiced a recommendation system in favor of worker-farmer-military. Worker's children naturally became an important source of the university. In both universities, the worker's ratio has approached the peak around 1973. In Peking university, it was close to 30%. The worker's ratio has reduced since then. After the reinstatement of higher education entrance exam, like farmers' children, worker's ratio has fell substantially. Peking University's worker's children were falling and through the 1980s. While workers' children have increased at times in Suzhou University, overall the number is still down. Only until 1989 has the worker's children's ratio increase again. At the end of the 20th century, Peking University and Suzhou University's workers' children are both above 20%. This phenomenon should be related to the increasing number of workers since the 1990s. Shortly after the establishment of New China, workers only constitute 1/3 of the combine group of workers and farmers. But the number has become half in the 1990s. The decline of farmers' children and the growth of workers' children is partly because after the economic reform, many farmers have changed their occupation to workers. The number of working farmer has decline in proportion, while the workers proportion has increased. The growth of workers' children illustrates that China's elite education, at least until the beginning of 21th century, facilitates social mobility and realized the goal of "open door" to the middle and lower class in the society.

Thirdly, regarding the **cadres**, in 50 years, the definition and character of cadre has been changing. The education level of cadre has also increased. Figure 2 and figure 3 show that the ratio of cadres' children has been increasing in both school. From a low initial level, it has advanced to become the highest recently. In Peking University, cadres' children ratio has grown from 11% in 1952 to 22% in 1973. From 1974 to 1976, the ratio of cadre has dropped to 10%. From then on, it has grown steadily from over 20% in the 1980s to over 30% in the beginning of the 90s. In 1997, it has reached 39.76% to become the most common of father's occupation, overtaking the professionals'. In Suzhou University, cadres' children were under 8% before the "Cultural Revolution". It has jumped to over 20% in 1972. After the reinstatement of higher education entrance exam, cadres' ratio increased from 20% in 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s. Cadre has become the most common occupation of the fathers. After the economic reform, the increase in cadres' children is likely the result of the increase in all kind of enterprises. From a detailed analysis of cadre father's job description from Suzhou University, after the reinstatement of exam, it is mainly increase in enterprise cadres and executive's children rather than party and government cadres' children.

<br />

We should point out, there are difference in enterprise cadre and executive's children and party and government cadre's children. Figure 5 shows the father's occupation from Suzhou University student registration cards. Initially after the establishment of the New China, enterprise cadres' ratio has declined rapidly, while party and government cadre and other cadre has kept increasing. The peak of party and government cadre ratio is during "Great Leap Forward" period rather the "Cultural Revolution" period. Since the "Cultural Revolution", the ratio of party and government cadre has declined steadily, while the enterprise cadre were increasing. They make up more than half after 2002. On the one hand, it maybe after the economic reform, many government cadre and professionals have transitioned to private sector, thus increased the ratio of enterprise cadre. The traditional "Mandarin", bureaucrat of government departments, are in steady decline. On the other hand, in Jiangsu, a more economically developed region, there emerged many village enterprises and joint venture enterprises. Therefore, the number of enterprise has greatly increased.  Therefore, the increase in proportion in cadres is more a reflection of economic development and social structural changes. It should not be simply interpreted as the administration's intervention of university enrollment.

Fourth - regarding **professionals**. Professionals' children ratio is high in Peking University historically. From 1952 to 1955, professional is the most common occupation for the father's. They are two to three times of cadres' children. But during the worker-farmer-military period in 1972 to 1976, professionals' ratio has dropped to the low of 6%. After the reinstatement of exam, professionals' ratio has rebound to 35% and was increasing afterward. It was around 50% in the 1980s, up to the record of 62% in 1989. But after the mid-1990s, the professionals' ratio has slided again. It is less than 40% in 1997 to 1999, slightly less than cadres' children. Professional's ratio is highest in Suzhou University in the 1950s. During the worker-farmer-military period in 1972 to 1976, professions' ratio has decreased. In 1978, the ratio has jumped from 18% to 32%. It stayed around 25% to 30% then. But from the 1990s, professionals' ratio is decreasing. It is even less than 10% after 1998. 

Since the 1990s, the professionals' children has decreased from both schools. In Peking University they are less than cadres'. In Suzhou University, they are not only less than cadres', the are even below workers and farmers. This is in contrast to the expectation that professional or intellectual families are more educated and more nurturing, and their children perform better in examinations. While we are do not have an exact explanation for this, it should be related to these factors. 1. Because of social development, many middle aged professionals have transitioned to leadership positions. They are categorized as cadre under our system. It is a likely cause for professional and cadre to switch place in Peking University. 2. Due to the economic climate in the 1990s, many professionals have since transitioned to become businessman in private sector. This is especially common in Jiangsu area. 3. Many professional who are in the 40-50 in the 1990s have not have higher education, therefore have limited positive influence on their children. Lastly, since the 1990s, it has become popular to children to study overseas. Due to their intellectual background and perspective, as well as stronger aspiration and capability, professionals send more children overseas and bypass the exam altogether. This results in their decline in number.

Fifth, **Business services personnel**. In 1952, even if their number are small, their children are 20% to 25% of Peking University and Suzhou University. At this time most business services personnel are capitalists and property class, a group that process a lot of economic resources. There after as many political activities have taken place, the capitalists class nearly vanished. Business services class is reduced to mainly services personnel with much less education and economic resources. Their children's ratio are also decreasing.

In general, in the 50 years, workers and farmer's children has maintained certain proportion and has not been significant impacted even after the economic reform. Worker's proportion has even increased in the 1990s. Consider that after the economic reform, large number of enterprises have emerged. Many farmers have leave behind the land to go to the factories. They are workers without a city residency. One can see a number of workers' children are former farmers' children. Therefore the decrease in farmers' children and the increase in workers' children is just another manifestation of this change. Student with a worker or farmer father has stayed about 30% to 40% in Peking University since 1981. In Suzhou University, there are only years when they are less than 39% since 1981. After 1994, they are over 45%. It even approach 50% after 1999, reaching 56% in 2002. As such, farmers' and workers' children are an important group in Peking university and the majority group in Suzhou university.

We utilize **Occupational Stratification Mobility Rate** (SMR) to further examine the change in parent's occupation in the two schools. This metric can more precisely reflect each occupation group's change in elite education system. Table 1 shows the changes in Occupation Stratification Mobility Rate since 1985.


<br />
**Table 1** Compare parent occupation composition with occupation distribution in population (1985-2002)
(See original article)
<br />

Cadres' children's Stratification Mobility Rate is far higher than other occupation in the two elite universities. From 1995 to 1999, cadres' children's SMR in Peking University is 23.04, meaning it is 23 times of the population ratio. Professionals' children's SMR is the second in both Peking University and Suzhou University. But, they are decreasing. For Peking University, this dropped from 9.04 to 6.88; for Suzhou University, it dropped from 4.43 to 1.59. In comparison, farmers' children's ratio is far lower than the ratio of farmer in the population, in the nation and in Jiangsu. Peking University's farmer's SMR has decreased, but it has increased in Suzhou University. Workers' children's ration has increased rapidly in Peking University, breaking above 20%. Workers' children's SMR has also increased from 1.04 to 1.31. Suzhou University's workers' children's SMR has also increased. Because of the large increase in workers' children's SMR, the ratio of workers and farmers combined has increased slightly in Peking University, and it has increased substantially in Suzhou University.

Research has shown that in modern society, education is the most important factor for individual to obtain social status and upward mobility. In 50 years, the social education community agree and stress that parent's occupation has decisive influence on children's attainment of education and job. Foreman(?) has point out in his 1966 study of US schools that family's social economic status has the greatest effect on students' result. Research of Chinese academic has also find the same phenomenon. Education do not change social structure, it preserves and strengthens the existing social stratification.

Data from Peking University and Suzhou University has shown, however, Chinese parent's occupation has less influence on the children's education than in overseas. Base on the student registration card from the two schools, even as cadres, profession and business service personnel's children are the majority or near half of the student population, they are not the absolute majority as in overseas universities. Workers and farmer's children are over 30% in Peking University, and they are about 40% in Suzhou University. Compare to overseas, Chinese education system is more effective to reduce the influence of parents' occupation on the children. It provides the workers' and farmers' children more opportunity of education and social mobility.
