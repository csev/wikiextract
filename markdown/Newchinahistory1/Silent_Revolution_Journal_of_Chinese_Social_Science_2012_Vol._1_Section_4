4 Conclusions and Discussions
-----------------------------

Based on the complete and accurate student records from these two leading high schools, this paper argues, that since 1949, there has been a silent revolution in higher education in China. The student origin of elite higher education institutions has started to diversify, the past monopoly by the children from upper social class has broken down. Children of workers and farmers from the lower social class has taken progressively more places and has maintained the weight until the end of the 20th century.

From this silent revolution of the Chinese higher education system, the continuation and development of the Chinese communist party's "non-silent" political revolution on society can be seen, and to a certain extent it exemplifies and consolidates the results from the "non-silent" revolution. Although the silent revolution is gentle, it is powerful and far reaching. Elite education not only decides the fate of individual students, but it also decides, from local to central government, the formation and source of various social elites that make up the cadres and professional and technical personnel at all levels. A considerable proportion of leading cadres and intellectuals come from peasant families, not only were their intelligence and talent not buried by their poor and weak family background, instead, they were stimulated by the educational system and became an important force for promoting social progression in China. The impact of this education revolution on social structural change is unprecedented.

This important change within the Chinese elite education system, is not only a revolution of traditions, the reform of the higher education in China when compared with the US, is also successful. After World War II, the US tried hard to promote student diversity in elite education, but there is disparity in the results achieved when compared to China's silent revolution. For example, the most elite private universities in the US only began to admit female students in 1969, enrollment of minority students have long been limited, and most elite universities marginalized children of low-income families. This is especially true in the last 20 years. A survey shows that in most schools in the best 30 universities in the US, taking the proportion of students from families with a household income less than 50% of US households as an example, the numbers decreased from 20%-30% in 1983 to 10%-15% in 2003, halved in a very short period of 20 years. In 2004, only 3% of students in the 146 elite university in the nation come from the poorest 25% of US households, whereas students from households with income in the nation's top 25 percent accounted for 74%. More than 70% of students at Harvard University in 2004 came from families belonging to the nation's top 25% of households in terms of annual income; while families belonging to the lowest 25% of household income provided on 6.8% of students. In elite private universities in the United States in 2008, students from families of the lower 50% annual income households  accounted for only 12%, students from families with annual income of the top 2.5% in the US actually accounted for 1/3. This shows that children of families in the lower strata of society entering US's elite universities are decreasing. Therefore, current education reform in China should not attempt to replicate the American experience entirely, otherwise it will lead to higher education reform going down the wrong track.

The are many causes for China to achieve this result. Obviously, the government's effort in promoting universal basic education is an important driving force. Universal basic education is the prerequisite for improved access to higher education for workers' and peasants' family. On the other hand, other arguments are more controversial. An example is the higher education entrance exam, which we believe is beneficial to workers' and peasants' family. The traditional examination system favors populace who have less cultural capital. Workers' and peasants' children can compete by studying and training steadfastly. Therefore using examination result as an enrollment criteria bolster the lower middle class children. Since the policy that favor workers' and peasants' children are aborted after the "Cultural Revolution", if not for the criteria of examination result, rich family can gain even more places in the university because of their stronger background in art, language and literacy. Another factor is the distinguished secondary schools system. Unlike many academics who are critical of it, we believe the distinguished secondary schools are helpful for workers' and peasants' children to gain access to university. Due to the limitation of the data itself and the article length, we are not able to research this in depth. We hope this research will stimulate more discussions, because it is an issue with urgent and practical implication in China.

Since the start of 21th century, the inequality in China's higher education is going up. For example, an 2009 article in People's Daily has pointed out, the number of students from workers' and peasants' family has decreased significantly recently. This is an alarming trend. How do we preserve the achievement of the Silent Revolution is an important issue in contemporary high education.

The Silent Revolution can not completely resolve every problem of inequality. From the data of the two universities, we have still observed inequality in distribution of geography, parental occupation and social gender. Some argues that the Peking University's per-province quota system is too concentrated locally and result in unfair competition for other regions. For example, a number of province send only a few students per ten thousand to Peking University. Many provinces send only １‰ of high school graduates. But in Beijing, there are more than 1% of high school graduates entered Peking University. Only if the quota is base on population size can there be equality of geography. But even if the population size is used as a basis for enrollment, it does not address the difference in occupational stratification mobility rate. Peasants' occupational stratification mobility rate is the lowest in both schools. Even in Suzhou University, the ratio of students from peasants' family are still much lower than the ratio of peasant population. Simple increasing the quota for these province will likely see them taken by urban area, bolstering cadres and professionals without increasing the diversity of the university students.

We believe, in the short term, maintaining and enhancing distinguished secondary schools' diversity is the most effective and most practical mean to maintain and enhance diversity in elite university. In the long run, continuing to strengthen basic education, improving the education quality of regular primary and secondary schools are very important to increase the diversity of student source of universities. From the data of the two elite universities, we find that the students are mostly come from a small number of distinguished secondary schools. The diversity of these secondary schools essentially guarantee the diversity of the universities. As the policy makers are considering maintaining and improving the openness and diversity of universities, they should focus on promoting and improving the diversity of student source of distinguished secondary schools. Currently, many distinguished secondary schools, motivated by financial concerns, are charging considerable amount of sponsorship fee (赞助费和择校费??). This will no doubt has some impact on the diversity of universities.

We believe enhancing elite education do not necessary result in social stratification. Since Bruno and Duncan established the social status research model (*translator note: 布劳和邓肯开创地位获得研究模型 I don't know what this actually refers to*), the academics have customarily used the amount of resources a family process to explain the children's academic achievement, setting up the expectation that elite education are naturally dominated by advantaged families. Such view has neglected an important fact that for specific social institution and culture, it is possible to break the inter-generational transmission of culture and occupation. The Chinese institution has a distinguished feature that it partially cut off the inter-generational transmission of ascendancy, so that elite and revolution can co-exist, and that elite education can be applied to diverse pool of talent. The challenge at present is how to fortify and expand the achievement of the education revolution under the current social condition.
