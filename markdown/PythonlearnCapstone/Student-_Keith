In my project I will attempt to find a correlation between Trump’s discourse and the general US political climate. I am going to select a few of Donald Trump’s more prominent speeches and analyze them using the Python module nltk (Natural Language Took Kit). The speeches are transcripts posted on websites like the New York Times. I’m going to extract them by scraping through the website’s html using Beautifulsoup, then I’m going to store them in a MySQL database. I will analyze Trump’s discourse using nltk’s linguistic tools such as concordance, common_contexts. I will also use nltk to find a frequency of certain words that Trump uses. As I get more advanced, I will attempt to find Trump’s syntax, and I may also employ regular expressions. Having analyzed his discourse with nltk, I will attempt to crawl through twitter and find out how people are reacting to him. This will help me find the correlation between Trump’s discourse and the general political climate.
