2. DATA USA
==========
About : In 2014, Deloitte, Datawheel, and Cesar Hidalgo, Professor at the MIT Media Lab and Director of MacroConnections, came together to embark on an ambitious journey -- to understand and visualize the critical issues facing the United States in areas like jobs, skills and education across industry and geography. And, to use this knowledge to inform decision making among executives, policymakers and citizens.

3. Quandl
=======================
I have found [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) to be a good source of economic and financial data.  If you register (free!) you can create an account that will give you a "token" and then use their API scripts to pull data right from the website or use their Python module, "quandl".  This lets you get your dataset without having to do any copying and pasting or downloading of files.
