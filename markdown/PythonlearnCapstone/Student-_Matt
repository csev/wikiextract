As I engage with my kids watching anime I find an impressive landscape of content with niche followings and limited time to engage. We can't watch them all, and don't want to experiment randomly and waste time.  I would like to try to organize the landscape and figure out where the good stuff is we want to watch together, "good stuff" being defined narrowly by what we like but also by a wide range of interests and creativity crossing genres. 

Therefore a consumer would appear to need customized guidance.  A search reveals impressive statistics already in action, as in this example from [AnimeNewsNetwork_Ratings:](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php?/ "AnimeNewsNetwork") complete with rankings based on bayesian statistical estimates, or the ability to customize your own lists and contribute what you watch to the database as in  [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php/ "Top Anime") ordered overall using weighted ranked averages. I tend to find the answers list-driven and combined across genres, so items near the top may not be of interest and the most desirable buried between 100-250 in the rankings, for example.   

Because tastes are infinitely divisible, some exploratory analysis here is likely to produce some new insights if only for personal use. Perhaps also seeing how audiences across these categories link together or overlap or differences between multiple site's lists. And certainly some visualization is in order with charts, linkages or how audiences overlap across genre.
