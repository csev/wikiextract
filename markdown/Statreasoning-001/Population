#Definition

A **population** is the entire group of entities for which at least one characteristic shall be surveyed. 

#Contextualization

In most cases an investigation including all entities is not feasible. The investigation is then constrained to a [[Statreasoning-001:Sample|sample]] aiming to infer characteristics of the population from those characteristics determined for the sample.
