#Definition

A **sample** is a subset of the [[Statreasoning-001:Population|population]].

#Contextualization

If a characteristic of a population is of interest but a comprehensive investigation is not feasible, the investigation can be constrained to a sample. Characteristics determined for the sample are then applied to the [[Statreasoning-001:Population|population]]. How the features of a sample and its analysis affect the accuracy of this inference can be assessed by statistical reasoning.
