# Exercise 1   What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?  
  
a) Execute all of the computation and logic of the program  
b) Retrieve web pages over the Internet  
c) Store information for the long term - even beyond a power cycle  
d) Take input from the user  

**Answer:** (c).
  
# Exercise 2   What is a program?  

**Answer:** A program is a set of instructions that specifies a computation, or at its most basic a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something. Other terms that refer to the same thing include script, code and software.
  
# Exercise 3   What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?  

**Answer:** A compiler translates a file written in high-level (human-comprehensible) language into low-level (machine) language all at once at a very very fast rate, and stores it so it can be used later. An interpreter uses high-level language and interacts (translates from high-level to low-level and back again) with a programmer in real time (human time).
  
# Exercise 4   Which of the following contains "machine code"?  
a) The Python interpreter  
b) The keyboard  
c) Python source file  
d) A word processing document  

**Answer:** (a) because the Python interpreter must translate the high-level language to machine code.
  
# Exercise 5   What is wrong with the following code:  
    >>> primt 'Hello world!'    
       File "<stdin>", line 1  
        primt 'Hello world!'  
                       ^  
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax  
    >>>   

**Answer:** 'primt' should be 'print'
  
# Exercise 6   Where in the computer is a variable such as "X" stored after the following Python line finishes?  
x = 123  

a) Central processing unit  
b) Main Memory  
c) Secondary Memory  
d) Input Devices  
e) Output Devices  

**Answer:** (b), Main Memory or temporary memory. The value of the variable is not stored and not available for retrieval after the program quits.
  
# Exercise 7   What will the following program print out:  
    x = 43
    x = x + 1
    print x
  
a) 43  
b) 44  
c) x + 1  
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically  

**Answer:** (b).
  
# Exercise 8   Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:  
(1) Central processing unit  
(2) Main Memory  
(3) Secondary Memory  
(4) Input Device  
(5) Output Device  
  
For example, "What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit"?  

**Answer:**    
(1) The CPU is like the brain.  Based on sensory input, the human brain acts on conscious thought while a human is awake, similar to how a waiter or waitress waits on people and continually asks them if they need anything.<br>
(2) The main memory is like our waking consciousness - what we are thinking right now.  Someone copying data (e.g. written notes) from one place to another may store it briefly in his or her brainâ€™s short-term memory during the copy process as he or she looks away from the source to the place where she or he is copying the data.<br>
(3) The secondary memory is like our long-term memory.  A student stores information away in his or her long-term memory while studying material in order to recall it later for quizzes, even after sleeping.<br>
(4) Input devices are like our 5 senses.<br>
(5) Output devices are like our facial expressions, gestures, or speech.    
  
# Exercise 9   How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?

**Answer:** Correct the grammar and/or spelling in the source code so the program can understand the instruction.
