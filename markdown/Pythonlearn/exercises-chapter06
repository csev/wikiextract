**Exercise 5 is  a graded assignment. Please do not post solutions to this exercise, even after the deadline has passed.**

Exercise 6.1 - Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.

<pre>
#Using 'while' loop
fruit=raw_input('Enter a string: ')
index = len(fruit)
while index > 0:
    letter = fruit[index-1]
    print letter
    index = index - 1
</pre>

Alternate version using negative indices:

<pre>
fruit = raw_input('Enter the name of a fruit: ')
index = -1
while index >= -len(fruit):
    print fruit[index]
    index = index - 1
</pre>


by using slicing

<pre>
fruit = raw_input('Enter the name of a fruit: ')
for letter in fruit[::-1]: print(letter)
</pre>


Exercise 6.3 Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it
so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.

<pre>
def count(string, letter):
	x = 0
	for i in string:
		if i == letter:
			x += 1
	print "The letter "+letter+" appears " +str(x)+" times in the string: "+string
	
count("This is a test", "t")
</pre>

Alternate version that returns the count to the calling code:

<pre>
def count(string, letter_were_looking_for):
    result = 0
    for letter in string:
        if letter == letter_were_looking_for:
            result = result + 1
    return result
    
print count('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', 'l')
</pre>

or

<pre>
def count(string, letter):
    print("The letter \""+letter+"\" appears",(string.lower()).count(letter),"times in the string: \""+string+"\"")

count("This is a test", "s")
</pre>

Exercise 6.4 There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise. Read the documentation of this method at https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods and write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in 'banana'.

<pre>
word = 'banana'
word.count('a',0,)
</pre>
