**Exercises 4 & 5 are graded assignments. Please do not post solutions to these exercises, even after the deadline for them has passed.**

*Exercise 8.1* - Write a function called chop that takes a list and modiﬁes it, removing the ﬁrst and last elements, and returns None.
Then write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all but the ﬁrst and last elements.

<pre>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


def chop(x):
    #x = x[1:len(x)-1]    #this is not right as mentioned we need to modify, not create new list
    '''right code is below'''
    del x[0]
    del x[len(x)-1]


def middle(y):
    return y[1:len(y)-1]


print chop(numbers)
print middle(numbers)
</pre>

*Exercise 8.2* - Figure out which line of the above programis still not properly
guarded. See if you can construct a text ﬁle which causes the program to
fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly guarded and
test it to make sure it handles your new text ﬁle.

<pre>
#The program can fail if a line that start with 'From' is composed by less then 3 elements
#If for example we modify the first line of the file mailbox-short.txt like this: From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
#the program will throw a Traceback IndexError because after doing line.split()
# the resulting list will be ['From', 'stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za'] which as a length of only 2
#therefor making the print words[2] line to fail



fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
# print 'Debug:', words
    if len(words) == 0 or len(words) < 3 : continue        # Seems redundant. Should be simply: if len(words) < 3: continue , no?
    if words[0] != 'From' : continue
    print words[2]
</pre>

*Exercise 8.3* - Rewrite the guardian code in the above example without two
if statements. Instead use a compound logical expression using the and
logical operator with a single if statement.

<pre>
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0

for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) != 0 and words[0] == 'From':  # still throws exception when len(words) < 3.  Should be: if len(words) >= 3 and words[0] == 'From':
        print words[2]
</pre>




*Exercise 8.6* - Rewrite the program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and
prints out the maximum and minimum of the numbers at the end when the user
enters “done”. Write the program to store the numbers the user enters in a list
and use the max() and min() functions to compute the maximum and minimum
numbers after the loop completes.

<pre>
memory = list()


while True:
    number = raw_input('Enter a number:')
    if number == 'done' or number == '' : break
    memory.append(float(number))


print min(memory)
print max(memory)
</pre>
