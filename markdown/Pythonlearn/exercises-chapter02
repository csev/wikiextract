This page is intended as a place for students to work out solutions and answers to the exercises from the textbook. Please do not post answers to exercises that are actual graded assignments,. 
  
**Exercises 2 & 3 are graded assignments. Please do not post solutions to these exercises, even after the deadline for them has passed.**  
  
# Exercise 4   Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:  
    width = 17  
  
    height = 12.0  
  
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression). Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.   
  
    width/2  
  
**Ans**: 8, type: integer
  
    width/2.0  
  
**Ans**: 8.5, type: float
    
    height/3  
  
**Ans**: 4.0, type: float
    
    1 + 2 * 5  
  
**Ans**: 11, type: integer
    
  
# Exercise 5   Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit and print out the converted temperature.

**Solution 1**  
  
    inp = raw_input("Enter Celsius Temperature: ")  
  
    temp_cel = float(inp)  
  
    print "Temperature in Fahrenheit", (9.0 / 5) * temp_cel + 32
  

**Solution 2**
  
    inp = raw_input("Enter Celsius Temperature: ")
  
    cel = float(inp)
  
    fahr = cel * 1.80 + 32
  
    print fahr
  
**Solution 3**  
  
    ctemp = raw_input("Enter the Celsius temperature: ")
  
    ctempf = float(ctemp)
  
    fahren =ctempf * 9/5 + 32
  
    print 'Converted Tempeture is :' ,fahren , 'Fahrenheit'

**Solution 4**  
  
    print float(raw_input("What is the temp in Celsius to be converted to Fahrenheit? ")) * 9 / 5 + 32  

**Solution 5**

    #f=(9c/5)+ 32

    Celsius=raw_input('Enter the temperature in Celsius: ')

    C=float(Celsius)

    Fahrenheit=(9*C/5)+32
    
    F= Fahrenheit

    print 'The temperature in Fahrenheit is ',F,'F'
   
  
**Optimal Temperature Conversion Formula**  
The 9/5 is based on 180/100 which is the difference between freezing and boiling in Fahrenheit and Celsius respectively.  
To save couple of clock ticks a more efficient formula would be :  
  
    `1.8 * temp_cel + 32`

**Solutions 1 through 5 are good examples of programming, but all are incorrect if you enter a negative Celsius number (use Optimal Formula).**
