### Online chat

Here is an internet chat relay (irc), accessible [HERE](http://webchat.freenode.net/) ; join channel : **#pr4e**

You can also configure your favorite irc client with the following informations :  server= irc.freenode.net ; port= 6667 ; channel= #pr4e


It is **important** to note that this is a student initiative, hence **not** an **official** coursera feature. Only expect help from other students there.

### Using the Freenode web site to connect

If you haven't used IRC before, you don't need a client or browser extension. Freenode has a web client: [http://webchat.freenode.net/](http://webchat.freenode.net/)  
  
All you need is a (somewhat unique) username, and the channel (chat room) name: pr4e. Enter those (don't use "philalethe", enter your preferred name), fill out the captcha, and hit connect.

Then you'll see this:

Don't worry if you don't see any chat going on. It only shows what's been said since _you_ logged on.  
  
Circled in blue is the channel name. The tab next to it, "Status" is information from the server. Make sure \#pr4e is highlighted. If you don't see that tab, type /join pr4e into the text box. Users are to the right (highlighted in yellow). Text input is on the bottom.   
  
That's it. Come say hi!
