**Exercises 1 & 2 are graded assignments. Please do not post solutions to these exercises, even after the deadline for them has passed.**

Exercise 7.1 Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the
file (line by line) all in upper case. Executing the program will look as follows:
python shout.py


<h3>Exercise 7.3:</h3>
Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun,<br>
they add a harmless Easter Egg to their program (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Easter_egg_(media)).<br> Modify the program that prompts the user for the file
name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name
’na na boo boo’.<br> The program should behave normally for all other files which
exist and don’t exist.<br> Here is a sample execution of the program:
python egg.py<br>
Enter the file name: mbox.txt<br>
There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt<br>
python egg.py<br>
Enter the file name: missing.tyxt<br>
File cannot be opened: missing.tyxt<br>
python egg.py<br>
Enter the file name: na na boo boo<br>
NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!<br>
We are not encouraging you to put Easter Eggs in your programs - this is just an
exercise.<br>
<h4>Answer</h4>
	count = 0
	fname = raw_input("Enter the file name:")
	if fname == "na na boo boo":
		print "NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!"
		quit()
	try:
		fcontent = open(fname)
	except:
		print "File cannot be opened:", fname
		quit()
	for line in fcontent:
		count = count + 1
	print "There were %d subject lines in %s"%(count, fname)
that is all!
