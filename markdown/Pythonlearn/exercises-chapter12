# Problem with executing socket1.py

As asked in the Exercise of Chapter 12 I altered socket1.py which I downloaded here: http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/socket1.py
my version looks the following:
<pre>
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('www.pythonlearn.com', 80))
mysock.send('GET http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/intro-short.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n')
count = 0
while True:
    print count
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    print data
    if len(data) < 1:
        print len(data)
        count = count+1
        continue
    print data
    count = count+1
mysock.close()
</pre>

I added count and print count and a second print data for debbuging. My code looks like the code that was presented in the course videos...so I have no idea why it is'nt working in my case.

When I execute the program I only get 0 as an output and aftrerwards nothing happens anymore (I waited more than half an hour). I don't get any errors or tracebacks which means that the program gets stuck somwhere in the process of receiving data. I also tried to use <pre>data = mysock.recv(12) </pre> to check if the data stream is too long...nothing helped.
The code from the videos also don't work on my computer...
Any hints?

I'm working on a late 2009 mac book pro with OS X El Capitan.
