#R Notes

##Getting Help in R

R has extensive built-in help. Here is a summary of ways to access it.

    help("functionName")            # will display help on the named function
    ?functionName                   # same as above
    help.search("aString")          # search help system for entries containing "aString"
    ??aString                       # same as above
    help(package=base)              # get a list of all functions, datasets, etc in package base
    example("functionName)"         # display examples of the use of function functionName
    demo()                          # list all demos in loaded packages
    demo(Hershey)                   # run the Hershey demo
    RSiteSearch("topic")            # search for the string topic in online documentation
    apropos("foo", mode="function") # list all functions with foo in their name
    data()                          # list all available datasets
    args("functionName")            # will list the arguments accepted by function functionName
    help.start()                    # access to R manuals in a browser window.
    vignette()                      # list the names of all introductory articles available in PDF format
    vignette("name")                # display the name vignette in a PDF reader

## Installing a Package

The `library` command is used to load a local package into your current R workspace.  It can only load packages that are already downloaded to your machine.

If when running `library` you get an error saying that the package couldn't be found you need to run `install.packages`  eg. suppose you want to load the kernlab library which you haven't downloaded,  you need to enter the following commands:

    install.packages("kernlab") # quotes are required
    library( kernlab )   # load the package into the workspace.

NOTE: the `install.packages` command will display a list of sites ordered by country and ask you to select one to download the file from, pick a site that is close to you as this might speed things up.  If the download fails, first try the install.packages again but pick a different site.


##Listing Packages

To list the packages that are installed on your machine use `library()`, to see which libraries are loaded in your workspace use `search()`.

##Removing a Package

`rm(list=ls())` doesn't totally empty your workspace in that it doesn't remove packages from your workspace. if you need to remove a package use `detach( "package:packageName" )`, replacing `packageName` with the name of the directory you want to remove eg, `detach( "package:downloader" )`.

`detach()` will remove a package from your workspace but it does not uninstall the package from your machine, for that you need to use `remove.packages()`. So to totally remove the downloader package from your current workspace and from your machine package library you need to do:

    detach( "package:downloader" )
    remove.packages( "downloader" )

##library() vs require()

There are two functions to load a package into your current R workspace, `library()` and `require()`.  The difference between the two is that if the function can't find the package (because it's not yet installed)  `library()` will generate an error where as 'require()` will generate a warning and return FALSE. 

So with require you could try to be a bit fancy in your scripts in the way you load packages:
   
    repoSite <- "http://cran.us.r-project.org"
    needPackage <- "downloader"
    if( ! require( needPackage, character.only = TRUE )  ) {
        install.packages( needPackage, repos= repoSite )
        library( needPackage, character.only = TRUE )
    }

This will first attempt to load the package with require if this returns FALSE then an attempt is made to install the package, and then load it into the workspace.

NOTE: the `character.only=TRUE` is required else library/require will attempt to load a package with the same name as the variable,  i.e. `needPackage`, rather than the name in the character vector which the variable contains i.e.. `downloader`.




## Configure R on Windows to use --internet2

R out of the box will attempt to access the web directly. This causes problems when the machine being used makes use of a proxy server in its web browsers; such as when it is behind a corporate firewall. You won't be able to download files or install.packages.

To enable R to pick up the proxy server used by your browser you need to enable the internt2 option in R.

setInternet2(use = TRUE)  # this will have to be done each time your run R

Another option is to right click on the icon you use to launch R and select "Properties", this will display a dialog, select the Shortcut tab, then at the end of the entry in the "Target:" text entry box enter --internet2 NOTE: that is two dashes. Click Apply and then OK. From now on when you launch R it will use the same proxy as your browser.

## Downloading Files on Windows


 - make sure you have enabled the internet2 option.
 - when using download.file **don't** include the `method="curl"` option that is only for Linux/Mac users.
 - if your getting warnings starting with "Warning: unable to move temporary installation ". You likely have a problem where the firewall running on your PC is blocking the action. Try disabling the firewall, run the command again, then re-enable the firewall. 



**Examples**

- **.csv file**

        fileUrl = "https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/data/csv_hid/ss06hid.csv"
        fileCsv = "C:/YourPath/ss06hid.csv"
        
        download.file( fileUrl, fileCsv )

- **.xlsx file** Compressed files should be downloaded as binary "wb"

        fileUrl = "http://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/dz54-2aru/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
        fileXls = "C:/YourPath/camera.xlsx"
        
        download.file( fileUrl, fileXls,,,"wb" )

- **.pdf file**

        fileUrl = "http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/pums/DataDict/PUMSDataDict06.pdf"
        filePdf = "C:/YourPath/cegov.pdf"

        download.file( fileUrl, filePdf,,,"wb" )


##Downloading Files On Mac/Linux

 - in the download.file call make sure you do include the `method="curl"` option
 - Linux: install the Linux curl package: from a bash/shell window enter `sudo apt-get install curl`
 - Linux: It is worth to install the Linux R devtools library `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev`

**Examples**

- **.csv file**

        fileUrl = "https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/data/csv_hid/ss06hid.csv"
        fileCsv = "/home/YourPath/ss06hid.csv"
        
        download.file( fileUrl, fileCsv, "curl" )

- **.xlsx file** Compressed files should be downloaded as binary "wb"

        fileUrl = "http://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/dz54-2aru/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
        fileXls = "/home/YourPath/camera.xlsx"

        download.file( fileUrl, fileXls, "curl",,"wb" )

- **.pdf file**

        fileUrl = "http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/pums/DataDict/PUMSDataDict06.pdf"
        filePdf = "/home/YourPath/cegov.pdf"

        download.file( fileUrl, filePdf, "curl",,"wb" )

## Subsetting a Dataframe

In the examples we will use a dataset, `df`, with 3 columns (`nums`, `lets`, `moreLets`) which is constructed as follows:


    n <- rnorm(20)
    l <- letters[1:20]
    m <- letters[7:26]
    df <- data.frame( nums=n, lets=l, moreLets=m, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

The following examples won't use the convenience function `subset` which while useful for interactive work in the R console it's use in R program scripts is not considered good practice. Also in the following pay attention to the `,` a common error is to forget it's inclusion when it is required.

    df[ 1, ]     # returns the first row of df in a data.frame
    df[ 1:10, ]  # returns the first 10 rows of df in a data.frame
    df[ c(3,7,9), ]# returns rows 3, 7 and 9 in a data.frame
    df[ 1 ]      # returns the first column (nums) of df in a data.frame
    df[ 2:3 ]    # returns columns lets and morelets in a data.frame
    df[ c(1,3) ] # returns columns nums and morelets in a data.frame 
    df[ "nums" ] # returns column nums in a data.frame
    df[[ 1 ]]    # returns the first column (nums) as a vector
    df[[ "nums" ]] # as above
    df$nums      # as above
    df[ , 1]     # as above
    df[ , "nums" ] # as above
    df[ , 2:3 ]   # returns columns lets and moreLets as a data.frame
    df[ , c(1, 3) ] # returns columns nums and moreLets as a data.frame
    df[ , c("nums", "moreLets") ] # as above
    df[ df$nums > 0, ] # returns all rows where nums is greater than 0
    df[ df[1] > 0, ] # as above
    df[ df[[ 1 ]] > 0, ] # as above
    df[ df$nums > 0, 2:3] # returns columns lets, morelets were nums > 0
    df[ df$nums > 0, ][ 2:3 ] # as above

The conditional expressions used above (e.g. `nums > 0`) can be extended to include multiple conditions joined by `&` for AND and `|` for OR e.g.

    df[ nums > 0 | lets == "a", ]  

will return all rows where `nums` is greater than 0 OR `lets` equals "a"

All the above will in interactive mode print the results to the screen. If you need to save the subset for additional work you need to use the assignment operator e.g.,

    subDF <- df[nums > 0 | lets == "a",]

**Note on use of logical vector to choose rows**

Assume same dataframe, `df`, as above, then

    choose <- rep(FALSE, 20)
    choose[1] <- TRUE
    choose[4] <- TRUE
    choose
    df[ choose,  ]  # will  only return rows 1 and 4

Be careful that the choose vector is the same length as the number of rows as your data.frame. The following will return rows, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20. Essentially the choose vector gets repeated until it is long enough to match the number of rows in the dataframe. It won't just return rows 1 and 4 as you might expect.

    choose <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
    df[ choose, ]

##Markdown, R Markdown

Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax that can be converted to XHTML or other formats. *R Markdown* is an integration of Markdown with R which can be used to easily produce nicely formatted documentation that includes R code along with its output (including graphics), all packaged into a single HTML file. This is discussed in the video lecture, [Example Analysis Assignment](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/83). See also the Sweave section below on this page (apparently Sweave is even more capable but more complex to learn).

See the *Further References* below for more information, but for a very quick start:

+ Install [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download/)
+ Run RStudio
+ Install the knitr package: install.packages("knitr").
+ Select from the main menu "File -> New -> R Markdown". You'll get a window with a sample file.
+ Save the sample file as "test.Rmd"
+ Now you should see a button labeled "Knit HTML" on the menu bar. Click that button.
+ You should see a finished web page that includes the text, R commands, output, and graph.

+ [Jeromy Anglim's video and slides on producing reproducible analysis](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.ca/2012/07/video-knitr-rmarkdown-rstudio.html)

###Command line using
Install the knitr package: install.packages("knitr",'markdown').

    library(knitr) 
    library(markdown)  
    knit('test.rmd', 'test.md') # creates md file 
    markdownToHTML('test.md', 'test.html') # creates html file
    browseURL( paste0( 'file://', getwd(), "/", "test.html"))) # should display HTML file in browser.

#FAQ

Answers to common platform related questions and issues. Also see the [Coursera FAQ](http://help.coursera.org/)

## Late Days

A large number of discussion forum posts have indicated that late days are broken. Not all are due to user error. A likely cause is that when deadlines were extended late days that had already been used unnecessarily were not refunded. Result was that student had less than the 5 late days supposed to be available. This could either be a Coursera platform issue or course staff failing to update late days correctly when adusting deadlines. Ultimately a platform issue since should be done automatically without staff intervention as a result of the deadline adjustment. Anyway it was NOT fixed by the end of the course. Hopefully will be noticed by staff in this FAQ.


## Fix Problems with video play back

See this [entry](http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/912521-why-do-my-lecture-videos-play-incorrectly-) in the Coursera FAQ.


## How to Watch Course Videos (and YouTube) at 2x Speed

[VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) is a free video player with excellent support for watching at 2x speed. You can watch one hour of lectures in 30 minutes, and at fast playback speeds the sound quality tends to be much better compared with the default web based playback.

To raise the playback speed, download the video to your local computer, open the file in VLC Media Player, then select "Playback..Speed" (or the "+" button on the numeric keypad on the right hand side of your keyboard).
T
You can also [use VLC Media Player to watch YouTube videos at 2x playback speed](http://www.labnol.org/software/youtube-videos-in-vlc-player/26829/). Select "Open..Network Stream", paste in the YouTube URL, then select the playback speed using "Playback..Speed". This is particularly useful when watching lectures referred to in Professor Leek's videos, such as [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data by Peter Norvig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvDCzhbjYWs).
