Welcome to the Course Wiki for <em>Comparative Democratic Development</em> (PS147).

You'll be collaborating here with classmates on a variety of projects that can facilitate deeper learning. We'll attempt to engage with the material covered in class in a more applied manner.

Since the Wiki is public, your contributions will also be shared with your classmates, the TAs and Professor Diamond.
