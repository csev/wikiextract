An anonymous student posted this to the forum in the first iteration of the course:  
  
*I wrote some Matlab/Octave code that might be interesting for those of you who want to play around with the differential equation governing the number of open and closed channels in a bioelectrical system. Given that there was no specific quiz question regarding this material I am assuming it is safe to do so. For best results save the 3 functions as three separate .m files.*
  
    function n = nchannels(t,alpha, beta, no, nc)
    %% nchannels
    %% Calculate number of open channels in a bioelectrical system
    %% The equation used is based on the solution to 
    %% dNo/dt = alpha*Nc - beta*No
    %%
    %% The following parameters are required:
    %% t        : time at which to calculate number of open channels (ms)
    %% alpha    : channel closing rate in 1/ms
    %% beta     : channel opening rate in 1/ms
    %% no       : initial number of open channels
    %% nc       : initial number of closed channels

    n = alpha*(no+nc)/(alpha + beta) + (no - alpha*(no+nc)/(alpha+beta))*exp(-t*(alpha+beta));
    
    end %nchannels

    function result = nchannelsIntSolve(t, alpha, beta, no, nc, stepsize)
    %% nchannelsIntSolve
    %% Calculate number of open channels in a bioelectrical system
    %%
    %% This function numerically integrates the following differential equation
    %% dNo/dt = alpha*Nc - beta*No
    %%
    %% The following parameters are required:
    %% t        : time at which to calculate number of open channels (ms)
    %% alpha    : channel closing rate in 1/ms
    %% beta     : channel opening rate in 1/ms
    %% no       : initial number of open channels
    %% nc       : initial number of closed channels
    %% stepsize : delta t for each iteration

    n = nc + no;

    for i = stepsize:stepsize:t
        dNo = stepsize*(alpha*nc-beta*no);
        no = no + dNo;
        nc = n - no;
    end

    result = no;

    end


    function nchannelPlot(t, alpha, beta, no, nc, stepsize)

    %% Plots the number of open channels as a function of time in a
    %% bioelectrical system
    %%
    %% Requires nchannels.m
    %%
    %%%% The following parameters are required:
    %% t        : time interval over which to plot (ms)
    %% alpha    : channel closing rate in 1/ms
    %% beta     : channel opening rate in 1/ms
    %% no       : initial number of open channels
    %% nc       : initial number of closed channels
    %% stepsize : resolution of the plot in units of ms

    x = stepsize:stepsize:t;
    y = nchannels(x,alpha,beta,no,nc);

    plot(x,y);
    xlabel('Time (ms)');
    ylabel('Number of open channels');

    end % nchannelPlot
