### What are we talking about?  
With all electrodes outside of cells, possibly on the skin:
* Observing voltages between these electrodes
* Seeing that the voltages change with time.
* Trying to make some sense of what is seen.  
  
Augustus Waller, late 1800s
* Trained his bulldog, Jimmy, to stand in 4 buckets of water  
* Measured the voltages between the buckets  
* Observed that the signal was periodic
* Observed that the biggest signal had a period that corresponded to the period of the dog's heart.  
* Also observed the need to feed Jimmy periodically

### Finger wave forms  
**Recording between finger on one hand and finger on the other (A simple experiment)**  
Simple experiment: Place electrodes on a finger of each hand and record the voltages from one electrode to the other.

**Caution – Safety Issue**  
Caution: Trying this experiment is not a part of this course. Please be aware that an approved experimental protocol may be required.  
There can be a shock hazard because there are electrodes tightly coupled to the body. Be sure to use approved equipment to avoid any shock hazard.  
  
**Noise, because signals are small.**  
* “Noise” is often defined as any unwanted signal.  
* If our interest on the recording is the cardiac signal, there is a lot of noise on the recording from body electrodes.  
* Noise is an issue in most kinds of extracellular recordings.  
  
**Comments**  
* The recording shows a voltage that changes with time.  
* There are periodic large signals perhaps 0.8 sec apart.  
* There are a lot of lower level deflections.  
* How do we begin to understand what is happening? Where is this stuff coming from?

### Single Fiber Extracellular Wave Forms  
What is happening outside the fiber, for a single fiber?  
First, let’s look at the wave forms that are observed.  
  
**Experimental setup**  
  
  
[[File:BE-week7-experiment-setup.png‎ ]]  
  
  
* Single fiber, uniform, so it has the most simple structure.  
* One stimulator, designated R (towards the left-hand of the fiber).  
* 2 electrodes  
:* 1 electrode is a penetrating electrode, will tell us the transmembrane voltage.  
:* The other electrode is an electrode outside the fiber, which will tell us the voltage outside, relative to a reference that's a long distance away.

### Wave forms at starting and ending sites  
**Ends Setup**  
  
**Extra Ends Wave Forms**  
  
**Single Fiber Xmem and Extra-cellular**  
  
**Wave Shape as Discriminant**  
* Extra cellular wave forms can be used to determine the excitaiton sequence.  
* The wave shape is useful, as well as wave timing.  
* For biphasic waveforms, the upstroke of the action potential corresponds to the intrinsic deflection of the extracellular wave form.

### Origin of Ve, An Experiment  
**Origin of Ve experiment, the Setup**  
  
**Origin of Ve, Vm(t) to Vm(x)**  
  
**Origin of Ve, Im(x) to Ve(t)**

### Single Fiber Spatial Vm, Im, and Sources  
**Sources and Sinks, Drawing**  
  
**Equation**  
  
**Straight-edge estimation from Vm(x)**  

---  
  
### Magnitude of Io 
**Magnitude and Sign of Io**  
* We need  
:* the resistivity [Ri = 30, Re=20 Ohm-cm here] the radius [a= 10 um in most cases here] 
:* the 2nd spatial derivative of Vm  
  
:* How does one find an actual number value for Io?  
Or, we need a graph of Im(x). That is never available, experimentally, though sometimes it is, in a simulation.

### Electrocardiograms   
* Electrocardiography is about obtaining and interpreting written records of the electrical signals of the heart.  
* Einthoven, in Holland, received the Nobel Prize in 1924 for demonstrating that the electrocardiogram was systematically different in patients with different kinds of heart problems.  
* The best way to interpret electrical signals from the heart remains a research topic even today.  
  
**Heart within Body, Sketch**  
  
**Lead Waveforms**  
* ECGSIM is a fantastic computer tool for visualizing and connecting electrical signals in the heart with those on the body surface.  
* It has been created and made available by Adriaan van Oosterom and colleagues, who are authorities in this field.  
* www.ecgsim.org (Available for many purposes free of charge.)

### Problem session, sources as dipoles  
**Source pairs as dipoles - Q**  
* Derive an expression that gives the potential from a sourcesink pair in a single term.  
* Assume that the distance between the source and sink is much smaller than the distance to the field point.  
  
**Hints**  
* Derive an expression that gives the potential from a sourcesink pair in a single term.  * Assume that the distance between the source and sink is much smaller than the distance to the field point.  
* Think of the distance from the sink to the source as a vector p. Think of the distance from the pair to the field point as another vector r.  
* The result will depend on the dot product of these 2 vectors.

### Week 7 in review  
1. Extracellular voltages are present across fingers, with a complex wave shape, though a heartbeat is visible.  
  
2. .A much simpler wave shape, largely biphasic, is seen from an extracellular electrode near a single fiber.  
  
3. The leading edge of the excitation wave, seen outside the fiber, has positive potential and the trailing edge is negative.  
  
4. Sources and sinks are readily identify from the curve of Vm(x) or Im(x)  
  
5. Though the geometry is hugely different, wave shapes of similar polarity arise from excitation waves in the heart.  
  
**An enormous and wide-ranging subject**  
* We have barely scratched the surface.  
* The recording and interpretation of extracellular signals is an enormous and wide-ranging subject.  
* The industry devoted to manufacture of specialized instruments for recording and display is large and varied.  
* The modes and principles of wave form interpretation is highly developed by specialists in related medical fields, for example, by cardiologists for wave forms from the heart.
