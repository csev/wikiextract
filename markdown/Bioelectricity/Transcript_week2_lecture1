Greeting once again! I'm Roger Coke Barr, the instructor for our course Bioelectricity, and this is week number two. First week I thought was interesting, but it's nothing like the second week. In this second week, someone was asking me this morning, where do these bioelectric systems get their energy? They were meaning, where do they get voltages, because after all, they're submerged in salt water. That's a really good question, but it's all been solved, and this week you get to find out how. It's an exciting week and I think you will enjoy it. Let's get started.
