## What are limits?

A limit is the value that a function or sequence "approaches" as the input or index approaches some value. Limits are an essential part of calculus (and mathematical analysis in general), and are used to define [[Calc1:Continuity|continuity]], [[Calc1:Derivatives|derivatives]], and [[Calc1:Integrals|integrals]].

In formulas, limit is usually abbreviated as lim as in lim(an) = a, and the fact of approaching a limit is represented by the right arrow (→) as in an → a.
