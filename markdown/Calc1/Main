Welcome to the Calculus One wiki page!

If you've recently solved a tough issue or gotten helpful advice about a review question, exercise, or the video lectures, please take some time to help out your fellow classmates by writing about it in the appropriate wiki page. Feel free to create pages as needed. To see how to edit or create a page, see "Help" on the left navbar.

## What will I learn in this course?

By the end of this course, you will know about the following subjects/topics:

* [[Calc1:Functions|Functions]].
* [[Calc1:Limits|Limits]].
* [[Calc1:InfiniteLimits|Infinite limits]].
* [[Calc1:LimitsAtInfinity|Limits at infinity]].
* [[Calc1:LimitLaws|Limit Laws]].
* [[Calc1:Continuity|Continuity]].
* [[Calc1:IVT|The Intermediate Value Theorem]].


## Lecture Notes

Different students have different learning styles, and having written notes to accompany the video lectures will be very useful to students who prefer learning by reading. Contributing to these notes will help those students, and will also help you internalize what you just learned!

You can get to the lecture videos by going [here](https://class.coursera.org/calc1-001/lecture/index).
