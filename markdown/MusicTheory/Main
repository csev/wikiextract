This is a student-created Wiki which anyone can contribute to.  The transcripts are created directly from the txt video subtitles, and as such copyright remains with the authors, the music staff at Edinburgh University.

I'll try to publish transcripts based on each video, each lecture, weekly (if I can)

There may be other materials that would soon get lost if made in a forum post; useful notes, websites etc. They can also go here.   If you want to add new sections, new pages, please do so.  Or ask for help in getting the formatting to be consistent.   But please don't disclose quiz questions or answers or anything else that might cause offence.
