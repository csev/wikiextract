Welcome to the Computational Neuroscience  wiki page!  
  
This wiki will be collaboratively created by students for the Computational Neuroscience course given by Adrienne Fairhall and Rajesh P. N. Rao (April 2013). [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) defines Computational Neuroscience as "the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system.[1](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computational-neuroscience) It is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology with electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics and physics."
