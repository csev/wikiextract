##Motivation

- A case study in motivation (purely based on subjective experience) is the difference between the stand-alone version of the computer game Bejewelled and its facebook-enabled social sibling Bejewelled Blitz. While Bejewelled Blitz was apparently conceived as a teaser to bring in buyers for the "full version", the Bejewelled Blitz version has developed an attraction of its own, founded on social integration (leaderboard against your friends), the challenge of improving ones score by better performance in pattern recognition and tactics and the time limit of one minute. Especially the later provides an addictive quality, because, while the full version offers all kinds of modes and features, the one minute limit on the Blitz version transmits the message, that just one more will not really take that much time. Until the night is over, of course...
