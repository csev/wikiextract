## Gamification References From Literature/Fiction

* Orson Scott Card: [Ender's Game](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812550706/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0812550706&linkCode=as2&tag=enterprisegam-20) - Ender's Game is a classic sci-fi novel that was published in the early 80s and presents gamification

* Charles Stross: [Halting State](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2465684W/Halting_State) - A fun science-fiction of taking gamification to the extreme, cyberpunk style. In particular the real-world implication of maintaining the economic balance of a MMORPG and the real-world interface are very interesting. And the book is a treat for any Scottish nationalist ;-)

* Daniel Suarez: [Daemon](http://www.amazon.com/Daemon-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0451228731/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1349181798&sr=8-1&keywords=daemon) - A designer of computer games dies, leaving behind a program that unravels the Internet's interconnected world. It corrupts, kills, and runs independent of human control. It's up to Detective Peter Sebeck to wrest the world from the malevolent virtual enemy before its ultimate purpose is realized: to destroy civilization.


## Gamification References from Film
* [The Last Starfighter](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDQQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Last_Starfighter&ei=3btZUKDQJ7CN0wWl5IHQAw&usg=AFQjCNGnwf2S78G9pvw4QZksLHN8xtRf2Q), where an alien race is installing a video game to identify assess candidates for starfleet pilots on Earth, specifically considering that Earth at that point had not connected with other civilizations in outer space. The film is from 1984, but already illustrates concepts like tailoring your system to a target group and use a gamified system for the area of recruiting, an application so far not widely used in the real world. 

## A bit off topic, but still relevant
* Benjamin Gilad: [Business War Games - How large, small and new companies can vastly improve their strategies and outmaneuver the competition](http://openlibrary.org/books/OL16865274M/Business_war_games) - While this book maybe fits better in the serious games category, it is relevant for the gamification context in two aspects, 1) it transfers the war game concept into the business context and 2) it analyses the game elements and design principles that make for a successful war game in great detail.
* Nicola Whitton, Alex Moseley: [Using Games to Enhance Learning and Teaching: a beginners guide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415897726/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0415897726&linkCode=as2&tag=enterprisegam-20) - a good critical starting point for the wider field of games-based-learning (education focus), which covers gamification along with deeper integration of game principles.
