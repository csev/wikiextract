[ISBN Bingo](http://www.twitter.com/gyldendal) Minimalist gamification (or is it just a game?) by Danish publishing company Gyldendal. Each Friday the crane (corresponding to their logo) draws 2 numbers and tweets them using the #fredagsbog (Friday Book - a customer engagement activity that asks people what they are reading on Fridays). The participants then need to find a book with an ISBN number with the drawn numbers as the last 2 digits. The first person to tweet ”BANKO + the author of the book + title + #fredagsbog + #ISBNBingo” wins (You have to remember the plus signs). The Winner receives a current book or one just to be released by the publisher. A very simple game, but also very effective. Full rules here: http://gyldendal.dk/artikler/isbnbingofall11 <br>

I have an interesting example of a very minimalistic and analog example of gamification (just to show that while digital certainly has more stroke, analog can be valuable and very simple). Our catering company has introduced a competition in the company canteen, which is called "Beat the alarm clock". The principle is that they have an i-Phone sitting at the check-out till with an alarm set to a time during lunch break, which is not known or visible. And whoever is at the till when the alarm goes off, gets his meal for free. A nice way to encourage people to eat in the cafeteria, but also lighten the mood in the waiting queue, and without much effort. I found that a nice case study.

In the UK, Green Sheild stamps were one of the first 'loyalty' techniques, and there is discussion on this public wiki page about how Tesco, a large supermarket, built upon it

Other examples are toys 'collect the set' from either McDonalds/Kellogs
