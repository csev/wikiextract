###Lecture 11.1 - Pointsification

The promise of gamification is to learn from games, to draw on what makes games so powerful and apply it in other contexts.
So it's a fair question to ask whether gamification can or in fact does actually accomplish that? And there are many who
argue that it doesn't. This criticism goes by the name of pointsification. A term that was coined by Margaret Robertson. A
British game developer in her blog Hide and Seek. And in her original post back in 2010, what she argued and what many other had since developed in other ways is that gamification is about taking the things that is least essential from games and representing it as the core of the experience. In other words gamification relies just on the surface aspects of
games. The mechanics. The other game elements. And what she says is that's not the important stuff. That's not the part
of games that makes them wonderful. That gets people to play and that stimulates that powerful set of motivational aspects
that we've talked about in the course. So what she says is, as she goes on in the post, effectively gamification is an
inadvertent con. It's genuine. It's trying to take something valuable from games but it's taking the wrong thing. And in so
doing it's inadvertently misleading people. It's suggesting to people that what's great about games is that they have
things like point systems and leaderboards. When in fact that's not what's central or important about games at all. And there's a great deal of bite to this criticism. As we've talked about many gamified system rely principally on points, badges, leaderboards and a few other surface level game mechanics. And, well may that have some valuable fact that
we can link them to other sorts of activities like loyalty programs. They don't necessarily produce the sense of true engagement and the sense of intrinsic motivation, that's so important to really changing behavior and really producing
sustained results in ways that are beneficial for people involved in the system. So there is a legitimate criticism
here around pointsification. But to my mind it's one that can be addressed by thinking about gamification more broadly.
As I've talked about, there really are two streams of work that feed into gamification. The one that Robertson and
the other critics are talking about when they label it pointsification is entirely on the behavioral side. And it's the
shallower aspects of applying those behavioral techniques through gamification. Again, predominately using simple mechanics like points and leader boards, and thinking that they can just be slapped onto processes and produce results. I would certainly agree that that's limiting, and that, that doesn't produce the same kinds of powerful results that we can see from games, but... Gamification at least appropriately thought of is much more than that. So part of the criticism of pointification is focusing in on a limited set but a very real set of gamification examples and practises. And I think that we can take it to heart without necessarily writing off the entire practice of gamification. But an important question this raises is whether gamification really is effective. 

Robertson as a game designer was concerned about gamification having the effect of belittling games. That if people started
to think, "Oh wait. Games are just about points and badges and stuff like that." And those really aren't that effective. So
therefore games must not be that interesting or powerful, either. As a game designer, that was her concern. She wasn't
particularly concerned about gamification as a practice. But those of us who are in the gamification field certainly are. And so it's worth asking whether if gamification reduces to pointsification, then that means that it won't produce the
kind of sustained, important, deep engagement that's necessary to drive real business results and real behavior change.
And the challenge here is we don't have a tremendous amount of research. In this course, I have given you many different
examples, some anecdotal, some involving data points. But we don't have yet significant empirical research, systematically looking at different forms of gamification and the results that it can provide in the enterprise, in external marketing context, in behavior change context. 

There are social scientists, people like my colleague, Ethan Mollick, here at the Wharton School, who started to do research in this area. And I think that we'll see research start to come about that informs gamification practice. But up
to this point, it's limited. I think there's enough examples. Again, we've seen many of them in this course that suggest
that these techniques are valid, and can work if designed and applied appropriately. But we don't yet know as much as we need to about what the data really show in large scale practical deployments. 

The second issue that this comes to is that gamification if it does reduce to pointsification, if most of the time or at least some of the time it turns out to just be about using these shallow elements. There's a very real risk that engagement may spike initially but will then decay. That people may feel that initial boost from the surprise or the activity and engagement loops of feedback. But ultimately if they're just driven by those behaviourist rewards or just driven by the surface level mechanics they'll get bored. And that won't produce an induring response. That's I think a fair criticism
and something to be aware of in designing gamified systems. And yet another reason. Not to just stop by thinking about these simple points based mechanics. 

The third aspect of this is one that we've already talked about, which is the potential for crowding out, or over justification. So, if in fact gamification becomes just pointsification, then it falls victim to all the dangers of extrinsic rewards that I described in some of the psychology sections. 

All of this together is what is like Kathy Sierra, who is a noted author and speaker around interaction design and programming in other areas. She has been a frequent critic of gamification and has labeled it, I think very powerfully as the high fructose corn syrup of engagement and what I think she's saying there is first of all that it takes the richness, the real organic value of games and of human engagement, and reduces it down to something very simplistic and very shrill. And that it's something like corn syrup high fructose corn syrup that seems great because it's sweet and cheap. But that as we learn more turns out to potentially be harmful for us. In the sense here, that if we rely too much on these simplistic, external reward based systems, that it will push people away from the true intrinsic motivation. Love of the activity, love of the task, love of the process. That is what should ultimately be driving them. And as with the pointsification critic more broadly, this is something worth taking into account. Now, again I tend to think that its not a fatal critic of all of gamification for the reason that are described in the course but its something that you should always have in mind when designing systems. And always try to think about how avoid sliding down that path where infact what you are doing is not gamafiying, but just applying point systems or applying game mechanics and other game elements in situations where they are not truely appropriate. 

So, let's turn back to the Foursquare example. Foursquare, in many ways, was a tremendous success story for gamification. The use of game elements, the badges, the points and so forth, on top of the social location system that was pioneered by Dodgeball, helped power Foursquare to tremendous success and tremendous adoption. But along the way something interesting happened. Early in 2012 Foursquare did a redesign. They changed the interface of the system in a way that appeared to significantly de-emphasize the game elements. So here you see some screen shots of the Foursquare iPhone client. And you see here's one main screen that shows information about your friends and where they are and information that yo u can
post. And you notice. Not a lot of game elements actually there. And here's the screen showing your friends, where they've
checked in on the map. Again, the game elements aren't that prominent. It's only when you get to this third screen here
that we see. The stats with the crown we see the badges that you've accomplished, that you've achieved and so forth. So the
game elements are still there, but they appear to much less prominent. So the question is what lesson to draw from this
and I think one can draw a couple of different lessons. 

One conclusion is.. Gamification didn't work. The game elements either didn't actually produce business results or maybe they did for a while but then people got bored. People got tired of them. The badges just became something silly and not something that really motivated people to want to check in and participate in the service. 

Or maybe another conclusion one could draw is that the game elements are still there. And still important to the service. But it was much more important to make them prominent during the early days when Foursquare was trying to grow, trying to get out of that trap that I described early on, where there was no reason for people to check in if their friends were checking in. And there were no real super-users who had a motivation to go and check in all the time at certain location and post information. So perhaps the game elements were particularly important during that growth phase for the company. And now that it reached the critical mass, where the key is monetization and building out off of the large number of users to real rich informational and social value that people can extract out, and that gets people to put more deep information into the system. Maybe at that point. The point, badge and leader board type game elements are less central. 

So you can decide whichever of those stories you think persuades you or maybe some other story. But again, in thinking about gamefication in practice , it behooves everyone to try to keep questioning whether this is a technique that's worth
using. I think it's one that can be extremely valuable in many different areas. Going from very lightweight systems
to much more sophisticated deployments. But it's, again, not something that's useful for everyone, and not something
that's useful in every single case. 

So, what are some implications to take away from this discussion? First, **names are powerful**. Much of the fire behind the criticism of gamification from game designers hinges on the word, gamification. Because it implies that this is about games. And I think, if you think about it broadly as I have talked about, it is. It involves using many different aspects of games and many different aspects of game design practice. But it is true that if gamification is just pulling out points at the few other mechanics, then it is something substantially less. Than the full panoply of richness that games entail. So names matter. The problem is names are names, and gamification is the name that has stuck. Maybe eventually it will go away or change into something else, but for now it's the word that gets used for this practice. 

Second point is, **bad gamification is bad**. So it's true that if gamification just uses points, badges, and leader boards, especially if it does it in a very shallow way, and certainly there are many examples of that today, that it's going to be limited. It's not going to produce sustained engagement,and it may, in fact, be harmful. It may, in fact, produce the kind of backlash, the crowding out effect that we described in the discussion of behaviorism and psychology. 

Third point is that **there's more to games than gamification**. So games do involve many other aspects beyond the ones that we've talked about in this class. And there's more to gamification than games. Gamification draws upon areas like phsychology and design and business practice and social media in many ways that go beyond or go in different directions than game design and that's fine. That's one reason it's important to keep straight whether we're talking about games including for example serious game design. Or talking about gamification where the goal is to apply to some non-game context. 

And, final lesson here. **Caveat Ludor, let the gamifier beware**. Make sure to always keep in mind. The difference between gamification and pointsification and to recognize the bite that, that criticism has.
