[[File:Releases gamification.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Trying out some gamification concepts after class @ work. Letting developers draw software alphabetical release names as silhouettes. The theme here is sea creatures, so Dolphin, Eel, Frog, Goldfish,.... The drawings need to be more detailed as the application becomes more coplex, so players have to find innovative ways to draw them with only one color at their disposal.  David, Belgium]]
