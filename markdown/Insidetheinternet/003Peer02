**Choose an element or aspect of the TCP/IP architecture and write a simple essay explaining how it works to a non-technical person. Do not reuse an example from the lectures in the class - come up with your own example. So don't use "postcards" to explain IP. Your essay should choose one (or more) technical terms like "CSMA/CD", "DHCP", "InternetNetwork Layer", or anything else from the topics in the class. Explain how the concept you have chosen functions in a way that someone not taking the class could understand what we are talking about. This is about writing for a non-technical audience.**
