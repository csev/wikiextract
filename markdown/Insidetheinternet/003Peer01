**Write an essay about how your first encountered the Internet or an earlier networking technology.   Describe the technologies you were using, some of the activities you did "on line", and tell us how having a new form of communication changed the way you think about the world.   If possible connect your own history to the history described in this class.  If your first experience was on another large-scale network like France's Minitel that is a great topic as well.**
