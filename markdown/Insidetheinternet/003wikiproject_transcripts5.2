[MUSIC][NOISE] 
. 
I was extraordinarily lucky and happened 
to be at the Xerox Research, Xerox Palo 
Alto Research Center when a, a problem 
evolved that had never before occurred, 
the problem had never occurred. 
And that was the problem of having a 
building full of personal computers. 
And I was the networking guy, so they 
turned to me and said, network these 
puppies. 
And we bad just finished starting the 
internet.

 
It was the called the arpanet, which was 
packet switching. 
And it was pretty clear we wanted this 
network to connect to the, it wasn't yet 
called the internet, thing. 
So, it would be packet switch, we were 
pretty sure. 
At the same time, we were building, 
arguably, I don't want to get into that 
argument. 
The first laser printer, which in our 
case, the first one, whose name was Ears. 
That's a whole other story.
 
It was a page per second, 500 dots per 
inch, and if you do the math, that's 
about 20 megabits per second. 
So the existing methods of 
interconnection had a lot of problems. 
One is that they were all home run, so 
all these wires, one from every desk, are 
all coming to this one place in the 
building and put a big rat's nest. 
We called it a rat's nest by the way. 
Two is they generally ran at 200 bits per 
second or. 
If you really rate them up, they go to 14 
4 kilobits per second, and that wasn't 
even close to 20 megabits per second. 
And we wanted to be able to keep the 
printer busy by sending documents from 
all these PCs which hadn't been built 
yet.

 
 >> Except at park. 
 >> Well, they hadn't been built even at 
Park at that point. 
 >> Okay. 
 >> So we were building the printer.
 
We were building the PCs all at the same 
time. 
So, I started worked on this, and there 
was a preceding effort before mine called 
Signet at Park. 
And it was being done by Charles Simony, 
my friend, and but he wasn't a networking 
guy, so they sent me in to pick up Signet 
from Charles. 
And he was going to go off and do 
something else. 
And by the way the other thing he did, is 
he wrote a word a text editor, a word 
processor, called Bravo, which then 
became Microsoft Office.
 
So, Charles is a billionarie and he has 
been to the space station. 
Twice, the International Spa. 
So maybe I shouldn't have kicked him off 
Signet, maybe I should have done Bravo. 
I don't know. 
Anyway, so I, immediately decided that 
Signet, by the way, SIGNet stands for 
Simonyi's Infinitely Glorious Network was 
in fact infinitely glorious and much had 
too many moving parts to be a LAN. 
By the way, the word LAN wasn't invented 
until 1990, and this is still 1973, so 
the word LAN was still way in the future, 
so that's an anachronism. 
Anyway, the Signet had too many moving 
parts for a LAN.
 
And it was in the course of investigating 
how to organize this LAN that I ran into 
a packet, quite by accident, a packet 
radio network at the University of Hawaii 
that was called the Aloha Net. 
And what was beautiful about the Aloha 
Network was it had a solved a distributed 
problem. 
That is, how would we share a radio 
channel back to the mainframe in, in 
Hawaii, at the university? 
If we're just a bunch of terminals 
scattered among the Hawaiian islands and 
they couldn't really easily talk to each 
other to get coordinated? 
How would they coordinate their sharing 
of this inbound radio channel? 


And Norm Abramson, there at the 
University of Hawaii devised this very 
simple randomized retransmission 
procedure, where a person would type. 
By the way what they would type was a 
card image. 
It was 80 columns wide, back from the 
days of card batch processing. 
So, you would type in your card image and 
hit send. 
And then your terminal would send it in 
toward the main frame, and then would 
wait a short time to see if there was an 
acknowledgement that returned on the 
outbound channel. 
And if there was, everything was 
hunky-dory, but if there wasn't, that 
probably meant that two terminals decided 
to send at the same time. 
So, then as many terminals particpated in 
that collision of transmissions would 
then randimoize and then re-transimit at 
a random time in the future. 
That way if they overlapped here they 
would not overlap again in the future 
because thye would choose different 
random numbers to count down. 
So that's randomizory transmission, 
multiple access. 
Since I was trying to avoid this big 
rat's nest of wires and only wanted to 
have one wire, just one wire and not 16 
or 32 or whatever the alternatives were, 
just one.
 
I wanted a distributed solution to how to 
share this cable, and the Aloha Network 
produced that using randomized 
retransmissions. 
So then, I, 
Actually y'know, there's sort of two 
stories here. 
One is a hardware story. 
 >> I was wonderin' about the hardware. 
 >> There's a hardware story, and 
there's a software story.
 
And the hardware story is , not that 
interesting but it's there. 
So one of the first things I did was to 
buy, a kilometer of cable, or it may have 
been a mile I don't know if I'd gone 
metric yet, but I. 
So a spool of coax cable about this big, 
with the two ends sticking up. 
So I got a, pulse generator and I hooked 
it up to one end and hooked it around 
back into the oscilloscope, and started 
launching square waves down the cable and 
watching what came out. 
I thought that would be good preparation 
for building a network. 
And what came out the other side wasn't a 
square wave. 
It was sort of lazy rise times and lazy 
fall times. 
But if you put a digital gate, you could 
recover the square wave. 
That is just set, use the digital 
threshold, so out of this gate came a 
square wave. 
So you could recover, at the end of a 
mile of cable this square wave. 
So I kind of knew. 
I kind of had some confidence then that 
we, that various stations connected to 
this cable could inject their square 
waves and, the other guys could recover 
them.
 
So that hardware wasn't that hard that 
did it was, a, straightforward.
 
 >> This was the first hardware. 
was it kind of relatively 
straightforward? 
 >> Very straightforward.
 
And the and the square ware , by the way 
was called Manchester. 
What we'd do is we'd take the bit, we'd 
make a packet of bits, and then we'd send 
them one at a time down this cable, and 
we would encode them. 
And the encoding was also simple, it was 
Manchester coding. 
Meaning that for each bit the first half 
of the bit would be the complement of the 
bit. 
And the second half of the bit would be 
the bit. 
So you would have a transition in the 
middle of each bit cell, which is a very 
simple modulation scheme. 
So as you're sending the packet the 
cables wiggling and you can recover the 
signal at the other end then. 
Clock those bits into a shift register, 
and then click the sh, clock the shift 
register into the memory, and then 
collect a packet that way.
 
 >> And that all took just some 
soldering to make that all happen 
basically. 
 >> Well I don't wanna[LAUGH]. 
It got a little bit complicated when you 
wanted to put 255 of them on a mile of 
cable. 
You had to be a little bit careful about 
the impedance on the taps. 
 >> Okay. 
 >> because the square wave by a tap 
might generate reflections that would 
then interfere.
 
But the beauty of Manchester encoding was 
that while you were sending a packet, 
there were constant transitions. 
So if you listened, you could tell 
whether a packet was going by and you 
didn't have to listen for long. 
You only had to listen for about a bit 
time, which turned out to be 340 
nanoseconds. 

So you could wait that long, and tell 
whether there was a packet going by. 
So one of the first differences between 
the Ethernet, and the Aloha net, we got a 
lot of differences, but one of the first 
ones was carrier sense. 
In the Aloha network. 
You couldn't tell if somebody else was 
transmitting at the same time as you, but 
on the Ethernet, you could. 
And the advantage of that was, you might 
as well, if you're sending and somebody 
else is sending at the same timeyou might 
as well give up, because you've destroyed 
each other's packets, so punt. 
Then that recovers that bandwidth that 
otherwise would be lost just continuing 
to transmit a damaged packet.
 
And the the other was this, this 
Manchester code meant that the cable was 
on half the time and of half the time. 
That is the, the driver, so the open, 
what we used to call an open collector 
driver would either yank the cable up to 
three, four, five volts. 
I even forget the voltage now. 
but it was under five, I'm sure of that. 
I had a rule. 
I never went above five volts. 
you would yank the cable up. 
And then during the other half of the bit 
when you weren't yanking you let go. 
So, so for example in each bit cell you 
got to look to see if anyone else was 
transmitting when you had stopped. 
And if there was somebody else, then you 
had a collision.

 
So that was the second feature. 
 >> So it was really a digital signal. 
It was really a digital signal, it wasn't 
a modulated signal in any way. 
 >> Right? 
 >> No,well it was, 
 >> At best you could send additional 
signal over[UNKNOWN]. 
 >> On/off, with the Manchester 
encoding.
 
So Manchester encoding is akin to a 
modulation scheme. 
But it's the simplest one you can think 
of. 

 >> It's very base bane. 
 >> Yeah, it's very base bane. 
But it's the sort of modulation scheme 
that a computer scientist would come up 
with as apposed to one of those fancy 
 >> Radio people. 
 >> Radio people. 
 >> Right. 
So, and, and by the way, took a lot of 
gas from those radio people. 
Why do you use such a simple scheme? 
 >> Right. 
 >> You're wasting. 
 >> [CROSSTALK] . 
 >> You would have wasted all that, you 
wasted all that bandwidth. 
That capable, that cable was capable of 
carrying hundreds of megabits per seconds 
and you only carried 2.9 4. 
What a waste of the cable. 
 >> Exactly[/g] .

 
[LAUGH] Well, the --[LAUGH] there was 
plenty of cable to waste. 
So we talk about carrier sense inclusion 
detection, and the scheme would be that 
each packet would carry two addresses. 
The address of the destination and the 
address of the source. 
And each of these would be 8 bits. 
And so on the backplane of these little 
personal computers with wire app[SOUND]. 
You would wire app in a code between zero 
and 255 and that would be the serial 
number of the machine. 
And that, and then you'd read that off 
the back plane and put it in the pack. 
So each packet had two addresses.
 
This is different from the Aloha incident 
which had one address. 
Because the channel was only going. 
Through two channels. 
So two addresses, and we added a cyclic 
redundancy checksum on the end of the 
packet, which we implemented in hardware. 
So, that you in addition so you could 
tell if the packet had been damaged. 
So if there was a collision and the 
terminal, the contending stations backed 
off.
 
There would be a hunk of garbage on the 
cables sitting around. 
But when it was received, the check sum 
wouldn't add up and you'd just throw that 
chunk of garbage away. 
The day that I was launching pulses down 
this spool of cable, I was doing some 
soddering, and I was doing some knife 
work to get the insulation off the 
copper.
 
And across the room was a young grad 
student, who was doing something else and 
he noticed me not being good at this. 
And it turns out, he was very good at it, 
because he had worked in a television 
studio and he had worked in cable 
television. 
So he knew all about skinning wires and 
coaxes.

 
So he came over to help me, and that was 
da, his name was **David Boggs**. 
And then we started working together, and 
invented ethernet together. 
So, he was, and he was, he was, slightly 
more hardware, and I was slight more 
software. 
But there was then a third guy. 
Who was even more hardware than David. 
Who was the picofarad guy. 
The guy who would put those last few 
passive components on the end just to be 
sure, that, that connection to the 
coaxial cable would be clean for 
transmissions. 
Every time you tapped into it you didn't 
put a lump of impedance on it.
 
 >> Yeah, the tapping seems like a 
counter intuitive thing to me. 
I mean, think the, I mean everyone would 
think that a star is the right thing, but 
you were going to tap into that. 
Just tap into[UNKNOWN] . 
 >> One of the problems we decided to 
solve was the rat's nest problem.

 
We did not want a rats nest, and every 
time we installed a new PC we didn't have 
to home run a cable back to the rats 
nest. 
So we wanted to put one cable down the 
middle of the corridor and then every 
time you want to put a PC you just run up 
and tap into it. 
And we didn't want the network to go on, 
go down while you were tapping into it, 
because we wanted 24 by seven access to 
the network. 
So there had to be a way to tap into the 
network without bringing it down. 
So that led to a device we found in the 
cable TV industry.
 
It was called gerald tap, and it was 
basically a, a vampire tap.
 
You'd, you'd drill a little hole in the 
outer, casing of the coax, and then you 
would screw in this tap that would 
puncture the insulation and go right to 
the copper and tap in. 
And you notice in that operation you're 
not breaking the copper, so the network 
continues sending, you tap in, and you're 
now part of the network.
 
 >> So that came from the cable 
industry. 
 >> It did. 
 >> Oh, okay. 
 >> So a guy named David Ladell, who had 
done cable TV installations when he was 
in grad school in Toledo. 
suggested that we use the gerald tap 
since it was already being made in volume 
and worked just fine, as far as he was 
concerned. 
And it allowed us to solve the rat's 
nest, what we perceived to be an 
important problem, the rat's nest 
problem.
 
The Aloha network ran in the 
kilobit-per-second range, like 4800 or I 
don't remember the numbers, but kilobits 
per second. 
The Ethernet then started at 2.94 
megabit. 
And in those days, by the way, T1 was 
1.544 megabytes per second. 
So in 1973, the ethernet was already as 
fast as T1. 
Of course T1 is still around, oddly. 
But then we went from 2.94, we briefly 
went to 20 megabytes per second inside of 
Xerox.
 
And then when we bumped into DEC and 
Intel for the standardization process in 
802, we decided on ten. 
We came down from 20 to ten so the chips 
would work. 
And then we went from ten, and later, I 
helped found a company called Grand 
Junction Networks, that introduced the 
100-mg Ethernet. 
And I remember being at my coffee table 
in Palo Alto, I think it was. 
I forget the year. 
No, maybe it was in Woodside. 
But we were trying to think of how we 
would make a fast Ethernet, and there's 
some math that shows that if, as you go 
faster.
 
The efficiency depends on the diameter of 
the network, and as you go faster and 
faster, the efficiency goes down. 
The diameter of the network in bits. 
And when you're trying to up a factor of 
ten, and it I don't know who it was, one 
of us observed, that wait a minute, we've 
been assuming that Ethernet is a 
kilometer in diameter. 
But we're going, we're all going to hubs 
now so that we only need 100 meters, not 
1000 meters. 
And that was the factor of ten right 
there, so that by changing the collision 
interval. 

You maintain the same efficiencies, 
theoretical efficiencies by just assuming 
you're going 100 meters instead of a 
kilometer. 
So that got us to 100 megabits per second 
and not gigabit, ten gigabit which I 
guess is the mainstream now, and then 100 
gigabit is now beginning to run. 
100 gigabits per second. 
You can't, you can't be a computer 
scientist and build that kind of digital 
now. 
You have to actually be an engineer, a 
hardware engineer to run at a 100. 
 >> I think at that point, you're pretty 
much a radio person. 
 >> [LAUGH] But then after 100 gigabits 
comes terrabits, so i've already begun 
giving talks on terrabit ethernet.
