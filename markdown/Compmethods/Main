This is the course wiki for '[Computational Methods for Data Analyses][1]'


In this course exploratory and objective data analysis methods are applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis, spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing and compression form the main part of the course.

We also get to solve some serious problems using the full power of MATLAB's built in functions and routines.
